according to a report from the university of san diego ’ s justice in mexico project 138,000 people have been murdered in mexico since 2006. they call it the corner of heaven a laboratory a foot at the throat of an empire before the holy dirt the woman with the feline gait waits with tangled hair mouth agape — the letter x marked on what ’ s left of her breasts and face nuestra belleza mexicana a roped mule watches a man place a crown on her severed head tomorrow the queen will be picked clean by the kindness of the sea shuttered shops and empty restaurants stray dogs couple in a courtyard under a swaying palm tree a cluster of men finger golden pistols whisper aquí ni se paran las moscas two boys transfixed watch a pixelated video a family fed to a swarm of insatiable pigs a butcher sweeps blood from an empty street death is my godmother he repeats death is a burnt mirror when the crackling stereo dithers between stations — amor de mis amores sangre de mi alma — a gaggle of silent children gather before a sputtering trash bin together they watch the terror hover like flies
calm appeared his soul stopped a crow staring as he snatched down miniature angels trapped them in jars capping the light away to make a hush out of glory songs a crying out from the joyful aubades they breathe as easy as moonlight on jars of preserves their throats full of fear now the brave breast crumpled in his child fingers their prisons invisible to the cherubim searching for heaven 's missing songsters trapped in blind ways of getting even at a world that would make him small make him an impotent wonder curl his genius under like a witch 's toes when his father died chewing on cheese and cornbread chocolate surprise in the sun an unkind ending he grew in the way of genius no charts showing where he ended and the world began how cities figure in the jagged sweep of cornfields endless thousands of shouts up into the evening listening to the future speaking like the old man in the schoolyard a stranger by the wishing pond in the woods or dogs that stand up like men in hats— these the corinthian signs he mistook for an alphabet giving the right to molest children now wisdom is sour rubbing medicine pasted over nightmares not the proper wealth of an old man the arms of his neighbors around him like laurels
angelfish perturb the area around pink gauze are the details of a threaded diamond string and its fake catachrestic applause like that of the angelheaded beast spreading its wings as if to swim under the light of the glowworm and hyacinth the fish are oratory and not the pulchritude of bombazine on a shattering geoidal mid-afternoon dribbling from sea rock to splint the wing tips are hardly bleak accoutrements their own swinging by the bay of a chest and a previous rock here we are stranded pelagic with clot and the fish burble with oratory and i kind of like them a lot

1 just as there were reeds along the riverbank just as there were clouds above my head my lute was lying beside me on the grass i placed the little finger of my right hand on the soundboard just below the strings not the tip of the finger the side i curled the palm of my right hand towards me covering the strings so that i played the bass note with the thumb the next with the index and the top note with the third the sun retreated the night turned cold rain began to fall softly at first though surely rain had fallen here before as rain falls everywhere with my left hand i positioned my thumb and index finger opposite each other bearing no weight as if the neck of the lute were not there 2 at this they all laughed then the count began afresh my lords he said i am not pleased with the young man if he is not also a musician and if besides his cunning upon the book he have not skill in like manner on sundry instruments there is no ease of labor more honest and more praiseworthy especially at court where many things are taken in hand to please women whose tender breasts are soon pierced with melody then the lord gasper i believe music he said together with other vanities is mete for women also for them that have the likeness of men but not for them that be men indeed who ought not with such delicacies womanize their minds and so bring themselves to dread death — the first booke of the courtyer of count baldessar castilio 3 for many years i lived apart in happy oblivion in retrospect i understand i ’ d been a child though lacking comparisons i couldn ’ t have said so i learned things things no child left to himself could possibly know my head which had been empty now was full my head would grow larger how could it not at night standing in the shower i closed my eyes the water trickled down my forehead to my nose from my nose to my lips my chin then disappeared but some of what stayed in my head should not have been there 4 listen said the reeds along the riverbank the nymphs are weeping for daphnis his mother embraces his body railing against the stars nobody drives his cattle to the cool stream no one could drink the mountains echo with the beasts of the desert daphnis it was you who yoked them to the chariot who led us in the dance weaving together vine leaves with reeds the vine exceeds the tree on which it climbs the grape exceeds the vine the calf the herd the corn the field now where we planted barley thistles grow where once were violets hyacinths — nothing but weeds scatter the ground with flowers shepherds set out two bowls one of milk and one of oil then carve these lines from virgil on his tomb i was daphnis in these woods the stars knew my name beautiful the flock more beautiful the shepherd

there once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children a wandering sage saw the king ’ s grief and offered him a magical mango she who ate the mango would be with child as he had two wives the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife after nine months each wife gave birth to one lifeless half horrified the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest a wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm when she brought them together the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes—the demon named the child jarasandha years passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior in a fight with bhim an equally invincible warrior jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy but each time he was ripped apart his halves found a way to meet up and become whole krishna who witnessed how jarasandha ’ s flesh found its own way back to flesh motioned to his own cousin with his fingers toss the halves of his body in opposite directions he suggested so when bhim ripped jarasandha apart once again he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left and his body found no way to return to itself in the toronto airport where i ’ ve arrived for a conference i watch an older punjabi lady—made to sit in a wheelchair behind two lines of customs officials a security guard a translator and a service-staff member—scream that her son is outside the airport may she please just go tell him she is here she is here she is here please i stand there holding her hand my own luggage reluctantly traveling in loops on the belt beta—child— she says to me please tell them my son is here and i am here what is the problem let me go let me go to him

1. the candle will be our medium for dialogue we must always be on speaking terms 2. when you see the candle by the bedside burning it will be my message to you do not touch 3. you will heal through herbs the words i give you to spray unto the solution 4. never dress in black i may mistake you for someone ready to die 5. as much as possible do not speak wickedly or damn anyone 6. as much as possible stay away from funerals i like to work alone death is death ’ s work iku n ’ iku che 7. egun will be my messenger 8. you may also petition me through that white staff you know the one— with bells snail shells you also know the chant 9. do not be tempted by possessions titles if you have patience i will make possible those you actually will need 10. remember this pact i will give you health long life aiku all this was negotiated just prior to his birth he probably kneeled before the owner of the sky while iku his patron orisha and many egun sat watching with fly whisks in hand and full regalia after all one of their own was about to embark on his journey to the human world the ilé aiyé he probably placed in circular fashion inside a big calabash all his choices probably whispered into the gourd a slow `` ashé tó iba eshu '' we say probably because one thing is for sure el niño does not remember the details in fact no one does except the deities iku no one remembers the details of their creation no one remembers the destiny the mission they chose their personal orisha and most importantly the date of their last breath memory continuity keeping el hilo de la conversación never losing the wavy fragile link that keeps you grounded to yr root the dialogue with spirits that may tap yr left shoulder all that but no one remembers no one remembers ésto si es trágico in order to recall the details of what went on in the other world to map his destiny el niño must be taken for divination and even then one session won ’ t do it the story will get revealed as his life turns each page changes rhythm the oracle is cast several more times so they took el niño to the diviner edikán 's house after pouring libations reciting the necessary ayuba prayers—greeting the creator the ancestors the divination earth wind river ocean jungle crossroad orishas edikán cast the divining chain/ópele used by the babalawo a picture began to emerge he said the orishas egun collectively called ara orun or citizens of the other world have given us certain verses stories to deliver messages regarding the rhythms of our lives he said el niño ’ s patron deity is oshun but he will always have an affinity with ogun obatalá but most prominent is his close relationship with egun that is the ancestors iku ’ s messengers he said it would be through a kinship with egun that he would accomplish his most difficult tasks even the arts of divination he will be a mouthpiece for egun edikán said el niño has a predisposition to a vivid imagination because of this there are will be mysterious phenomena happening to him like visions dreams of secret songs he will not regard them as strange he said el niño should be taught even at an early age the rigors of an herbalist he should be taught at least how to recognize certain trees plants the healing properties of the most commonly used herbs their harvesting times how they mix with what substances all this will eventually lead to an encyclopedic knowledge not only of their healing properties but of their ability to alter the invisible rhythms that underlie most things edikán said there will be certain resguardos that must be prepared so as to begin bridging the gap between orishas iku egun himself even though el niño ’ s inner head/ori inu chose a good destiny in the other world such destiny must be aligned with his physical head/ori in this world it will be orishas egun that will focus his life help him fulfill the destiny he chose in the other world he said beginning with the feet el niño must be securely fastened to the earth so as to not depart too soon for the other world you see there is always the detail of iku being overprotective the relationship is like playing with a leopard—even an affectionate jab with its paw will cause a scar the head will also have to be ritually prepared fed with bits of white fruit among other ingredients thus given a firm root stability— “ para que su cabeza no esté en el aire ” he said we were witness to this event we heard what needed to be done there was actually a time maybe this is still going on when people consulted with the spirit world the other world on such occasions as the third month after birth we collected the ingredients that would shape his destiny began to assemble them much of them were from the river the jungle of course the cemetery we heard what needed to be done ara orun are hip to the images subtle rhythms that stories verses evoke the same images subtle rhythms running through our lives edikán said that barring some details of modernity his life would follow a certain ancient story pertaining to the divination— ofun is like this/ ofun ni jé bé— the page continues to turn.the rhythm the rhythm will come from dreams

the big doll being broken and the sawdust fall all scattered by my shoes not crying i sit in my dark to discover o failure annulled opens out in my hands a purse of golden salvaged sovereigns from floors of seas culled the dancing doll split in an anguish and all the cords of its elegant limbs unstrung i stumble whistling the bones of my skull marvelously start to sing the whole shell of myself invents without peril and contains a court aubade i hid the dovesmall doll but something found it frightened i gave the fire what was left surrounding it mulled dulcet over the melting jeweled two blue eyes that night our hearth was desolate but then its stones sprung flowered and the soaring rafters arched now all the house laughs the sun shouts out clearly dawn the sea owes us all its treasures under the soft the riotous explosion of our waking kiss or gift a stone plucked or shorn free of gravity falls upward for us slow and lies there quietly
they found you under twenty feet of loose ash — one vowel solo in an archipelago of strung-out vowels and doting volcanoes — isole eolie — o hoop of exhilaration o sigh of relief softening your votive mouth if not blowing off steam at the crater rim crystalizing sulfur poring over tomes the trade winds and furies that fan through your realm o citizen-king o sonorous persona weaned on fumes and that old itinerant intonation — air your woes all over again

this is the month and this the happy morn wherein the son of heav'n 's eternal king of wedded maid and virgin mother born our great redemption from above did bring for so the holy sages once did sing that he our deadly forfeit should release and with his father work us a perpetual peace that glorious form that light unsufferable and that far-beaming blaze of majesty wherewith he wont at heav'n 's high council-table to sit the midst of trinal unity he laid aside and here with us to be forsook the courts of everlasting day and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay say heav'nly muse shall not thy sacred vein afford a present to the infant god hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain to welcome him to this his new abode now while the heav'n by the sun 's team untrod hath took no print of the approaching light and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright see how from far upon the eastern road the star-led wizards haste with odours sweet o run prevent them with thy humble ode and lay it lowly at his blessed feet have thou the honour first thy lord to greet and join thy voice unto the angel quire from out his secret altar touch 'd with hallow 'd fire it was the winter wild while the heav'n-born child all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies nature in awe to him had doff 'd her gaudy trim with her great master so to sympathize it was no season then for her to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour only with speeches fair she woos the gentle air to hide her guilty front with innocent snow and on her naked shame pollute with sinful blame the saintly veil of maiden white to throw confounded that her maker 's eyes should look so near upon her foul deformities but he her fears to cease sent down the meek-ey 'd peace she crown 'd with olive green came softly sliding down through the turning sphere his ready harbinger with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing and waving wide her myrtle wand she strikes a universal peace through sea and land no war or battle 's sound was heard the world around the idle spear and shield were high uphung the hooked chariot stood unstain 'd with hostile blood the trumpet spake not to the armed throng and kings sate still with awful eye as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by but peaceful was the night wherein the prince of light his reign of peace upon the earth began the winds with wonder whist smoothly the waters kist whispering new joys to the mild ocean who now hath quite forgot to rave while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave the stars with deep amaze stand fix 'd in steadfast gaze bending one way their precious influence and will not take their flight for all the morning light or lucifer that often warn 'd them thence but in their glimmering orbs did glow until their lord himself bespake and bid them go and though the shady gloom had given day her room the sun himself withheld his wonted speed and hid his head for shame as his inferior flame the new-enlighten 'd world no more should need he saw a greater sun appear than his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear the shepherds on the lawn or ere the point of dawn sate simply chatting in a rustic row full little thought they than that the mighty pan was kindly come to live with them below perhaps their loves or else their sheep was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep when such music sweet their hearts and ears did greet as never was by mortal finger strook divinely warbled voice answering the stringed noise as all their souls in blissful rapture took the air such pleasure loth to lose with thousand echoes still prolongs each heav'nly close nature that heard such sound beneath the hollow round of cynthia 's seat the airy region thrilling now was almost won to think her part was done and that her reign had here its last fulfilling she knew such harmony alone could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union at last surrounds their sight a globe of circular light that with long beams the shame-fac 'd night array 'd the helmed cherubim and sworded seraphim are seen in glittering ranks with wings display 'd harping in loud and solemn quire with unexpressive notes to heav'n 's new-born heir such music as 't is said before was never made but when of old the sons of morning sung while the creator great his constellations set and the well-balanc 'd world on hinges hung and cast the dark foundations deep and bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep ring out ye crystal spheres once bless our human ears if ye have power to touch our senses so and let your silver chime move in melodious time and let the bass of heav'n 's deep organ blow and with your ninefold harmony make up full consort to th'angelic symphony for if such holy song enwrap our fancy long time will run back and fetch the age of gold and speckl 'd vanity will sicken soon and die and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould and hell itself will pass away and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day yea truth and justice then will down return to men orb 'd in a rainbow and like glories wearing mercy will sit between thron 'd in celestial sheen with radiant feet the tissu 'd clouds down steering and heav'n as at some festival will open wide the gates of her high palace hall but wisest fate says no this must not yet be so the babe lies yet in smiling infancy that on the bitter cross must redeem our loss so both himself and us to glorify yet first to those ychain 'd in sleep the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep with such a horrid clang as on mount sinai rang while the red fire and smould'ring clouds outbrake the aged earth aghast with terror of that blast shall from the surface to the centre shake when at the world 's last session the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne and then at last our bliss full and perfect is but now begins for from this happy day th'old dragon under ground in straiter limits bound not half so far casts his usurped sway and wrath to see his kingdom fail swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail the oracles are dumb no voice or hideous hum runs through the arched roof in words deceiving apollo from his shrine can no more divine with hollow shriek the steep of delphos leaving no nightly trance or breathed spell inspires the pale-ey 'd priest from the prophetic cell the lonely mountains o'er and the resounding shore a voice of weeping heard and loud lament from haunted spring and dale edg 'd with poplar pale the parting genius is with sighing sent with flow'r-inwoven tresses torn the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn in consecrated earth and on the holy hearth the lars and lemures moan with midnight plaint in urns and altars round a drear and dying sound affrights the flamens at their service quaint and the chill marble seems to sweat while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat peor and ba a lim forsake their temples dim with that twice-batter 'd god of palestine and mooned ashtaroth heav'n 's queen and mother both now sits not girt with tapers holy shine the libyc hammon shrinks his horn in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thammuz mourn and sullen moloch fled hath left in shadows dread his burning idol all of blackest hue in vain with cymbals ring they call the grisly king in dismal dance about the furnace blue the brutish gods of nile as fast isis and orus and the dog anubis haste nor is osiris seen in memphian grove or green trampling the unshower 'd grass with lowings loud nor can he be at rest within his sacred chest naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud in vain with timbrel 'd anthems dark the sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp 'd ark he feels from juda 's land the dreaded infant 's hand the rays of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn nor all the gods beside longer dare abide not typhon huge ending in snaky twine our babe to show his godhead true can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew so when the sun in bed curtain 'd with cloudy red pillows his chin upon an orient wave the flocking shadows pale troop to th'infernal jail each fetter 'd ghost slips to his several grave and the yellow-skirted fays fly after the night-steeds leaving their moon-lov 'd maze but see the virgin blest hath laid her babe to rest time is our tedious song should here have ending heav'n 's youngest-teemed star hath fix 'd her polish 'd car her sleeping lord with handmaid lamp attending and all about the courtly stable bright-harness 'd angels sit in order serviceable

cold cry from the last page of the dictionary name with a knife in it and the knife italic against the throat till you fall into so heavy a sleep — sleep made of asterisks and cattle the herd just a black scarf against snow — you can ’ t begin to guess where the old world went now there are only two choices says the tale and neither is good hence an axe above each separate entrance as the hero becomes hardly a voice and the sad dogs appear on the screen then there is a thin high scraping then no noise of any sort at all
they think she lives alone on the edge of town in a two-room house where she moved when her husband died at thirty-five of a gunshot wound in the bed of another woman the curandera and house have aged together to the rhythm of the desert she wakes early lights candles before her sacred statues brews tea of yerbabuena she moves down her porch steps rubs cool morning sand into her hands into her arms like a large black bird she feeds on the desert gathering herbs for her basket her days are slow days of grinding dried snake into powder of crushing wild bees to mix with white wine and the townspeople come hoping to be touched by her ointments her hands her prayers her eyes she listens to their stories and she listens to the desert always to the desert by sunset she is tired the wind strokes the strands of long gray hair the smell of drying plants drifts into her blood the sun seeps into her bones she dozes on her back porch rocking rocking
on the tip of a hill the silhouette is of something not of this world the body silent in the birth of another shadow swelling still among stars veins the sun dropping below the mountains left hardly any light except what glimmers on the membrane slips into the high grass alone i pulled over to the side of 81 where semis ’ blowing horns descend beyond the sloped field pieces of barbed wire snapped from the line i stepped through the fence its blood-colored rust rubbed into my hands for a moment it is something that stays with me like a memory that does not give up easily i try wiping my hands onto my jeans but nothing it is anything it wants to be—calf half-life angel—its fur a glaze of cricket sounds cool air a thing of stars burnt into hooves a haze i stood there not knowing whether it would be right to touch the one not breathing its nose drying in the grass next to my hands grit in the creases burning now with the dust of splinters like flies my fingers hover over the dead face
purportedly a chain of civilians soldiers voices lice they were called it is sometimes sufficient to beg lice creeping over one kill them with a chemical then there are lice-ghosts everywhere glints

never let you in you beautiful kids who haunt the corridors extending through the invisible world so you can find your way so you can see past the smoke of disastrous fear acting out of dreams it creeps everywhere see how it took them over for they had no mind to stand against any fantasy the instigators chose had no minds at all when i was little no one told me i ’ d have to suffer who can be

to let them come as far as inside you even empty enough i can hear them and render affection why if there ’ s nothing is this nothing but you are destroyed we shake all the time you remind me of someone else i knew the wing is inscribed forinvolute not to beg in the offering of primal services we have come here no one would let us tell anything but our bodily humiliations had to do differently not for redemption because we are more than redemption i am my maker the shape formed by the bits of mirror glued on is unimportant they ’ re inside my chest and stomach and they glitter

i the story of him who knew the most of all men know who made the journey heartbroken reconciled who knew the way things were before the flood the secret things the mystery who went to the end of the earth and over who returned and wrote the story on a tablet of stone he built uruk he built the keeping place of anu and ishtar the outer wall shines in the sun like brightest copper the inner wall is beyond the imagining of kings study the brickwork study the fortification climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace study how it is made from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields the ponds and orchards this is uruk the city of gilgamesh the wild ox son of lugalbanda son of the lady wildcow ninsun gilgamesh the vanguard and the rear guard of the army shadow of darkness over the enemy field the web the flood that rises to wash away the walls of alien cities gilgamesh the strongest one of all the perfect the terror it is he who opened passes through the mountains and he who dug deep wells on the mountainsides who measured the world and sought out utnapishtim beyond the world it is he who restored the shrines two-thirds a god one-third a man the king go to the temple of anu and ishtar open the copper chest with the iron locks the tablet of lapis lazuli tells the story ii there was no withstanding the aura or power of the wild ox gilgamesh neither the father 's son nor the wife of the noble neither the mother 's daughter nor the warrior 's bride was safe the old men said '' is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people '' the gods of heaven listened to their complaint `` aruru is the maker of this king neither the father 's son nor the wife of the noble is safe in uruk neither the mother 's daughter nor the warrior 's bride is safe the old men say 'is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people there is no withstanding the desire of the wild ox `` they called the goddess aruru saying to her '' you made this man now create another create his double and let the two contend let stormy heart contend with stormy heart that peace may come to uruk once again '' aruru listened and heard and then created out of earth clay and divine spittle the double the stormy-hearted other enkidu the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands powerful as ninurta the god of war the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles visits the watering places with the creatures whose hearts delight as his delights in water iii one day a hunter came to a watering place and saw enkidu he stood expressionless astonished then with his silent dogs he went home to his father 's house fear in his belly his face was as one estranged from what he knows he opened his mouth and said to his father `` father i saw a hairy-bodied man today at the watering place powerful as ninurta the god of war he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles he visits the watering places with the beasts he has unset my traps and filled my hunting pits the creatures of the grasslands get away free the wild man sets them free because of him i am no longer a hunter '' his father said `` go to uruk and there present yourself to gilgamesh the king who is the strongest of all the perfect the terror the wise shepherd protector of the people tell him about the power of the wild man ask him to send a harlot back with you a temple prostitute to conquer him with her greater power when he visits the watering place let her show him her breasts her beauty for his wonder he will lie with her in pleasure and then the creatures the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' so the hunter went to gilgamesh in uruk and told him about the power of the wild man and how he had unset the traps and filled the pits so that the creatures got away free the lord of uruk said to the hunter then '' when you return a temple prostitute will go with you and with her beauty conquer the wild man he will lie with her and then the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' iv the harlot and the hunter traveled together taking three days back to the watering place for three more days they waited and finally enkidu came with the creatures that love the water the gazelles and the others so as to drink their fill the temple prostitute looked at him enkidu the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle `` that is enkidu shamhat show him your breasts show him your beauty spread out your cloak on the ground lie down on it the wild man will look at you show him your body the hairy-bodied man will come to you and lie down on you and then show him the things a woman knows how to do the gazelles and with them all the other creatures will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' and so the harlot shamhat showed him her breasts showed him her body the hairy-bodied man came over to her and lay down on her and then she showed him the things a woman knows how to do for seven days enkidu in his wonder lay with her in pleasure and then at last went to seek out the company of the creatures whose hearts delight in feeding upon the grasslands and visiting the watering places and ranging the hills but seeing him they fled the creatures were gone and everything was changed his body that loved to range the hills was now unable to follow but in the mind of the wild man there was beginning a new understanding bewildered he turned and sought out the company of the temple prostitute he sat down beside her and looked into her face and listened to her '' enkidu now you are beautiful as a god why do you seek the company of beasts come with me to the city to uruk to the temple of anu and the goddess ishtar gilgamesh is the ruler the strongest of all the terror the aura and power of his desire can be withstood by no one '' then enkidu whose heart was beginning to know about itself and longed for a companion cried aloud '' take me to uruk the city of gilgamesh whose aura and power can not be withstood i will cry out in uruk challenging him 'it is i enkidu the strength of the wild man born in the wilderness can not be withstood `` the temple prostitute replied `` come then to uruk where the processions are and music and let us go together through the dancing to the palace hall where gilgamesh presides the favorite of the gods the beautiful strongest of all the terror the most desired look at his radiant face the favorite of shamash and enlil ea and anu while you were grazing beastlike with gazelles before your mind had any understanding his mind a gift to the gifted of the gods had a dream of you before you knew of him in the early morning gilgamesh arose and told his mother his dream 'i had a dream a star fell from the heavens a meteorite and lay on the empty plain outside uruk the men and women came and wondered at it i strove with it to lift it but could not i was drawn to it as if it was a woman all-knowing rimat-ninsun spoke to him the lord of uruk gilgamesh his mother all-knowing rimat-ninsun spoke and said '' the star that fell from the heavens the meteorite that lay on the empty plain outside uruk the star you could not lift when you strove with it the star you were drawn to as if drawn to a woman is the strong companion powerful as a star the meteorite of the heavens a gift of the gods that you were drawn to it as if drawn to a woman means that this companion will not forsake you he will protect and guard you with his life this is the fortunate meaning of your dream then gilgamesh the lord of uruk said 'may the dream as you interpret come to pass `` the temple prostitute thus told the tale
jutland 1916 not in the thick of the fight not in the press of the odds do the heroes come to their height or we know the demi-gods that stands over till peace we can only perceive men returned from the seas very grateful for leave they grant us sudden days snatched from their business of war but we are too close to appraise what manner of men they are and whether their names go down with age-kept victories or whether they battle and drown unreckoned is hid from our eyes they are too near to be great but our children shall understand when and how our fate was changed and by whose hand our children shall measure their worth we are content to be blind but we know that we walk on a new-born earth with the saviours of mankind
`` and then there were three whereas before there had been four or two and then there were four or two '' thus spake the king no one dared ask what it meant he seemed satisfied by the beauty of the logic that had arrived the royal hall now lightly radiant as he arose from his throne and the world fell away courtiers battlements and clouds and he rose like a piece of paper on which his effigy had been traced in dotted lines whose dots came loose and flew away to a place in history where nothing mattered and then there was one
was helen stronger than achilles even `` as the arrows fell '' that could not be but he recognised in her some power other than her legendary beauty he could name helena but the other he could not name she was a lure a light an intimate flame a secret kept even from his slaves the elect the innermost hierarchy only helena could be named and she was a public scandal in any case a cause of shame to agamemnon and menelaus it was not that she was beautiful true she stood on the walls taut and indifferent as the arrows fell it was not that she was beautiful there were others in spite of the legend as gracious as tall it was not that she was beautiful but he stared and stared across the charred wood and the smouldering flame till his eyes cleared and the smoke drifted away
helen achieves the difficult task of translating a symbol in time into timeless-time or hieroglyph or ancient egyptian time she knows the script she says but we judge that this is intuitive or emotional knowledge rather than intellectual in any case a night-bird swooped toward them in their first encounter on the beach to achilles lately arrived from troy and the carnage of battle this is a `` carrion creature '' but helen would banish these memories she says she is `` instructed '' she is enchanted rather for from the depth of her racial inheritance she invokes as the perceptive visitor to egypt must always do the symbol or the `` letter '' that represents or recalls the protective mother-goddess this is no death-symbol but a life-symbol it is isis or her greek counterpart thetis the mother of achilles we huddled over the fire was there ever such a brazier a night-bird hooted past he started `` a curious flight a carrion creature — what— '' dear god let him forget i said `` there is mystery in this place i am instructed i know the script the shape of this bird is a letter they call it the hieroglyph strive not it is dedicate to the goddess here she is isis '' `` isis '' he said `` or thetis '' i said recalling remembering invoking his sea-mother flame i prayed flame forget forgive and forget the other let my heart be filled with peace let me love him as thetis his mother for i knew him i saw in his eyes the sea-enchantment but he knew not yet helen of sparta knew not helen of troy knew not helena hated of greece
she is afraid too so she needs this protection she has tried to conceal her identity with mockery `` i am a woman of pleasure '' she knows what the greeks think of her and here is greece-incarnate the hero-god true he is shipwrecked nevertheless though wounded he carries with him the threat of autocracy she has lost caste he is still achilles or who is she she says that helen upon the ramparts was a phantom then what is this helen are they both ghosts and if she is convinced of this why does she entreat the flame that achilles kindled `` let me love him as thetis his mother '' is she afraid of losing even her phantom integrity and what of it thetis — isis — aphrodite — it was not her fault o—no—but through eternity she will be blamed for this and she feels it coming she will blacken her face like the prophetic femme noire of antiquity but it does not work achilles is here to impeach her why we must blame someone hecate—a witch —a vulture and finally as if he had run out of common invective he taunts her — a hieroglyph this is almost funny she must stop him he is after all the son of the sea-goddess she has named isis the egyptian aphrodite the primal cause of all the madness but another born-of-the-sea is nearer his own mother again she thinks of her and reminds achilles of his divine origin `` o child of thetis '' this is quite enough can you throttle a phantom he tries the end is inevitable how could i hide my eyes how could i veil my face with ash or charcoal from the embers i drew out a blackened stick but he snatched it he flung it back `` what sort of enchantment is this what art will you wield with a fagot are you hecate are you a witch a vulture a hieroglyph the sign or the name of a goddess what sort of goddess is this where are we who are you where is this desolate coast who am i am i a ghost '' `` you are living o child of thetis as you never lived before '' then he caught at my wrist `` helena cursed of greece i have seen you upon the ramparts no art is beneath your power you stole the chosen the flower of all-time of all-history my children my legions for you were the ships burnt o cursèd o envious isis you — you — a vulture a hieroglyph '' `` zeus be my witness '' i said `` it was he amen dreamed of all this phantasmagoria of troy it was dream and a phantasy '' o thetis o sea-mother i prayed as he clutched my throat with his fingers remorseless steel let me go out let me forget let me be lost o thetis o sea-mother i prayed under his cloak let me remember let me remember forever this star in the night

at dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun in the wild purple of the glow'ring sun smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud the menacing scarred slope and one by one tanks creep and topple forward to the wire the barrage roars and lifts then clumsily bowed with bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire lines of grey muttering faces masked with fear they leave their trenches going over the top while time ticks blank and busy on their wrists and hope with furtive eyes and grappling fists flounders in mud o jesus make it stop
god said “ men have forgotten me the souls that sleep shall wake again and blinded eyes must learn to see. ” so since redemption comes through pain he smote the earth with chastening rod and brought destruction 's lurid reign but where his desolation trod the people in their agony despairing cried “ there is no god ”

i have a rendezvous with death at some disputed barricade when spring comes back with rustling shade and apple-blossoms fill the air— i have a rendezvous with death when spring brings back blue days and fair it may be he shall take my hand and lead me into his dark land and close my eyes and quench my breath— it may be i shall pass him still i have a rendezvous with death on some scarred slope of battered hill when spring comes round again this year and the first meadow-flowers appear god knows 'twere better to be deep pillowed in silk and scented down where love throbs out in blissful sleep pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath where hushed awakenings are dear ... but i 've a rendezvous with death at midnight in some flaming town when spring trips north again this year and i to my pledged word am true i shall not fail that rendezvous

o living pictures of the dead o songs without a sound o fellowship whose phantom tread hallows a phantom ground— how in a gleam have these revealed the faith we had not found we have sought god in a cloudy heaven we have passed by god on earth his seven sins and his sorrows seven his wayworn mood and mirth like a ragged cloak have hid from us the secret of his birth brother of men when now i see the lads go forth in line thou knowest my heart is hungry in me as for thy bread and wine thou knowest my heart is bowed in me to take their death for mine

there is something in the sound of drum and fife that stirs all the savage instincts into life in the old times of peace we went our ways through proper days of little joys and tasks lonely at times when from the steeple sounded wedding chimes telling to all the world some maid was wife— but taking patiently our part in life as it was portioned us by church and state believing it our fate our thoughts all chaste held yet a secret wish to love and mate ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste but men we criticised for lack of strength and kept them at arm 's length then the war came— the world was all aflame the men we had thought dull and void of power were heroes in an hour he who had seemed a slave to petty greed showed masterful in that great time of need he who had plotted for his neighbour 's pelf now for his fellows offers up himself and we were only women forced by war to sacrifice the things worth living for something within us broke something within us woke the wild cave-woman spoke when we heard the sound of drumming as our soldiers went to camp heard them tramp tramp tramp as we watched to see them coming and they looked at us and smiled yes looked back at us and smiled as they filed along by hillock and by hollow then our hearts were so beguiled that for many and many a day we dreamed we heard them say 'oh follow follow follow and the distant rolling drum called us 'come come come till our virtue seemed a thing to give away war had swept ten thousand years away from earth we were primal once again there were males not modern men we were females meant to bring their sons to birth and we could not wait for any formal rite we could hear them calling to us 'come to-night for to-morrow at the dawn we move on and the drum bellowed 'come come come and the fife whistled 'life life life so they moved on and fought and bled and died honoured and mourned they are the nation 's pride we fought our battles too but with the tide of our red blood we gave the world new lives because we were not wives we are dishonoured is it noble then to break god 's laws only by killing men to save one 's country from destruction we took no man 's life but gave our chastity and sinned the ancient sin to plant young trees and fill felled forests in oh clergy of the land bible in hand all reverently you stand on holy thoughts intent while barren wives receive the sacrament had you the open visions you could see phantoms of infants murdered in the womb who never knew a cradle or a tomb hovering about these wives accusingly bestow the sacrament their sins are not well known— ours to the four winds of the earth are blown
last night rain fell over the scarred plateau and now from the dark horizon dazzling flies arrow on fire-plumed arrow to the skies shot from the bright arc of apollo 's bow and from the wild and writhen waste below from flashing pools and mounds lit one by one o is it mist or are these companies of morning heroes who arise arise with thrusting arms with limbs and hair aglow toward the risen god upon whose brow burns the gold laurel of all victories hero and hero 's god th invincible sun
i gloom an october like november august a hundred thousand hours and all september a hundred thousand dragging sunlit days and half october like a thousand years and doom that then was antwerp in the name of god how could they do it those souls that usually dived into the dirty caverns of mines who usually hived in whitened hovels under ragged poplars who dragged muddy shovels over the grassy mud lumbering to work over the greasy sods those men there with the appearance of clods were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of god ever shrived and it is not for us to make them an anthem if we found words there would come no wind that would fan them to a tune that the trumpets might blow it shrill through the heaven that 's ours or yet allah 's or the wide halls of any valhallas we can make no such anthem so that all that is ours for inditing in sonnets pantoums elegiacs or lays is this “ in the name of god how could they do it ” ii for there is no new thing under the sun only this uncomely man with a smoking gun in the gloom what the devil will he gain by it digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it waiting his doom the sharp blow the swift outpouring of the blood till the trench of gray mud is turned to a brown purple drain by it well there have been scars won in many wars punic lacedæmonian wars of napoleon wars for faith wars for honour for love for possession but this belgian man in his ugly tunic his ugly round cap shooting on in a sort of obsession overspreading his miserable land standing with his wet gun in his hand doom he finds that in a sudden scrimmage and lies an unsightly lump on the sodden grass an image that shall take long to pass iii for the white-limbed heroes of hellas ride by upon their horses forever through our brains the heroes of cressy ride by upon their stallions and battalions and battalions and battalions— the old guard the young guard the men of minden and of waterloo pass for ever staunch stand for ever true and the small man with the large paunch and the gray coat and the large hat and the hands behind the back watches them pass in our minds for ever but that clutter of sodden corses on the sodden belgian grass— that is a strange new beauty iv with no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty assuredly that is the way of it the way of beauty and that is the highest word you can find to say of it for you can not praise it with words compounded of lyres and swords but the thought of the gloom and the rain and the ugly coated figure standing beside a drain shall eat itself into your brain and you will say of all heroes “ they fought like the belgians ” and you will say “ he wrought like a belgian his fate out of gloom. ” and you will say “ he bought like a belgian his doom. ” and that shall be an honourable name “ belgian ” shall be an honourable word as honourable as the fame of the sword as honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre and his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in tyre v and what in the world did they bear it for i do n't know and what in the world did they dare it for perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand they could very well have watched a hundred legions go over their fields and between their cities down into more southerly regions they could very well have let the legions pass through their woods and have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods i do n't understand was it just love of their land oh poor dears can any man so love his land give them a thousand thousand pities and rivers and rivers of tears to wash off the blood from the cities of flanders vi this is charing cross it is midnight there is a great crowd and no light a great crowd all black that hardly whispers aloud surely that is a dead woman—a dead mother she has a dead face she is dressed all in black she wanders to the bookstall and back at the back of the crowd and back again and again back she sways and wanders this is charing cross it is one o'clock there is still a great cloud and very little light immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd that hardly whispers aloud and now that is another dead mother and there is another and another and another and little children all in black all with dead faces waiting in all the waiting-places wandering from the doors of the waiting-room in the dim gloom these are the women of flanders they await the lost they await the lost that shall never leave the dock they await the lost that shall never again come by the train to the embraces of all these women with dead faces they await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss in the dark of the night this is charing cross it is past one of the clock there is very little light there is so much pain l ’ envoi and it was for this that they endured this gloom this october like november that august like a hundred thousand hours and that september a hundred thousand dragging sunlit days and half october like a thousand years oh poor dears
hindenburg line april 1917 groping along the tunnel step by step he winked his prying torch with patching glare from side to side and sniffed the unwholesome air tins boxes bottles shapes and too vague to know a mirror smashed the mattress from a bed and he exploring fifty feet below the rosy gloom of battle overhead tripping he grabbed the wall saw someone lie humped at his feet half-hidden by a rug and stooped to give the sleeper ’ s arm a tug “ i ’ m looking for headquarters. ” no reply “ god blast your neck ” for days he ’ d had no sleep “ get up and guide me through this stinking place. ” savage he kicked a soft unanswering heap and flashed his beam across the livid face terribly glaring up whose eyes yet wore agony dying hard of ten days before and fists of fingers clutched a blackening wound alone he staggered on until he found dawn 's ghost that filtered down a shafted stair to the dazed muttering creatures underground who hear the boom of shells in muffled sound at last with sweat and horror in his hair he climbed through darkness to the twilight air unloading hell behind him step by step
i love roads the goddesses that dwell far along invisible are my favorite gods roads go on while we forget and are forgotten like a star that shoots and is gone on this earth 't is sure we men have not made anything that doth fade so soon so long endure the hill road wet with rain in the sun would not gleam like a winding stream if we trod it not again they are lonely while we sleep lonelier for lack of the traveller who is now a dream only from dawn 's twilight and all the clouds like sheep on the mountains of sleep they wind into the night the next turn may reveal heaven upon the crest the close pine clump at rest ancl black may hell conceal often footsore never yet of the road i weary though long and steep and dreary as it winds on for ever helen of the roads the mountain ways of wales and the mabinogion tales is one of the true gods abiding in the trees the threes and fours so wise the larger companies that by the roadside be and beneath the rafter else uninhabited excepting by the dead and it is her laughter at morn and night i hear when the thrush cock sings bright irrelevant things and when the chanticleer calls back to their own night troops that make loneliness with their light footsteps ’ press as helen ’ s own are light now all roads lead to france and heavy is the tread of the living but the dead returning lightly dance whatever the road bring to me or take from me they keep me company with their pattering crowding the solitude of the loops over the downs hushing the roar of towns and their brief multitude
the anguish of the earth absolves our eyes till beauty shines in all that we can see war is our scourge yet war has made us wise and fighting for our freedom we are free horror of wounds and anger at the foe and loss of things desired all these must pass we are the happy legion for we know time 's but a golden wind that shakes the grass there was an hour when we were loth to part from life we longed to share no less than others now having claimed this heritage of heart what need we more my comrades and my brothers
as i went up by ovillers in mud and water cold to the knee there went three jeering fleering spectres that walked abreast and talked of me the first said ‘ here ’ s a right brave soldier that walks the dark unfearingly soon he ’ ll come back on a fine stretcher and laughing for a nice blighty. ’ the second ‘ read his face old comrade no kind of lucky chance i see one day he ’ ll freeze in mud to the marrow then look his last on picardie. ’ though bitter the word of these first twain curses the third spat venomously ‘ he ’ ll stay untouched till the war ’ s last dawning then live one hour of agony. ’ liars the first two were behold me at sloping arms by one – two – three waiting the time i shall discover whether the third spake verity
not a sign of life we rouse in any square close-shuttered house that flanks the road we amble down toward far trenches through the town the dark snow-slushy empty street ... tingle of frost in brow and feet ... horse-breath goes dimly up like smoke no sound but the smacking stroke of a sergeant flings each arm out and across to keep him warm and the sudden splashing crack of ice-pools broken by our track more dark houses yet no sign of life ... an axle ’ s creak and whine ... the splash of hooves the strain of trace ... clatter we cross the market place deep quiet again and on we lurch under the shadow of a church its tower ascends fog-wreathed and grim within its aisles a light burns dim ... when marvellous from overhead like abrupt speech of one deemed dead speech-moved by some superior will a bell tolls thrice and then is still and suddenly i know that now the priest within with shining brow lifts high the small round of the host the server ’ s tingling bell is lost in clash of the greater overhead peace like a wave descends is spread while watch the peasants ’ reverent eyes ... the bell ’ s boom trembles hangs and dies o people who bow down to see the miracle of calvary the bitter and the glorious bow down bow down and pray for us once more our anguished way we take toward our golgotha to make for all our lovers sacrifice again the troubled bell tolls thrice and slowly slowly lifted up dazzles the overflowing cup o worshipping fond multitude remember us too and our blood turn hearts to us as we go by salute those about to die plead for them the deep bell toll their sacrifice must soon be whole entreat you for such hearts as break with the premonitory ache of bodies whose feet hands and side must soon be torn pierced crucified sue for them and all of us who the world over suffer thus who have scarce time for prayer indeed who only march and die and bleed the town is left the road leads on bluely glaring in the sun toward where in the sunrise gate death honour and fierce battle wait
i strayed about the deck an hour to-night under a cloudy moonless sky and peeped in at the windows watched my friends at table or playing cards or standing in the doorway or coming out into the darkness still no one could see me i would have thought of them —heedless within a week of battle—in pity pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness and link ’ d beauty of bodies and pity that this gay machine of splendour ’ ld soon be broken thought little of pashed scattered … only always i could but see them—against the lamplight—pass like coloured shadows thinner than filmy glass slight bubbles fainter than the wave ’ s faint light that broke to phosphorus out in the night perishing things and strange ghosts—soon to die to other ghosts—this one or that or i
she was a village of lovely knowledge the high roads left her aside she was forlorn a maid — water ran there dusk hid her she climbed four-wayed brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep water ran was a centre of silence deep fathomless deeps of pricked sky almost fathomless hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue and i was happy indeed of mind soul body even having got given a sign undoubtful of a dear england few doubt not many have seen that will squele he knew and was so shriven home of twelfth night — edward thomas by arras fallen borrow and hardy sussex tales out of roman heights callen no madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim till i got back i was dumb
my eyes catch ruddy necks sturdily pressed back all a red-brick moving glint like flaming pendulums hands swing across the khaki— mustard coloured khaki— to the automatic feet we husband the ancient glory in these bared necks and hands not broke is the forge of mars but a subtler brain beats iron to shoe the hoofs of death who pays dynamic air now — blind fingers loose an iron cloud to rain immortal darkness on strong eyes
fighting in mud we turn to thee in these dread times of battle lord to keep us safe if so may be from shrapnel snipers shell and sword but not on us for we are men of meaner clay who fight in clay but on the staff the upper ten depends the issue of the day the staff is working with its brains while we are sitting in the trench the staff the universe ordains subject to thee and general french god help the staff-especially the young ones many of them sprung from our high aristocracy their task is hard and they are young o lord who mad'st all things to be and madest some things very good please keep the extra a.d.c from horrid scenes and sight of blood see that his eggs are newly laid not tinged as some of them-with green and let no nasty draughts invade the windows of his limousine when he forgets to buy the bread when there are no more minerals preserve his smooth well-oiled head from wrath of caustic generals o lord who mad'st all things to be and hatest nothing thou has made please keep the extra a.d.c out of the sun and in the shade
if it were not for england who would bear this heavy servitude one moment more to keep a brothel sweep and wash the floor of filthiest hovels were noble to compare with this brass-cleaning life now here now there harried in foolishness scanned curiously o'er by fools made brazen by conceit and store of antique witticisms thin and bare only the love of comrades sweetens all whose laughing spirit will not be outdone as night-watching men wait for the sun to hearten them so wait i on such boys as neither brass nor hell-fire may appal nor guns nor sergeant-major 's bluster and noise
i love you great new titan am i not you napoleon and caesar out of you grew out of unthinkable torture eyes kissed by death won back to the world again lost and won in a breath cruel men are made immortal out of your pain born they have stolen the sun 's power with their feet on your shoulders worn let them shrink from your girth that has outgrown the pallid days when you slept like circe 's swine or a word in the brain 's ways
only the wanderer knows england 's graces or can anew see clear familiar faces and who loves joy as he that dwells in shadows do not forget me quite o severn meadows
little did i dream england that you bore me under the cotswold hills beside the water meadows to do you dreadful service here beyond your borders and your enfolding seas i was a dreamer ever and bound to your dear service meditating deep i thought on your secret beauty as through a child 's face one may see the clear spirit miraculously shining your hills not only hills but friends of mine and kindly your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river muddy and strongly flowing with shy and tiny streamlets safe in its bosom now these are memories only and your skies and rushy sky-pools fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ... but deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being and uses consecrate think on me too o mother who wrest my soul to serve you in strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters none but you can know my heart its tears and sacrifice none but you repay
now youth the hour of thy dread passion comes thy lovely things must all be laid away and thou as others must face the riven day unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums or bugles strident cry when mere noise numbs the sense of being the sick soul doth sway remember thy great craft 's honour that they may say nothing in shame of poets then the crumbs of praise the little versemen joyed to take shall be forgotten then they must know we are for all our skill in words equal in might and strong of mettle as those we honoured make the name of poet terrible in just war and like a crown of honour upon the fight
when i remember plain heroic strength and shining virtue shown by ypres pools then read the blither written by knaves for fools in praise of english soldiers lying at length who purely dream what england shall be made gloriously new free of the old stains by us who pay the price that must be paid will freeze all winter over ypres plains our silly dreams of peace you put aside and brotherhood of man for you will see an armed mistress braggart of the tide her children slaves under your mastery we 'll have a word there too and forge a knife will cut the cancer threatens england 's life

this is no case of petty right or wrong that politicians or philosophers can judge i hate not germans nor grow hot with love of englishmen to please newspapers beside my hate for one fat patriot my hatred of the kaiser is love true — a kind of god he is banging a gong but i have not to choose between the two or between justice and injustice dinned with war and argument i read no more than in the storm smoking along the wind athwart the wood two witches cauldrons roar from one the weather shall rise clear and gay out of the other an england beautiful and like her mother that died yesterday little i know or care if being dull i shall miss something that historians can rake out of the ashes when perchance the phoenix broods serene above their ken but with the best and meanest englishmen i am one in crying god save england lest we lose what never slaves and cattle blessed the ages made her that made us from dust she is all we know and live by and we trust she is good and must endure loving her so and as we love ourselves we hate our foe
but this is ambiguous and so i will clarify last night i dreamt of a lake on fire a lovely woman tapered off into a fish i wore an owl mask with the desire to avoid use of his sacred name and then i came to those minced pronunciations like gad and gar and ged and gog and goles and golly and gom and gosh jolly and gud and gum and adad and adod and bedad and begad and ecod and egad and gadzooks and garzoon because gar is only used by playwrights who put it chiefly in the mouths of foreigners you said oh god my god good god followed by a good wish to that god of my ever-closing gaps for i receive god only ghostly that goodly god that guides the globe that god of love that god of war that god that blesses the god-blessed and the god-forsaken and the god-damned my god my shame is on me i said to the painterly painter my god my shame 's inside me and must go forth my body this beastbody this dogsbody this stony and bony bodykins that my god has plunged my soul into last night i hung from the vine from the branch from the noose until the sun stopped and the moon stood still until my nation took vengeance upon my enemies last night a piece of cake tumbled into our city and struck our walls until they fell then it rolled around and around until the entire city turned upside down meanwhile back at the lake i lapped silver water until dirt came out of my wounds until dirt came out of my mouth then i killed my lover montgomery in a new scatological satire last night nature ran hastily into its din enthusiastically into its prison wallowing in the flood of its patterning and randomness bedlam elected himself umpire and stood quickly in the midst of it arranging and disarranging the very laws of nature the earth vessel itself he plunged into the green and uneven horizon and all at once we entered a whole new world in the beginning the heavens and earth rose in the beginning we gave birth to the tiniest of errors in the beginning we watch for the rest of eternity as it blossoms and it blooms
love of air and water joined in apprehension perhaps you know what 's there by way of fear for while living in pursuit of and going always forth toward something that trembles its knowledge is your mind what do you think about the great ocean 's sullen aristocrats—these small headaches and dark affairs that bathe themselves in your staging grounds where you go to contemplate how what you want became your mind the black oblivion offers no reprieve for you hunter—in its keep your ears have grown too sharp so sharp you almost hear your own heartbeat over the subtle whispers of water ’ s dismal gardens everything about you is overblown even your mouth is uniquely talented at its tasks gathering for slaughter animals in their sleep speaking without a sound noah had seven laws you have only one—eat to build life out of death survive above all things the fatalistic moon filtered down upon you seems an imitation of lives you will not live would you be its hero would you call out against the morning ’ s weaving light that shames the night before the passing of its cool would you be at the beach when the invisible becomes a glow to surprise inland workers dreaming of unitarian proposals lose no sleep to fear about your mouth it is their wayward friends who wandered too far west into fevered chaos that wake up with your name as screams exploding dreams the inland ether holds clouds in your dismal shape lucky are those who know nothing who can not see hell outlined in vapor somewhere a piano plays a sorrowful song half-written by the hate that a grieving loved one would stick into your heart such are the arts of men beware your time is near someone has learned lessons you didn ’ t mean to teach a crowd is gathering your skull is their kingdom
i. children 's arms on my way home i pass a cameraman on a platform on the bumper of a car inside which rolling and plunging a comedian is working on one white lot i see a star stumble to her igloo through the howling gale of the wind machines on melrose a dinosaur and pterodactyl with their immense pale papier-mâché smiles look over the fence of the lost world whispering to myself the tale these shout—done with my schoolwork i commence my real life my arsenal my workshop opens and in impotent omnipotence i put on the helmet and the breastplate pop cut out and soldered for me here is the shield i sawed from beaver board and painted here on top the bow that only odysseus can wield and eleven vermilion-ringed goose-feathered arrows the twelfth was broken on the battlefield when searching among snap beans and potatoes i stepped on it some dry weeds a dead cane are my spears the knife on the bureau's my throwing-knife the small unpainted biplane without wheels—that so often helped by human hands has taken off from landed on the counterpane— is my spad o dead list that misunderstands and laughs at and lies about the new live wild loves it lists that sets upright in the sands of age in which nothing grows where all our friends are old a few dried leaves marked this is the greenwood— o arms that arm for a child 's wars the child and yet they are good if anything is good against his enemies across the seas at the bottom of the world where childhood sits on its desert island with achilles and pitamakan the white blackfoot in the black auditorium my heart at ease i watch the furred castaways the seniors put a play on every spring tame their wild beasts erect their tree house chatting over their fruit their coconuts they relish their stately feasts the family 's servant their magnanimous master now rules them by right nature 's priests they worship at nature 's altar when with decorous affection the admirable crichton kisses a girl like a big wendy all of us squirm or sit up in our seats undone when an english sail is sighted the prisoners escape from their eden to the world the real one where servants are servants masters masters and no one 's magnanimous the lights go on and we go off robbed of our fruit our furs— the island that the children ran is gone the island sang to me believe believe and did n't i know a lady with a lion each evening as the sun sank did n't i grieve to leave my tree house for reality there was nothing there for me to disbelieve at peace among my weapons i sit in my tree and feel friday night then saturday then sunday i 'm dreaming of a wolf as mama wakes me and a tall girl who is–outside it 's gray i ca n't remember i jump up and dress we eat in the lighted kitchen and what is play for me for them is habit happiness is a quiet presence breathless and familiar my grandfather and i sit there in oneness as the sunset bus lit by the lavender and rose of sunrise takes us to the dark echoing cavern where pop a worker works for our living as he rules a mark a short square pencil in his short square hand on a great sheet of copper i make some remark he does n't hear in that hard maze—in that land that grown men live in—in the world of work he measures shears solders and i stand empty-handed watching him i wander into the murk the naked light bulbs pierce the workmen making something say something to the boy in his white shirt i jerk as the sparks fly at me the man hammering as acid hisses and the solder turns to silver seems to me a dwarf hammering out the ring in the world under the world the hours blur bored and not bored i bend things out of lead i wash my smudged hands as my grandfather washes his black ones with their gritty soap ahead past their time clock their pay window is the blue and gold and white of noon the sooty thread up which the laborers feel their way into their wives and houses is money the fact of life the secret the grown-ups share is what to do to make money the husband adam eve his wife have learned how not to have to do without till santa claus brings them their boy scout knife— nor do they find things in dreams carry a paper route sell christmas seals starting his saturday his sunday pop tells me what i love to hear about his boyhood in shelbyville i play what he plays hunt what he hunts remember what he remembers it seems to me i could stay in that dark forest lit by one fading ember of his campfire forever but we 're home i run in love to each familiar member of this little state clustered about the dome of st. nicholas—this city in which my rabbit depends on me and i on everyone—this first rome of childhood so absolute in every habit that when we hear the world our jailor say '' tell me art thou a roman '' the time we inhabit drops from our shoulders and we answer `` yea i stand at caesar 's judgment seat i appeal unto caesar '' i wash my hands pop gives his pay envelope to mama we sit down to our meal the phone rings mrs. mercer wonders if i 'd care to go to the library that would be ideal i say when mama lets me i comb my hair and find the four books i have out the food of the gods was best liking that world where the children eat and grow giant and good i swear as i 've often sworn `` i 'll never forget what it 's like when i 've grown up '' a prelude by chopin hammered note by note like alphabet blocks comes from next door it 's played with real feeling the feeling of being indoors practicing `` and yet it 's not as if— '' a gray electric stealing to the curb on silent wheels has come and i see on the back seat sight more appealing than any human sight my own friend lucky half wolf half police-dog and he can play the piano— play that he does that is—and jump so high for a ball that he turns a somersault `` hello '' i say to the lady and hug lucky in my talk with the world in which it tells me what i know and i tell it `` i know— '' how strange that i know nothing and yet it tells me what i know — i appreciate the animals who stand by purring or else they sit and pant it 's so— so agreeable if only people purred and panted so now lucky and i sit in our row mrs. mercer in hers i take for granted the tiller by which she steers the yellow roses in the bud vases the whole enchanted drawing room of our progress the glass encloses as glass does a womanish and childish and doggish universe we press our noses to the glass and wish the angel- and devilfish floating by on vine on sunset shut their eyes and press their noses to their glass and wish ii a night with lions when i was twelve we 'd visit my aunt 's friend who owned a lion the metro-goldwyn-mayer lion i 'd play with him and he 'd pretend to play with me i was the real player but he 'd trot back and forth inside his cage till he got bored i put tawny in the prayer i did n't believe in not at my age but said still just as i did everything in fours and gave to something on the average one cookie out of three and by my quartz my ores my wood with the bark on it from the petrified forest i put his dewclaw now the lion roars his slow comfortable roars i lie beside my young tall brown aunt out there in the past or future and i sleepily confide my dream-discovery my breath comes fast whenever i see someone with your skin hear someone with your voice the lion 's steadfast roar goes on in the darkness i have been asleep a while when i remember you are—you and tawny was the lion in— in tarzan in tarzan just as we used to i talk to you you talk to me or pretend to talk to me as grown-up people do of jurgen and rupert hughes till in the end i think as a child thinks `` you 're my real friend '' iii a street off sunset sometimes as i drive by the factory that manufactures after so long vicks vaporub ointment there rises over me a eucalyptus tree i feel its stair-sticks impressed on my palms my insteps as i climb to my tree house the gray leaves make me mix my coughing chest anointed at bedtime with the smell of the sap trickling from the tan trunk where the nails go in my lifetime got rid of i sit in a dark blue sedan beside my great-grandmother in hollywood we pass a windmill a pink sphinx an allbran billboard thinking of salâmmbo robin hood the old prospector with his flapjack in the air i sit with my hands folded i am good that night as i lie crossways in an armchair reading amazing stories just as long before i 'd lie by my rich uncle 's polar bear on his domed library 's reflecting floor in the last year of the first world war and see a poor two-seater being attacked by four triplanes on the cover of the literary digest and a camel coming to its aid i 'd feel the bear 's fur warm and rough against me the colors of the afternoon would fade i 'd reach into the bear 's mouth and hold tight to its front tooth and think `` i 'm not afraid '' there off sunset in the lamplit starlight a scientist is getting ready to destroy the world `` it 's time for you to say good night '' mama tells me i go on in breathless joy `` remember tomorrow is a school day '' mama tells me i go on in breathless joy at last i go to mama in her gray silk to pop to dandeen in her black silk i put my arms around them they put their arms around me then i go back to my bedroom i read as i undress the scientist is ready to attack mama calls `` is your light out '' i call back `` yes '' and turn the light out forced out of life into bed for a moment i lie comfortless in the blank darkness then as i always do i put on the earphones of the crystal set— each bed has its earphones—and the uneasy tissue of their far-off star-sound of the blue-violet of space surrounds the sweet voice from the tabernacle of the four-square gospel a vague marionette tall auburn holds her arms out to unshackle the bonds of sin of sleep—as next instant the sun holds its arms out through the fig the lemon tree in the back yard the clucking hens all cackle as mama brings their chicken feed i see my magazine my magazine dressing for school i read how the good world wins its victory over that bad man books book strap jump the footstool you made in manual training then we three sit down and one says grace and then by rule by that habit that moves the stars some coffee— one spoonful—is poured out into my milk and the milk transubstantiated is coffee and mama 's weekday wash-dress dandeen 's soft black silk are ways that habit itself makes holy just as on sunday mornings wednesday nights his will comes in their ways—of church of prayer meeting—to set free the spirit from the flesh it questions so so unquestioned my own habit moves me to and through and from school like a domino till home i wake to find that i am playing dominoes with dandeen her old face is slow in pleasure slow in doubt as she sits weighing strategies patient equable and humble she hears what this last child of hers is saying in pride or bewilderment and she will grumble like a child or animal when indifferent to the reasons of my better self i mumble '' i 'd better stop now—the rabbit '' i relent and play her one more game it is miraculous to have a great-grandmother i feel different from others as between moves we discuss the war between the states the cheerful troops ride up to our farmhouse steal from us the spoons the horses—when their captain stoops to dandeen and puts dandeen on his horse she cries as i run by the chicken coops with lettuce for my rabbit real remorse hurts me here now the little girl is crying because i did n't write because— of course i was a child i missed them so but justifying hurts too if only i could play you one more game see you all one more time i think of you dying forgiving me—or not it is all the same to the forgiven my rabbit 's glad to see me he scrambles to me gives me little tame bites before he eats the lettuce his furry long warm soft floppy ears his crinkling nose are reassuring to a child they guarantee as so much here does that the child knows who takes care of him whom he takes care of mama comes out and takes in the clothes from the clothesline she looks with righteous love at all of us her spare face half a girl 's she enters a chicken coop and the hens shove and flap and squawk in fear the whole flock whirls into the farthest corner she chooses one comes out and wrings its neck the body hurls itself out—lunging reeling it begins to run away from something to fly away from something in great flopping circles mama stands like a nun in the center of each awful anguished ring the thudding and scrambling go on go on—then they fade i open my eyes it 's over could such a thing happen to anything it could to a rabbit i 'm afraid it could to— `` mama you wo n't kill reddy ever you wo n't ever will you '' the farm woman tries to persuade the little boy her grandson that she 'd never kill the boy 's rabbit never even think of it he would like to believe her and whenever i see her there in that dark infinite standing like judith with the hen 's head in her hand i explain it away in vain—a hypocrite like all who love into the blue wonderland of hollywood the sun sinks past the eucalyptus the sphinx the windmill and i watch and read and hold my story tight and when the bus stops at the corner and pop—pop —steps down and i run out to meet him a blurred nimbus half-red half-gold enchants his sober brown face his stooped shoulders into the all-father 's he tells me about the work he 's done downtown we sit there on the steps my universe mended almost i tell him about the scientist i say '' he could n't really could he pop '' my comforter's eyes light up and he laughs `` no that 's just play just make-believe '' he says the sky is gray we sit there at the end of our good day
that sail which leans on light tired of islands a schooner beating up the caribbean for home could be odysseus home-bound on the aegean that father and husband's longing under gnarled sour grapes is like the adulterer hearing nausicaa 's name in every gull 's outcry this brings nobody peace the ancient war between obsession and responsibility will never finish and has been the same for the sea-wanderer or the one on shore now wriggling on his sandals to walk home since troy sighed its last flame and the blind giant 's boulder heaved the trough from whose groundswell the great hexameters come to the conclusions of exhausted surf the classics can console but not enough
jamestown 1957 it kissed us soft to cut our throats this coast like a malice of the lazy king i hunt hunt but find here what to kill —nothing is blunt but phantoming uneases i find ghost on ghost precedes of all most scared us most we fled howls fail upon this secret far air grunt shaming for food you must i love the king it was not i who strangled at the toast but a flux of a free dying adjutant god be with him he god be with us all for we are not to live i can not wring like laundry blue my soul—indecisive thing from undergrowth over odd birds call and who would starv 'd so survive god save the king

it 's the ragged source of memory a tarpaper-shingled bungalow whose floors tilt toward the porch whose back yard ends abruptly in a weedy ravine nothing special a chain of three bedrooms and a long side porch turned parlor where my great-grandfather pomp smoked every evening over the news a long sunny kitchen where annie his wife measured cornmeal dreaming through the window across the ravine and up to shelby hill where she had borne their spirited high-yellow brood in the middle bedroom 's hard high antique double bed the ghost of aunt jane the laundress who bought the house in 1872 though i call with all my voices does not appear nor does pomp 's ghost with whom one of my cousins believes she once had a long and intimate unspoken midnight talk he told her though they 'd never met that he loved her promised her raw widowhood would heal without leaving a scar the conveniences in an enclosed corner of the slant-floored back side porch were the first indoor plumbing in town aunt jane put them in incurring the wrath of the woman who lived in the big house next door aunt jane left the house to annie whose mother she had known as a slave on the plantation so annie and pomp could move their children into town down off shelby hill my grandmother her brother and five sisters watched their faces change slowly in the oval mirror on the wall outside the door into teachers faces golden with respect here geneva the randy sister damned their colleges daubing her quicksilver breasts with gifts of perfume as much as love as much as a visit to the grave of a known ancestor the homeplace moves me not to silence but to righteous praise jesus song oh catfish and turnip greens hot-water cornbread and grits oh musty much-underlined bibles generations lost to be found to be found
in the next room peter ’ s gloved hands crack cordoned-off spines he has been granted permission his agent ’ s call his pedigree so the tour itself is only the docent and me he is docile eager to please leads me up the stairs and takes me to the bed the coverlet is authentic he says he lectures me on the heating system offers an anecdote of a broken casserole recites all of the welty lore he has rehearsed she taught him when he was young and now he serves her legend lets me lean in toward the books—i cross the line of what ’ s allowed never touching he shows me photos—two loves lost one a married man—then on the way down pauses before a feather in a box reciting yeats ’ s “ leda and the swan. ” he begins to weep at let her drop adds like welty ’ s loves now i stop— is he comparing her to the god or leda he can not bear her her unfulfilled love i can not bear this either—how dare he conjure up for her such disappointment such wasted longing i want to be the mirror of her photographs to be her figure of my own conjuring i want to believe i too could be happy here in this solitary house in this small town amidst the rows and stacks of books untouched
`` the wild will keep calling and calling forever in your ears you can not escape the 'little voices '' —frank wild 1. here i rest in south georgia a few feet of evolution away lie the graves of whale hunters pointing north a white fence shields them from elephant seals and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn of the end of the world or maybe the beginning i survived five expeditions to the pole the one before last “ imperial trans-antarctica ” nearly killed me for two years i put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow these fields and unlike farmers i didn ’ t even need to ask god for rain because ice is sated and more desolate than the sahara i survived distance wrote one message after another beginning with a capital letter and a `` ps '' at the end my own personal post office under my pillow closed for two years already on holiday i survived six month-long polar days and nights to this day i do n't know which one was worse my epitaph is simple carved in granite frank wild 18 april 1873 19 august 1939 “ shackleton ’ s right hand man ” from those cast away here by a defect in the engine of the ship or nostalgia of the womb 2. ah yes in the beginning was the ship the ship stuck in ice endurance ships are women they prefer soft seas in the best-case scenario she ’ s called la santa maria and she throws you like columbus on some foreign shore but if you get too close to her the very day after we washed her deck with warm water and soap warmed her arteries with gin stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces she took off and from the shore we saw how she broke her ribs sinking aft first so fast we didn ’ t even have time to pray leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance and faux pearls on the water “ such a woman ” someone laughed bitterly “ she knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten. ” 3. a woman naturally has no business there antarctica is a masculine continent— male penguins keep the eggs warm the moon stands up on the street to urinate after being kicked out of the tavern the cold like a cut-throat razor dulled for three thousand years and the sled dogs the huskies we kill with a single bullet so they won ’ t starve to death in this way we instill a little character into the new land before the arrival of conquistadors thieves assassins missionaries prostitutes the first invading army of every continent antarctica is a man ’ s continent because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind by conquering the body as amundsen and scott did their glory reaching to the apex of ecstasy zero degree of geographical latitude utter collapse 4. hunger is overestimated the stomach functions much like the brain when it has nothing to think about it feeds off memories it can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit but those who have a better memory meaning a much stronger acidity can go on for months remembering a slice of prosciutto two fried eggs sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal then hallucinations begin banquets easter supper feet move impatiently under the table the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter and two clean serving hands with burns here and there that 's when you feel grief-stricken and you attack the seals and penguins with your alpine knives and shoes like a madman in an empty amphitheater or is this too a hallucination and in this case not ours but antarctica 's and when clarity finally returns both stomach and brain notice only their own deep wrinkles 5. blubber blubber seal 's blubber blubber that keeps your spirits alive rendering it for fuel for light blubber to mask the body 's foul odor —a mixture of doubt hope and ammonia and if you have nothing better to do think of a cow 's thigh hanging at the butcher 's its delicate streak of fat like a silk ribbon i survived even this sarcasm and every night before bed we read recipes to each other one of a few things we secretly rescued from the ship before she sank as if these items were her lingerie what a show it was what pathos in pronouncing prosciutto sugar omelet what sensuality in milk parsley cinnamon we made these words up ourselves nothing exists until its moment of absence but first in order to warm up our mouths like actors before going on stage we 'd repeat mechanically palates dry '' bless us o lord and this food we 've received through your mercy. ” 6. it was the romans who spoiled the word studying rhetoric before anatomy and mathematics vir bonus dicendi peritus “ the good man skilled in speaking '' marcus porcius cato but in antarctica words are measured differently by calories with a simple greeting you lose five calories just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute and a ciceronian argument can consume a whole day ’ s nutrition think carefully before you open your mouth the word is overestimated sometimes it ’ s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes to imply “ gangrene ” and a vague exchange of glances between men is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet and death is closer than your fingers 7. stretched smooth from end to end—such is antarctica in fact even a baby ’ s skin looks withered by comparison no emotions no regrets no warnings either fight or die my father was like this more or less a teacher at a village school in classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers drying on the body and eyes that moved freely in their hollows like toes inside an older sibling ’ s shoes unlike the romans my father preached about justice and honor his hands folded behind his back his shoulders seemed twice as wide as his worn jacket i inherited his sharp gray gaze and his soft voice eyes that say “ go ” and a voice that says “ stay. ” you never know which one to trust 8. and mother oh she was simply captain cook ’ s niece —the great james cook— from morning to night when she washed swept dug potatoes from the garden fixed her husband ’ s tie on sundays even from her bed while in labor she never spoke of this as it wasn ’ t necessary people speak of what they have not what they are she was a tailor measured everyone 's perimeter with a glance erred only on the width of one ’ s neck an unknown strength her large scissors followed the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely `` snip '' she said little her silence followed the white outlines of another tailor over a fabric much older than she was but now that i think of it how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking '' where is your son '' `` he 's exploring the world '' `` and what does he bring back from there '' `` himself alive i hope '' `` what 's the point of returning empty-handed after two years ” was she at least a little proud of me of her frank certainly not she was captain cook 's niece the past always conquers 9. i was the first of thirteen children and as a rule each of them eyed one of my belongings one eyed my bed near the window that overlooked the water where frogs lived and asparagus grew on the shore another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money poker cards a fishing net my wicker chair with the damaged back another whistled my favorite tune '' what will we do with a drunken sailor ” without reaching the refrain and yet another envied the basement —that place i occupied in my father ’ s heart— with its elm door hanging by a single hinge but the time has n't come to leave home just yet until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit and dreams of the same girl 10. what shaving kit antarctica makes you grow a double-beard as if you were a hundred-year-old grave and while you remember wasting time waiting in line at barber's another beard grows a red one here each body part works for itself the stomach hands intestines eyes the unity of the body is overestimated too only skin pulls everything together like a sled the skin which skin man loses his first skin to his first love like the snake early in spring on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way from that point on he stops counting the rest 11. i don ’ t know why it was named “ elephant island ” when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf we could only make out her sly teats under her belly after some time if she didn ’ t kill us first we ’ d begin to cry like wolves ourselves twenty-two people packed next to one another under two inverted boats like notes in bach ’ s “ come sweet death come blessed rest ” with more pauses a dramatic suffocation between breaths a dry calcic cough was a sign of life or the delirious mutterings of someone dreaming aloud of “ ice ” in the middle of ice after they had cut off his toes but the hardest moment arrives in the morning when with shut eyes and plugged nostrils as if drinking your own urine you recycle the same lie for four months straight “ men pack up your stuff the boss might arrive today ” and they obeyed me packed carefully each day from the start leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction it was a time when routine grew more powerful than hope 12. fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship on the seventh mile we left our medals behind class ranks along with the dogs potatoes and a camera we made fire out of money and kept only a single metal coin each so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later on elephant island we had to bid farewell even to tobacco tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways and walks home after midnight time glided above us without touching a single strand of our hair— nonexistent as if gliding above ancient cities exposing the solemnity of our white bones and crickets on absent walls that ’ s when the ten commandments deserted us “ do not steal ” “ do not lie ” “ do not covet ” “ honor your parents ” save one of them perhaps the one about the holiness of sunday we already had nothing we belonged to no one an entirely new species homo antarcticus a scientific proof that “ forgotten ” and “ free ” mean the same thing 13. two years after returning from the world of the dead you find your house taken over by another tenant and the rent tripled the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate “ here lived f.w. ” and your lover or better ex-lover for the same reason in the arms of another three times more handsome you see your own image sold at an auction artifact original “ brrramp sold ” the price so high you can ’ t afford it but even if you could you 're an illegal customer holding a death certificate in your hand and you find your parents turned into winter trees their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster they don ’ t expect visitors best not disturb them let their leaves fall quietly where they will let the crow 's nest remain in the armpit of a branch where it has always been perhaps you should take a shortcut start over or you know what there ’ s a war going on nearby they say go there instead but this time die better 14. war ’ s never satisfied with flesh fresh branded smoked with or without blood blue blood dark thick whatever kind and frozen blood like yours could store at minus 40 degrees celsius viruses from 1914 unscathed and the map of the old empire and scott 's hurt ego and old coins minted with the head of edward vii and browning ’ s poetry and the epic of the unknown like an envelope inside an envelope all making you the ideal candidate back on the ship ammunition everywhere sailing through the cold northern seas where you had to learn a new language a new language is like a fish first you need to remove its spine in order to chew it unlike in antarctica one ’ s purpose in war is clear kill or be killed though sometimes it ’ s the same difference baltic nights gave you what antarctica refused you the other half of the celestial sphere you meet vera the widow of a tea plantation owner a character out of a baroque novel her pupils blurred with dusk and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body like a final journey 15. a man charmed by a glacier who knows too well the flawless forms of her body feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep her clean and distant breath and her heart a piece of ice that melts inside a cigarette case heated for drinking water finds it difficult to marry a real woman to marry vera and africa i bought land barren hundreds of acres in zululand i didn ’ t fare well with tobacco planted cotton instead chose bodily peace rather than meditation my nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away white of course and my fate never blended with the blacks those beautiful statues wrapped in straw i heard them nod off during lunch break like the oars of a boat in complete sync they knew where they were heading but i didn ’ t and i was right it didn ’ t take long before drought floods worms destroyed everything the bank left me only my own beard and the malarial shadow of a baobab apart from other things vera filled out divorce papers the woman in the yellow dress yellow as quinine yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk the woman married to the hero who now can ’ t even manage a small plot of land 16. the man in front of me —my master i call `` boss '' — is newly shaved and dressed in a striped tie and jacket as if the prince of wales or fred astaire a style that arrives here two years late he asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar and chat them up using their jargon gestures sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes and the abstract rhetoric of the depression years and to be frank he pays me for the latter but what do i know what does a survivor know about the art of living for which new instincts are needed new muscles and other kinds of heart valves furthermore how can i obey such a spick-and-span boss having known the smoky gods of antarctica who recognize each other solely by the nose and can end rebellions with a glance and count the deaths as members of the crew how can i take orders from a boss whose name is n't shackleton 17 `` second in command ” “ lieutenant ” “ shackleton ’ s right hand ” what did she see so clearly in me my drama teacher in elementary school when she 'd always assign me the role of father joseph of gaspar the magi offering jesus frankincense or of john the baptist always there to clear the path what did she see in my metallic pupils baritone voice infrequent speech as if scissors bandage and iodine inside a first aid kit under antarctica 's naked sky each of us followed his own star even the carpenter his own heraldic calling you didn ’ t need much to feed them just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents punctured holes my star was weak you could hardly see it hidden behind another larger troubled star like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks more attractive when absent 18. what happened afterward can be told in a few words i worked in a mine earth ’ s warm heart happened to be crueler than her frozen brain i laid railroad tracks south always toward the unknown it was like playing only two strings on a violin joy and sorrow fatefully blending at the horizon i repaired houses another waste of time i never understood their weak points just as you ca n't make out eyes from genitals or mouth in some underwater creatures and when i was left penniless i gave lectures about antarctica water gurgling in my gullet every five words for those few who listened patiently to an adventure of survival then bea arrived or sweet beatrice it was easy to grant her what i had left in my heart —that set of heavy museum keys— with no fear she might lose them tired lungs and liver could barely follow my split image of bust and bottle of booze like a prophet in the last circle of dante ’ s inferno i carried my own decapitated head in hand my ashes were lost at the base of a church no one thought of them it was a time of war another world war the second one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either 19. some of us died in the war others took to the sea again the gray cracked waters of the south decks perspiring fuel and alcohol our random itineraries full-time melancholics for months in antarctica we waited for our shadow to return and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your lifetime the way one consumes chickenpox and the rest of the time we counted the scars left on our faces with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic or childlike
lucretius grabbed my arm and led me to the spot where he went nuts i watered little drums right away and entangled the sava river with knitting needles i putrefied a small soup dismembered seven towels there he — the terrible — burnt on the stake squatted too my god i beat him up his ass puff puff but no one had heard a thing now here i ’ m flooded with flowers by cumin even tarkovsky appears now i will suck you with my thumbs mold you like clay with my horns till he ’ d vaporize and see into what and where i ’ ve traveled to into honor into white birch trees into the pouch used for bread i hung around the world a lot frothily crushing the mountain range with no avail with no day ’ s pay sticky are my laws i protected an elephant as much as i could stared at the back of the horse joshed the others now too tested spring mattresses kept gulping nirvana loosened feathery leaves wrapped the emperor into a roll to not let my senses perish to gallop without a break

themiscyra 72 bc while lucullus raided cherry orchards he left us to besiege grudgingly this outlander fortress named for an amazon queen while thinking of food and home not one of us has seen a single horse-borne warrior woman meanwhile we dug a tomb we intended it as the tunnel through which we ’ d claim the fort we shored up the sifting roof and dug by lamps that shed more shadows than light at last we formed up underground to attack with sword and fire but the enemy tossed in hives and in a cloud of stinging bees our torches jerked and swung or fell so we could hardly tell where to strike or what for next our enemy sent weasels in and foxes which seemed to be done in jest until we felt their teeth and heard more than saw the larger beasts a wolf began my death i lay in men ’ s and weasels ’ blood and heard the body that dropped at my side ask what barbarian thought to make of thoughtless creatures weapons of war but a flung torch showed me the face of a bear that said nothing and died then came the boar

when she was seven my grandmother suffered from fever and swollen glands the doctors believed her tonsils were inflamed that she needed surgery instead she went to a curandera the curandera divined that a jealous relative had cast a curse on her and now her language of kindness was bound to her throat the unspoken swelling her glands as a child my grandmother spoke to santitos with a voice like a chestnut ruddy and warm seeds dropping from her mouth the santitos would take her words into themselves her voice growing within them like grapevines during the tonsillitis when the words no longer fell like seeds from her lips the santito 's vineyards of accent and voice grew vapid dry as a parched mouth they went to her tongue and asked why silence imprisoned the words of the child why lumps were present under her chin why tears drew channels down her cheeks i asked my grandmother how her tongue replied after touching my cheek she told me she had a dream that night she was within her lungs and she rose like breath through the moist of her throat she remembered her tonsils swinging before her like fleshy apples then a hand taking them into a fist harvesting their sound she told me her throat opened in two spots like insect eyes and the names of her children came flying through her wounds like peacocks patting my thigh she said `` that is why the name of your mother is maria because she is a prayer a song of praise to the holy mother '' she told me this then showed me two scars on her throat—tiny scars like two eyelids stitched closed

to mary — — 1. so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart 's home as to his queen some victor knight of faëry earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light 2. the toil which stole from thee so many an hour is ended —and the fruit is at thy feet no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet water-falls leap among wild islands green which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss-grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been 3. thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit 's sleep a fresh may-dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near school-room voices that alas were but one echo from a world of woes— the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes 4. and then i clasped my hands and looked around— —but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground— so without shame i spake — '' i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check '' i then controuled my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold 5. and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined 6. alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one — such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone — yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clog until revived by thee 7. thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long 8. no more alone through the world 's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went.— there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood 9. now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power which says —let scorn be not repaid with scorn and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life 's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me the parents of the song i consecrate to thee 10. is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again though it might shake the anarch custom 's reign and charm the minds of men to truth 's own sway holier than was amphion 's i would fain reply in hope—but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey 11. and what art thou i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally 12. they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth of glorious parents thou aspiring child i wonder not—for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name 13. one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desart hears the music of his home —unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low-thoughted cares like thunder-stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling-place 14. truth 's deathless voice pauses among mankind if there must be no response to my cry— if men must rise and stamp with fury blind on his pure name who loves them —thou and i sweet friend can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world 's tempestuous night — two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman 's sight that burn from year to year with unextinguished light
the kiss is strictly speaking a passing of of twice a bead from her mouth to his then back ad nauseam and the boys who lived and died for it the lovely girl amassing ninety-nine spirits and in high spirits for consuming her highest amount once the hundredth boy arrived she starts her hunt in her haunt a hill ’ s field filled with fitting artemisia absinthium and every day they kissed to swap the bead and for a month he waned and wans and when he learned the truth about her tongue he downed the bead her true form a nine-tailed fox who could have turned human had he kissed on
poor thing she holds him on her lap the godless hidden god causing the lips of those that sleep to speak cold shadow of the white acanthus in its tiptoe dance buy the truth and sell it not a lion is in the streets there is a lion in the way my niece the little siren taught her the slang mad married fiancée dido has a quiver she wears a spotted lynx skin and a belt my undefiled is not herself tonight but one thing ’ s forever i just saw the video explaining the neighborhood applause a book of anthems where sirens plunge into the gold of the initials at that karaoke party for her boyfriend we cooked up all the goodies and fauns come through the windows that ’ s her thing “ i like this path to darkness ” she keeps saying whatever party fame 's doing to her chances for a quick trial barbarella can ’ t touch her goldilocks that dog do n't bird for she coming back or not
the woman is daft invented her own sect has upside-down sex with alternate species you see her on the street corner of sansome and pine morning rev up of sf financial types instead there she is beneath a gigantic hat hair wild in coils like a rattle- snake smiles like she ’ s got the shakes every cell in her seems to vibrate psst could you turn that to low the gray-suited heads bent to cement pass edges of her sleeves are threads her clothes mismatch the shoes are not a pair she stands as you stare or better yet ignore you ask her if she ’ s fine and she replies fan- tastic as if this were the day she ’ d finally learned to levitate and her eyes are the doors to a holographic universe and she looks right through you as if you too had won the lottery of the soul and you look down at your shiny perfectly symmetrical shoes like man that ’ s more than i wanted to know and — didn ’ t anyone tell you you need a reason — a house you own matching clothes translucent skin sheen of fashion a pulsing bank account like our galaxy always expanding — to feel so friggin ’ over the moon who are you how do you justify you what made you you what context gave you you and on the curb you kick swing scuff your shoes the woman is daft invented her own sect probably has no sex or too much with any species she hasn ’ t yet learned that happiness is contingent — it depends upon the things aforelisted she ’ s just riding on the being of being hedonist on her hand a rock as if eons ago the glacier had swung by and deposited a boulder on her finger the elemental pinned to her the woman is daft i tell you adrift steer clear the glint in her — shield your eyes downcast don ’ t let it get to you she will die alone — while you you ’ ll have — have — resist do not i say do not long for that magic
the glassy hill i clomb for thee for surefooted step hooves behoove the haver the sky redid blue the woman wavered and the black bull the vanquisher vanished she called out to nothing and in vain shed tears until she reached the glass hill ’ s impasse served her standard fairy tale penance passim served her seven to be given iron shoes to — at last — scale the hill the earned neared end each step conquered territory at last the sleeping prince-once-bull torrid tearing of clothes tearing on one ’ s clothes three nights of this until the prince awakes how she exhausted must have felt in the at long last the ever after happily i guess but a long time until laughter
they staunched the wound with a stone they drew blue venom from his blood until there was none when his veins ran true his face remained lifeless and all the mothers of the village wept and pounded their chests until the sky had little choice but to grant their supplications god made the boy breathe again god breathes life into us it is said only once but this case was an exception god drew back in a giant gust and blew life into the boy and like a stranded fish he shuddered oceanless it was true the boy lived he lived for a very long time the toxins were an oil slick contaminated cleaned but just as soon as the women kissed redness back into his cheeks the boy began to die again he continued to die for the rest of his life the dying took place slowly sweetly the dying took a very long time
if the ashes of mark twain lie in the mississippi river then i ’ m sure he does rise up some days emerge from dark polluted depths to walk over water to land and scans the horizon for change being a curious sort he sees the crisis rise again another war on the horizon and shakes his craggy head to say no not again he hopes truth-sayers still exist who don ’ t have to wait until their dead december 2002
hamelin town 's in brunswick by famous hanover city the river weser deep and wide washes its wall on the southern side a pleasanter spot you never spied but when begins my ditty almost five hundred years ago to see the townsfolk suffer so from vermin was a pity rats they fought the dogs and killed the cats and bit the babies in the cradles and eat the cheeses out of the vats and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles split open the kegs of salted sprats made nests inside men 's sunday hats and even spoiled the women 's chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats at last the people in a body to the town hall came flocking 'tis clear cried they our mayor 's a noddy and as for our corporation — shocking to think we buy gowns lined with ermine for dolts that ca n't or wo n't determine what 's like to rid us of our vermin rouse up sirs give your brains a racking to find the remedy we 're lacking or sure as fate we 'll send you packing at this the mayor and corporation quaked with a mighty consternation an hour they sate in council at length the mayor broke silence for a guilder i 'd my ermine gown sell i wish i were a mile hence it 's easy to bid one rack one 's brain — i 'm sure my poor head aches again i 've scratched it so and all in vain oh for a trap a trap a trap just as he said this what should hap at the chamber door but a gentle tap bless us cried the mayor what 's that with the corporation as he sate looking little though wondrous fat only a scraping of shoes on the mat anything like the sound of a rat makes my heart go pit-a-pat come in — the mayor cried looking bigger and in did come the strangest figure his queer long coat from heel to head was half of yellow and half of red and he himself was tall and thin with sharp blue eyes each like a pin and light loose hair yet swarthy skin no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin but lips where smiles went out and in — there was no guessing his kith and kin and nobody could enough admire the tall man and his quaint attire quoth one it 's as my great-grandsire starting up at the trump of doom 's tone had walked this way from his painted tombstone he advanced to the council-table and please your honours said he i 'm able by means of a secret charm to draw all creatures living beneath the sun that creep or swim or fly or run after me so as you never saw and i chiefly use my charm on creatures that do people harm the mole and toad and newt and viper and people call me the pied piper and here they noticed round his neck a scarf of red and yellow stripe to match with his coat of the self-same cheque and at the scarf 's end hung a pipe and his fingers they noticed were ever straying as if impatient to be playing upon this pipe as low it dangled over his vesture so old-fangled yet said he poor piper as i am in tartary i freed the cham last june from his huge swarms of gnats i eased in asia the nizam of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats and as for what your brain bewilders if i can rid your town of rats will you give me a thousand guilders one fifty thousand — was the exclamation of the astonished mayor and corporation into the street the piper stept smiling first a little smile as if he knew what magic slept in his quiet pipe the while then like a musical adept to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered you heard as if an army muttered and the muttering grew to a grumbling and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling and out of the houses the rats came tumbling great rats small rats lean rats brawny rats brown rats black rats grey rats tawny rats grave old plodders gay young friskers fathers mothers uncles cousins cocking tails and pricking whiskers families by tens and dozens brothers sisters husbands wives — followed the piper for their lives from street to street he piped advancing and step for step they followed dancing until they came to the river weser wherein all plunged and perished — save one who stout as julius caesar swam across and lived to carry as he the manuscript he cherished to rat-land home his commentary which was at the first shrill notes of the pipe i heard a sound as of scraping tripe and putting apples wondrous ripe into a cider-press 's gripe and a moving away of pickle-tub-boards and a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards and a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks and a breaking the hoops of butter-casks and it seemed as if a voice sweeter than by harp or by psaltery is breathed called out oh rats rejoice the world is grown to one vast drysaltery 'so munch on crunch on take your nuncheon 'breakfast supper dinner luncheon and just as one bulky sugar-puncheon ready staved like a great sun shone glorious scarce an inch before me just as methought it said come bore me — i found the weser rolling o'er me you should have heard the hamelin people ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple go cried the mayor and get long poles poke out the nests and block up the holes consult with carpenters and builders and leave in our town not even a trace of the rats — when suddenly up the face of the piper perked in the market-place with a first if you please my thousand guilders a thousand guilders the mayor looked blue so did the corporation too for council dinners made rare havock with claret moselle vin-de-grave hock and half the money would replenish their cellar 's biggest butt with rhenish to pay this sum to a wandering fellow with a gipsy coat of red and yellow beside quoth the mayor with a knowing wink our business was done at the river 's brink we saw with our eyes the vermin sink and what 's dead ca n't come to life i think so friend we 're not the folks to shrink from the duty of giving you something for drink and a matter of money to put in your poke but as for the guilders what we spoke of them as you very well know was in joke beside our losses have made us thrifty a thousand guilders come take fifty the piper 's face fell and he cried no trifling i ca n't wait beside i 've promised to visit by dinner time bagdat and accept the prime of the head cook 's pottage all he 's rich in for having left in the caliph 's kitchen of a nest of scorpions no survivor — with him i proved no bargain-driver with you do n't think i 'll bate a stiver and folks who put me in a passion may find me pipe after another fashion how cried the mayor d 'ye think i 'll brook being worse treated than a cook insulted by a lazy ribald with idle pipe and vesture piebald you threaten us fellow do your worst blow your pipe there till you burst once more he stept into the street and to his lips again laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane and ere he blew three notes such sweet soft notes as yet musician 's cunning never gave th'enraptured air there was a rustling that seem 'd like a bustling of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling small feet were pattering wooden shoes clattering little hands clapping and little tongues chattering and like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering out came the children running all the little boys and girls with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls tripping and skipping ran merrily after the wonderful music with shouting and laughter the mayor was dumb and the council stood as if they were changed into blocks of wood unable to move a step or cry to the children merrily skipping by — could only follow with the eye that joyous crowd at the piper 's back but how the mayor was on the rack and the wretched council 's bosoms beat as the piper turned from the high street to where the weser rolled its waters right in the way of their sons and daughters however he turned from south to west and to coppelburg hill his steps addressed and after him the children pressed great was the joy in every breast he never can cross that mighty top he 's forced to let the piping drop and we shall see our children stop when lo as they reached the mountain 's side a wondrous portal opened wide as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed and the piper advanced and the children follow 'd and when all were in to the very last the door in the mountain side shut fast did i say all no one was lame and could not dance the whole of the way and in after years if you would blame his sadness he was used to say — it 's dull in our town since my playmates left i ca n't forget that i 'm bereft of all the pleasant sights they see which the piper also promised me for he led us he said to a joyous land joining the town and just at hand where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew and flowers put forth a fairer hue and every thing was strange and new the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here and their dogs outran our fallow deer and honey-bees had lost their stings and horses were born with eagles wings and just as i felt assured my lame foot would be speedily cured the music stopped and i stood still and found myself outside the hill left alone against my will to go now limping as before and never hear of that country more alas alas for hamelin there came into many a burgher 's pate a text which says that heaven 's gate opes to the rich at as easy a rate as the needle 's eye takes a camel in the mayor sent east west north and south to offer the piper by word of mouth wherever it was men 's lot to find him silver and gold to his heart 's content if he 'd only return the way he went and bring the children behind him but when they saw 't was a lost endeavour and piper and dancers were gone for ever they made a decree that lawyers never should think their records dated duly if after the day of the month and year these words did not as well appear '' and so long after what happened here `` on the twenty-second of july '' thirteen hundred and seventy-six '' and the better in memory to fix the place of the children 's last retreat they called it the pied piper 's street — where any one playing on pipe or tabor was sure for the future to lose his labour nor suffered they hostelry or tavern to shock with mirth a street so solemn but opposite the place of the cavern they wrote the story on a column and on the great church window painted the same to make the world acquainted how their children were stolen away and there it stands to this very day and i must not omit to say that in transylvania there 's a tribe of alien people who ascribe the outlandish ways and dress on which their neighbours lay such stress to their fathers and mothers having risen out of some subterraneous prison into which they were trepanned long time ago in a mighty band out of hamelin town in brunswick land but how or why they do n't understand so willy let you and me be wipers of scores out with all men — especially pipers and whether they pipe us from rats or from mice if we 've promised them aught let us keep our promise
she kept its bones in a glass case next to the recliner in the living room and sometimes thought she heard him mewing like a faint background music but if she stopped to listen it disappeared likewise with a nuzzling around her calves she ’ d reach absent-mindedly to scratch him but her fingers found nothing but air one day in the corner of her eye slinking by the sofa there was a shadow she glanced over expecting it to vanish but this time it remained she looked at it full on she watched it move low and angular not quite as catlike as one might suppose but still it was him she walked to the door just like in the old days and opened it and met a whoosh of winter air she waited the bones in the glass case rattled then the cat-shadow darted at her through her legs and slipped outside it mingled with the shadows of bare branches and leapt at the shadow of a bird she looked at the tree but there was no bird then he blended into the shadow of a bush she stood in the threshold her hands on the door the sharp breeze ruffling the faded flowers of her house dress and she could feel her own bones rattling in her body her own shadow trying to slip out

mountains and the breasts of rivers and the flanks of prairies and the wombs of valleys swells the victory march of the republic in the masculine allegro of factories and the blues rhapsody of express trains in the bass crescendo of power dams and the nocturne adagio of river boats in the sound and fury of threshing machines and the clarineting needles of textile mills in the fortissimo hammers of

for rachel right shoulder aching with day-long butchery left shoulder numb with dints clanged on the shield the hero is fouled with blood his own and others ’ first slick then sticky then caked starting to mat his beard—the armor deadweight all around him his teeth grit and rattle with every jolt of bronze-rimmed wheels behind the shit-flecked horses but when he glimpses the mountains the distant snow a blankness swoons upon him and he hears nothing but the white vowels of the wind brushing through stands of spears like conifers while a banner slips its staff and hangs in the blue like a kestrel or a contrail the hero ’ s death the prize elusive quarry of his life stands stock-still in her cloven tracks in snow and turns one ear tuned to the creek ’ s far bank one dished towards him her unstartled gaze beads on him like a sniper ’ s sights until at the clean report of a cracking poplar branch she leaps away like luck over rapid water and snowfall scrims the scene like a mist of tears like a migraine like sweat or blood streaming into your eyes
and now the heavens shift and the night comes in and covers with its darkness earth and sky and the tricks of the myrmidons throughout the city the trojans wearied by joy lie fast asleep and now the greeks set out from tenedos their ships proceeding in an ordered line under the friendly light of the silent moon making their way toward the shore they know so well and when the royal galley ’ s beacon light is lighted sinon sees it and quietly goes protected by malign complicit fates and furtively opens up the horse ’ s flank and frees the argive warriors from its womb the horse releases them to the open air and joyfully they come out first come the captains thessander and sthenelus and dire ulysses lowering themselves to the ground by means of a rope and acamas and thoas and pyrrhus achilles ’ son and machaon the prince and menelaus and epeus he who contrived the wooden horse that fooled us so and then they enter the city that ’ s deep submerged in wine and unknowing sleep they surprise and kill the watch and open the gates to welcome in their comrades from the fleet letting them in for what they are going to do
the time of breathing into clasped hands hovering over a lighter to make a flame not knowing that an angry man threw his eyes into the night the belly of his shattered father weeping rain for separation of earth and sky harvesting bitter grudges from minds like hardened soil packing up the wounds with mud and whiskey and opening doors to wait for those curious to know how sky maps granted our existence how the weight of earth pushed against tongues of oars and our tīpuna pushed back and won
when the moon ’ s worn scutcheon touches the flint-gray flood i will lave him in foxglove and vetch until the blood of his wretched heart heals without a scar he stood— as the men make their way into the quaking wood
the philosopher david lewis spun a fantasy of two omniscient gods who know about one world which might as well be ours each knows precisely all there is to know the grand “ totality of facts not things. ” each knows the pattern of the light on each neglected leaf millennia ago each knows the number of the stars their ages all the distances between them all the “ things too tiny to be remembered in recorded history—the backfiring of a bus/in a paris street in 1932 ” as well as all the things that history distorts or just can ’ t see like the thought that must have flashed across patroklos ’ s mind if he ’ d existed and had had a mind—the middle knowledge of the schoolmen when hektor split his stomach with a spear if he ’ d existed too each one looks on as though through ordinary eyes as “ mme swann ’ s enormous coachman supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as st george in the picture endeavored to curb the ardour of the quivering steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered over the ground ” and sees “ the gray ‘ toppers ’ of old ” the gentlemen strolling with her wore the little “ woolen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge feathers ” that she wore or would have worn if they and she ’ d been real each monitors the photons through the slits the slow decay of radium and knows the ratio of vermouth to gin in someone ’ s first martini at larre ’ s each knows what darragh geoff and willy knew before the bullet or the pavement killed their worlds and where the shots came from in dallas each knows precisely what the other knows in all the senses of those words and if a question has a factual answer each can answer it yet there ’ s a question neither can resolve which god am i the question posits both a world and a unique perspective on that world which neither has and if gods one and two could reify themselves by wondering who or what they were they ’ d have to know the answer—and because they don ’ t they can ’ t could gods like those be real in something like the sense that you and i are real but then what sense is that gods one and two are you and i writ large i wander out into the day and feel the sunlight on my face i see the sunlight on the first spring leaves like green foam on the trees and so do you the world we have in common that the gods can comprehend in its entirety remains beyond my grasp and yours the world i know belongs entirely to me as yours belongs entirely to you i know my world completely as the gods know ours because it ’ s nothing but my take on things and starts and ends with me i ’ m both the author and the captive of my world because my take on things is all there is to me when mary in frank jackson ’ s philosophical diversion wanders from her room of black and white and shades of gray and finally sees a rose and then goes on in sunlight into the hofgarten and drinks coffee and talks for hours it ’ s hard to see how all of this as she might say could be an artifact of her perspective but it is so what philosophers tell stories but they make them up and what are they to me sometimes i think i ’ m humoring myself a good thing i suppose with an extended exercise in nonsense have breakfast have a cup of strong black common sense get over it i tell myself refuting berkeley with my foot instead of this entanglement of self with self why can ’ t i just relax into my place inside the natural order be a thing within the solid scheme of things a dane in denmark how can fantasies unreal by definition show me what i am and know how can the poetry of possibilities dissolve the prose of facts my little life sustains me while it can and that ’ s enough it may be all contingent but it ’ s real and when catastrophes occur as they inevitably do i ’ d rather they occur to me instead of writing them away or redefining happiness or sorrow or tranquility as alterations of some abstract point of view that points at nothing inescapable illusions must be real or might as well be real no matter where reflection on them leads and if accepting them means taking things on faith that ’ s fine who wants to be a posit or a site of possibilities who wants to walk out and evaporate into this green spring day who wants to have sex with a wraith no matter where reflection on them leads it leads of course to me a cri de coeur is not an argument but where the real argument begins hopkins “ searching nature i taste self at one tankard that of my own being. ” kant “ the feeling of an existence without the least concept ” meaning that despite the certainty i have i ’ ve no idea what i really am or where and as for “ searching nature ” i have no idea even where to start these matters mean the world to me and yet no matter how i try to come to grips with them they slip away i and here and now are ever present yet they vanish in the act of apprehension as a poem turns into language as you write it down dimensionless atemporal imprisoned in the present—even as i say them to myself the words fall short of what i thought i started out to say like the conclusion of an argument too close to me to share or like an empty thought balloon that hangs above me in the air it ’ s not the question of what makes me who i am through time—of how a figure in a photograph from 1985 a couple sitting in the garden of the small hôtel des marronniers just off the rue jacob could be the person who remembers her and thinks of him today—but of what constitutes me now and of what made me then if giving it a name won ’ t help then neither will pretending it ’ s divine if i should be supplanted by a bright recording angel knowing everything about me in the way the gods know all about their world i wouldn ’ t have survived she takes the whole thing in—the house on maxim street the bike rides down the hill on wabash street my high school friends their friends the friends of friends of friends—with eyes that monitor my back my face the traces in my brain projected on a screen the n degrees of separation linking me to nearly everyone who ’ s ever lived a thing within a wilderness of things with each one locked inside a universe with no outside of which there ’ s nothing she can see how could it be an afterlife it ’ s just a different life another life complete or incomplete as anyone ’ s consumed by questions that elude it not because she can ’ t remember but because the words that make them up are undefined which one of them was i which world was mine
all this havoc just means i ’ m a poor wizard once i lit three twigs and fanned the smoke from miles away into the girl who jumbled scales through my spine as she vanished i clapped a delighted tune but not without aches of my own did the sack of no echoes fail me now on such a mild curse— boils sewn eyes a shrew in the loin my ankle reddens up and eyes me with disdain toenails fall off how far will this go poor wizard poorly done in these pangs are power are power as both knees lock up ashamed to move under me

in tamalpais is a big crystal an acquaintance told me the story a miwok was giving his grandfather ’ s medicine bag to the kroeber museum in berkeley he said this man took him over the mountain tamalpais at a certain time in the year i believe it was about the time of the winter solstice because then the tides are really low they stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over the mountain on their way to the bolinas beach clam patch where there is a big rock way out there go out to the rock take out of the medicine bag the crystal that matches the crystal in tamalpais and if your heart is not true if your heart is not true when you tap the rock in the clam patch a little piece of it will fly off and strike you in the heart and strike you dead and that ’ s the first story i ever heard about bolinas
the work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty chiefly because i can not concentrate i have no feeling about whether what i am writing is good or bad and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me and i am sure i know the reason it ’ s that i can ’ t stand leaving unresolved my situation with pat i hear from her fairly frequently asking when i plan to come back and she knows that i am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of january it is not mainly loneliness i feel though i feel it but i have been lonely before it is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us and that in the mean time i worry about how things are going to work out this has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before – from a letter to his parents dated november 9 1955 rome hardly enough for me that the pail of water alive with the wrinkling light brings clearness home and whiter than mind conceives the walls mature to white or that the washed tomatoes whose name is given to love fulfill their bowl and the roman sea is woven together by threading fish and made most whole i delight in each of these delight moreover in the dark skill of those hands closer to wise than clever of our blind italian landlady who stands her shoes fouled with the lustful blood of rabbit lightly dispatched and dressed fixing it to the gibbet of the clothesline where the laundry sails to rest these textures solicit of us our instant homage but are disparate senseless things unless a reigning image bring them to purpose as your presence brings the world in offering like a chaplet worn in aphrodite ’ s name the furious unicorn come to the virgin ’ s lap tethered and tame and thus it is as you stand in this morning ’ s shadows where ancient chamber pots are grown to little meadows of mint and parsley surely it ’ s love unknots the winds for ulysses and recalls to man a summer without cease sprung from the same dishpan onion and lily work their primal peace
my dear your eyes are weary rest them a little while assume the languid posture of pleasure mixed with guile outside the talkative fountain continues night and day repeating my warm passion in whatever it has to say the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebe ’ s very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears thus your soul ignited by pleasure ’ s lusts and needs sprays into heaven ’ s reaches and dreams of fiery deeds then it brims over dying and languorous apart drains down some slope and enters the dark well of my heart the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebe ’ s very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears o you whom night enhances how sweet here at your breasts to hear the eternal sadness of water that never rests o moon o singing fountain o leaf-thronged night above you are the faultless mirrors of my sweet bitter love the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebe ’ s very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears
our vice runs beyond all that old men saw and far authentically above our laws and scorning virtues safe and golden mean sits uncontrolled upon the high extreme circes thy monsters painted out the hue of feigned filthiness but ours is true our vice puts down all proverbs and all themes our vice excels all fables and all dreams

when i woke the darkness was so thick so palpable and black that my eyes seemed blind as stone staring into stone the blade that i had dreamed efficient and quick as it cut into my thigh cleaning a gangrened wound infected to the bone seemed poised above my throat close-grained impenetrable the blackness rose before me like a wall and then off in the next room nervous light a soft padding as of an animal raced like my heartbeat in my temples round and round trapped stealthily desperate as if hunting its own track terrified and captivated by its own odor skin cool in the night air eyes drilling through the dark who i was before i slept had burned off like a vapor so that amnesiac and pure witnessing my terror that i no longer recognized as my own my mind floated beyond me to confront that frantic closing footfall as jacob dreaming met his dark angel— though in my wrestling nothing blessed me or promised any blessing but was a mask whose eyes were all black pupil blind as molten tar i strained to see what paced there my eyes burning through the dark until a pair of eyes blazed back across the blackness an insistent glazed staring that shimmered and disappeared the shining blade plunged at my throat my mind stretched and twisted its wires tightening and turning as the creature lunged back and forth and with a deep-throated yowling thrashing and thrashing to fight clear of its own circling cleanly leapt away i reached for the knife but gripped only air my eyes pressing deeper and deeper into the night ’ s black stone cutting the way the knife had cut into my wound probing for the white shining of the bone what had i become what darkness had my dream led me down into too frightened even to move i lay bound and sweating in the sheets the moon a warning-bell beating on the glass its light carving out the curtains like the shadow of a wing across the windowpane
with her hair closely cropped up to the nape like dorian apollo ’ s the girl lay on the narrow pallet keeping her limbs stiffly frozen within a heavy cloud she could not escape ... artemis emptied her quiver—every arrow shot through her body and though very soon she ’ d be no virgin like cold honeycomb her virgin thighs still kept her pleasure sealed ... as if to the arena the youth came oiled with myrrh and like a wrestler kneeled to pin her down and although he broke past her arms that she had thrust against his chest only much later with one cry face to face did they join lips and out of their sweat embrace ...
a branch the hand of apollo the plane tree ’ s polished broad bough spread above you may it bring you the universe ’ s immortal peace you ’ d meet me on the broad and shining shore of pylos so i ’ d planned with mentor ’ s tall ship pulled up on the beach snug in the sand we would be bound as those who sailed with the gods in the winged friendship of youth and would take our seats in the stone thrones that time and custom had made smooth and meet that man who still in the third generation reigned serene a sage whose tales of travels and holy decrees had ripened in his mind with age— at dawn we ’ d attend the sacrifice to the gods the ritual slaughters of the three-year-old heifers and hear the single cry that rose from his three daughters when the axe thwacked and the black-fringed slow-rolling eye drowned in a swoon of darkness and the gilt horns were rendered idle a hazy half moon my love imagined you as a sister her brother in your virginal bath how polycaste rinsed your naked body and dressed you in a robe of fine cloth i thought to prod you a little with my foot as dawn was about to break the gleaming chariot ’ s yoked for us and ready no time to lose awake and to spend all day in the talk that comes and goes or silence when no one spoke while we drove the horses who were always leaning one way or another against the yoke but most of all i wanted to see your eyes your deer-like eyes behold the palace of menelaus and forget themselves in bronze and the gleam of gold unwavering gaze sinking the sight so deep you ’ d never remember the figured silver the ivory gilded or white the heavy amber and i thought that i would say in a hushed voice leaning close to your ear watch out my friend because in a moment soon helen will appear before our very eyes the one and only daughter of the swan and then we will sink our eyelids in the river of oblivion • so brightly i saw you but what grassy roads have led me to your tomb and the blazing roses with which i strew your grave and make all rome abloom light the way unto your golden songs as though they were the brave armed bodies that turn to dust before one ’ s eyes in an ancient new-breached grave and all the worthy treasure of mycenae the golden plunder i thought to lay before you—goblet sword and diadem—past wonder a mask on your dead beauty like the mask that covered the face of the king of the achaeans—all gold all artifice hammered upon death ’ s trace
in one version you must convince every living thing one by one to weep until he climbs back into the marriage-house that earth about which it is said that bread is the glue of the earth certainly glue is money the phrase “ the tears of things ” is money the revelation of the woman clothed in the sun is money the lake is a disc of bright money buying a few plain birds down they climb back nervously as you hurry through plain birds like a plain song that moment when four or five are around your knees like zeno ’ s arrow rising by halves like eurydice ’ s bread still the possibility they might intersect you would be the one who was struck by a flying bird somewhere between a blesséd fool village idiot the only one to persist outside the local economy drooling at travelers holding yourself slinging incomprehensible advice you would learn the trick with museum wire where you snap the heads off quiet animals in front of the store tempted equally by science dirty work i am trying to invent a way for you to buy me back—
alone in the library room even when others are there in the room alone except for themselves there is the illusion of peace the air in the room is stilled there are reading lights on the tables looking as if they 're reading looking as if they 're studying the text and understanding shedding light on what the words are saying but under their steady imbecile gaze the page is blank patiently waiting not to be blank the page is blank until the mind that reads crosses the black river seeking the queen of the underworld persephone where she sits by the side of the one who brought her there from enna hades the mute the deaf king of the dead letter she is clothed in the beautiful garment of our thousand misunderstandings of the sacred text
after you left me forever i was broken into pieces and all the pieces flung into the river then the legs crawled ashore and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow-track they became for a while a simple roadside shrine a tiny table set up between the thighs held a dusty candle weed-and-fieldflower chains placed reverently there by children and old women my knees were hung with tin triangular medals to cure all forms of hysterical disease after i died forever in the river my torso floated bloated in the stream catching on logs or stones among the eddies white water foamed around it then dislodged it after a whirlwind trip it bumped ashore a grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks had already rescued my arms and put them by knowing everything has its uses sooner or later when he found my torso he called it his canoe and using my arms as paddles he rowed me up and down the scummy river when catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up and blessed his reusable bait clumsy but serviceable that canoe the trail of blood that was its wake attracted the carp and eels and the river turtle easily landed dazed by my tasty red a young lad found my head among the rushes and placed it on a dry stone he carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell and set small offerings before it which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night so it seemed i ate and the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets so my lungs would sigh and my dead tongue mutter attached to my throat like a sacred necklace was a circlet of small snails soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head with its waterweed crown seers found occupation interpreting sighs and their papyrus rolls accumulated meanwhile young boys retrieved my eyes they used for marbles in a simple game till somebody ’ s pretty sister snatched at them and set them for luck in her bridal diadem poor girl when her future groom caught sight of her all eyes he crossed himself in horror and stumbled away in haste through her dowered meadows what then of my heart and organs my sacred slit which loved you best of all they were caught in a fisherman ’ s net and tossed at night into a pen for swine but they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded trampled one another in fear to get away and the fisherman ’ s wife who had thirteen living children and was contemptuous of holy love raked the rest of me onto the compost heap then in their various places and helpful functions the altar oracle offal canoe and oars learned the wild rumor of your return the altar leapt up and ran to the canoe scattering candle grease and wilted grasses arms sprang to their sockets blind hands with nibbled nails groped their way aided by loud lamentation to the bed of the bride snatched up those unlucky eyes from her discarded veil and diadem and rammed them home oh what a bright day it was this empty body danced on the riverbank hollow it called and searched among the fields for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun and never would have found them but then your great voice rang out under the skies my name —and all those private names for the parts and places that had loved you best and they stirred in their nest of hay and dung the distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar and the seers pursuing my skull their lost employment and the tumbling boys who wanted the magic marbles and the runaway groom and the fisherman ’ s thirteen children set up such a clamor with their cries of “ miracle ” that our two bodies met like a thunderclap in midday—right at the corner of that wretched field with its broken fenceposts and startled skinny cattle we fell in a heap on the compost heap and all our loving parts made love at once while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes and then went decently about their business and here it is moonlight again we ’ ve bathed in the river and are sweet and wholesome once more we kneel side by side in the sand we worship each other in whispers but the inner parts remember fermenting hay the comfortable odor of dung the animal incense and passion its bloody labor its birth and rebirth and decay

no one has touched me for weeks yet in this drugged gilt afternoon late when nothing is safe i ’ m paralyzed as though so wildly desired—passing solo through the garden ’ s cinnamon marigolds famished roses where a matted shingle of the swept-up human hair i begged from a local beauty shop spread out fruitlessly among the blooms canes to keep away the deer might well be a satyr passed out in the palace ’ s candied gold— that something regnant with a strange godlike power could not help but reach out from the umbral blue to tap my white arm it is a day to die the light autoerotic theatrical with an unbearable listing stalled in cusp in leonine torpor is courage artifice as though to answer were within my means or to even move my mouth
the fire was so fierce so red so gray so yellow that along with the land it burned part of the sky which stayed black in that corner for years as if it were night there even in the daytime a piece of the sky burnt and which then could not be counted on even by the birds it was a regular fire— terrible—we forget this about fire—terrible and full of pride it intended to be big no regular fire like so many of us it intended to be more and this time was it was not better or worse than any other fire growing up but this time it was a fire at just the right time and in just the right place— if you think like a fire— a place it could do something big its flames reached out with ten thousand pincers as if the fire were made of beetles and scorpions clawing themselves to get up pinching the air itself and climbing so many sharp animals on each other ’ s backs then into the air itself ten thousand snaps and pinches at least so that if the sky was made of something it could not get away this time finally the fire caught the sky which acted like a slow rabbit which had made a miscalculation it didn ’ t believe this could happen and so it ran left right into the thin toothpicks of flames too fast to pull back the sky with all its arms hands fingers fingernails all of it disappeared goodbye the sky stayed black for several years after i wanted to tell you this small story about the sky it ’ s a good one and explains why the sky comes so slowly in the morning still unsure of what ’ s here but the story is not mine it was written by fire that same small fire that wanted to come home with something of its own to tell and it did a small piece of blue in its mouth

amid the growing craze for automatons the voice within the device that moves is not as if nothing human could be quite that moving my precious edgling though some believe the answers be given by a man concealed these are speaking machines they were risking their lives usually a woman or a child who woke up inside the oracle who swallowed the burning oil and who forces the idols to speak though when the bishop theophilus broke open the statues at alexandria he found them hollow it does not necessarily follow that the penalty for trickery was death such is the wealth of belief behind a finely painted sheet of shell a voice unlatched surrounds the world
meanwhile meanwhile used to be my limp ’ s accompaniment meanwhile as my legs maneuvered an abyss a ballet is beginning and the dancer ’ s perfect feet propel her downstage where applause is waiting meanwhile a sad man stomps his gloom away by stomping evenly one two one two means never blue his motto goes but i was born to other paces different measures the roads i take are undulant and lined with fluid hedges trees that take a dive whenever i am near a bird ’ s ascent slows down to an eternal crawl and when a doctor ’ s order takes me to the city it is a jagged gotham full of spires that waver in the sky like falling knives or silver metronomes meanwhile meanwhile the rhythm steadied me a lover steals upon his mistress with the quietness that only flatfeet know so quietly that he might just as well have stayed at home i add when my self-confidence is at a high point and the view is at its best and sometimes i have thoughts before the surge of meanwhile drowns them out that limping is a thing i ’ d voluntarily take up if i were just as upright as the rest i see myself erect stampeding through a garden ’ s sturdy stale geometry and nearly knocked down by the urge to say incline i like your style ravine hello how many good things share your curvature it is the slant of rainfall when the wind convinces it to drift it is a sight that those with level heads and steady feet miss out on in a coracle my new enthusiasm leads to stories you are better bent the more you tilt the more the water welcomes you its addled waves a live reminder of your being there its leaping fish a sign that you are still alert and in command the clubfoots have a myth concerning orpheus ’ head and though i doubt its authenticity i like the way it goes hacked off the head was rolling down the river when a change came over it—it bobbed it jumped it shuddered it caught itself in weeds but struggled free because of all its energy and then its eyes began to come to life as if a pretty tune enthralled it even then meanwhile his killers marched away saying he had his ups and downs of course of course to hobble is to hinder sick is sick no matter how you change the second term to suit your needs but sometimes i am sure that when i limp along a crooked street my dancing shadow is a model for the stiffs who hurry past without a sound showing them this way that way as they reach the little level huts they call home
after our rendez-vous—this the last word he said waving to me as the train pulled away from the station and so it seemed harmless till evening brought the first prick of fever which soon trellised my veins at 2 am came that knock on the city gates little pig little pig let me come in ha ever a bold and warlike people we didn ’ t days of siege we threw corpses dead of plague from the tops of parapets to frighten it away but what was it that vatic voice was not like his at all and by its speech one could tell it somehow knew us well the mystery deepened a strange billowing cloud made my people short of breath i heard them wheezing the end seemed near what could this ailment be hunting out clues i went over the roses and snows of his departed face like a treasure map over his words hanging in air like the scrolls of alexandria had i not been consensual a free agent gay single as any singing lark who chooses to unlock to whom well one night finally i climbed our tallest tower lay in the open on its roof and had a brilliant dream i saw my body nestled between angels like the body of the prophet jesus i saw it leaking from a finger ’ s tip like a slit ragdoll and then i saw this feathery amorphous creature black as mildew in the bath soft as bread mold chewing on my bloodpuddings in the corner and then i knew that morning i went out by the porter ’ s door pressing one finger to judicious lips like oedipus your name i said i have it now despair— shrieking it vanished with brimstone and flames so i etched harmless in that ground of merds and moss and to this day my people listen to strangers crying wares with an intelligent ear remembering our grave old danger

you ignore the way light filters through my cells the way i have of fading out—still there is a constant tug a stretching what is left of me is coming loose soon i will be only crumbs of popcorn a blue ring in the tub an empty toilet paper roll black mold misted on old sponges strands of hair woven into carpet a warped door that won ’ t open the soft spot in an avocado celery a pear a metallic taste in the beer a cold sore on your lip—and when i finally lose my hold you will hear a rustle and watch me spill grains of rice across the cracked tile

so it is sleep comes not on my eyelids nor in my eyes with shaken hair and white aloof pale hands and lips and breasts of iron so she beholds me and yet though sleep comes not to me there comes a vision from the full smooth brow of sleep the white aphrodite moving unbounded by her own hair in the purple beaks of the doves that draw her beaks straight without desire necks bent backward toward lesbos and the flying feet of loves weeping behind her she looks not back she looks not back to where the nine crowned muses about apollo stand like nine corinthian columns singing in clear evening she sees not the lesbians kissing mouth to mouth across lute strings drunken with singing nor the white feet of the oceanides shining and unsandalled before her go cryings and lamentations of barren women a thunder of wings while ghosts of outcast lethean women lamenting stiffen the twilight

first night opened out bodies took root from rotting salt and seawater into evidence of red life relentless waves pumped tidal air into a single heartbeat in the pulp of shadow and space water sucked our people from sleep that ’ s how it all began at least that ’ s all we can remember to tell it began with water and heartbeat in minutes we tunneled through corn woman ’ s navel into tinges of moist red men and women yawning we collected our chins knees breasts and sure-footed determination a few thousand years before moses parted the red sea and the god with three heads was born in the middle east the choctaw people danced our homeland infra red finally when the stranger ’ s arms reached to strangle the west grandmother eavesdropped on the three-faced deity who said that chaos was coming when he puckered his lips and tried to kiss her she made it rain on him “ maybe you ’ ve forgotten you were born of water and women ” she said walking away laughing

it was the blind girl from the rez who stole the baker ’ s missing bread it was the guitar playing fool who crooned and raced the wild mustangs through our heads it was the village idiot who played his chess without the fool the bowl of soup who said too late too late too late to blame the thread the spoon the text the mole beside the waterfall of fallen things just east of town it was the bearded man attaching fallen things to angel ’ s wings while singing legends to the long long grass it was the moon who laughed and laughed it was the moon who laughed herself in half
at hawthorn-time in wiltshire travelling in search of something chance would never bring an old man ’ s face by life and weather cut and coloured —rough brown sweet as any nut — a land face sea-blue-eyed —hung in my mind when i had left him many a mile behind all he said was “ nobody can ’ t stop ’ ee it ’ s a footpath right enough you see those bits of mounds—that ’ s where they opened up the barrows sixty years since while i was scaring sparrows they thought as there was something to find there but couldn ’ t find it by digging anywhere. ” to turn back then and seek him where was the use there were three manningfords —abbots bohun and bruce and whether alton not manningford it was my memory could not decide because there was both alton barnes and alton priors all had their churches graveyards farms and byres lurking to one side up the paths and lanes seldom well seen except by aeroplanes and when bells rang or pigs squealed or cocks crowed then only heard ages ago the road approached the people stood and looked and turned nor asked it to come nearer nor yet learned to move out there and dwell in all men ’ s dust and yet withal they shot the weathercock just because ’ twas he crowed out of tune they said so now the copper weathercock is dead if they had reaped their dandelions and sold them fairly they could have afforded gold many years passed and i went back again among those villages and looked for men who might have known my ancient he himself had long been dead or laid upon the shelf i thought one man i asked about him roared at my description “ ’ tis old bottlesford he means bill. ” but another said “ of course it was jack button up at the white horse he ’ s dead sir these three years. ” this lasted till a girl proposed walker of walker ’ s hill “ old adam walker adam 's point you ’ ll see marked on the maps. ” “ that was her roguery ” the next man said he was a squire ’ s son who loved wild bird and beast and dog and gun for killing them he had loved them from his birth one with another as he loved the earth “ the man may be like button or walker or like bottlesford that you want but far more he sounds like one i saw when i was a child i could almost swear to him the man was wild and wandered his home was where he was free everybody has met one such man as he does he keep clear old paths that no one uses but once a lifetime when he loves or muses he is english as this gate these flowers this mire and when at eight years old lob-lie-by-the-fire came in my books this was the man i saw he has been in england as long as dove and daw calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree the rose campion bridget-in-her-bravery and in a tender mood he as i guess christened one flower love-in-idleness and while he walked from exeter to leeds one april called all cuckoo-flowers milkmaids from him old herbal gerard learnt as a boy to name wild clematis the traveller ’ s-joy our blackbirds sang no english till his ear told him they called his jan toy ‘ pretty dear. ’ she was jan toy the lucky who having lost a shilling and found a penny loaf rejoiced for reasons of his own to him the wren is jenny pooter before all other men ’ twas he first called the hog ’ s back the hog ’ s back that mother dunch ’ s buttocks should not lack their name was his care he too could explain totteridge and totterdown and juggler ’ s lane he knows if anyone why tumbling bay inland in kent is called so he might say “ but little he says compared with what he does if ever a sage troubles him he will buzz like a beehive to conclude the tedious fray and the sage who knows all languages runs away yet lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool and though he never could spare time for school to unteach what the fox so well expressed on biting the cock ’ s head off —quietness is best — he can talk quite as well as anyone after his thinking is forgot and done he first of all told someone else ’ s wife for a farthing she ’ d skin a flint and spoil a knife worth sixpence skinning it she heard him speak ‘ she had a face as long as a wet week ’ said he telling the tale in after years with blue smock and with gold rings in his ears sometimes he is a pedlar not too poor to keep his wit this is tall tom that bore the logs in and with shakespeare in the hall once talked when icicles hung by the wall as herne the hunter he has known hard times on sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes which others spoilt and hob being then his name he kept the hog that thought the butcher came to bring his breakfast ‘ you thought wrong ’ said hob when there were kings in kent this very lob whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry wedded the king ’ s daughter of canterbury for he alone unlike squire lord and king watched a night by her without slumbering he kept both waking when he was but a lad he won a rich man ’ s heiress deaf dumb and sad by rousing her to laugh at him he carried his donkey on his back so they were married and while he was a little cobbler ’ s boy he tricked the giant coming to destroy shrewsbury by flood ‘ and how far is it yet ’ the giant asked in passing ‘ i forget but see these shoes i ‘ ve worn out on the road and we ’ re not there yet. ’ he emptied out his load of shoes for mending the giant let fall from his spade the earth for damming severn and thus made the wrekin hill and little ercall hill rose where the giant scraped his boots while still so young our jack was chief of gotham ’ s sages but long before he could have been wise ages earlier than this while he grew thick and strong and ate his bacon or at times sang a song and merely smelt it as jack the giant-killer he made a name he too ground up the miller the yorkshireman who ground men ’ s bones for flour “ do you believe jack dead before his hour or that his name is walker or bottlesford or button a mere clown or squire or lord the man you saw —lob-lie-by-the-fire jack cade jack smith jack moon poor jack of every trade young jack or old jack or jack what-d ’ ye-call jack-in-the-hedge or robin-run-by-the-wall robin hood ragged robin lazy bob one of the lords of no man ’ s land good lob — although he was seen dying at waterloo hastings agincourt and sedgemoor too — lives yet he never will admit he is dead till millers cease to grind men ’ s bones for bread not till our weathercock crows once again and i remove my house out of the lane on to the road. ” with this he disappeared in hazel and thorn tangled with old-man ’ s-beard but one glimpse of his back as there he stood choosing his way proved him of old jack ’ s blood young jack perhaps and now a wiltshireman as he has oft been since his days began
1 taking advantage of the relationships and interaction which actually exist between what happens to her and her desire she creates some metaphors both obvious and opaque as screens of rays crisscrossing the landscape in which herself and what she expected from you in the way of support coincide so that i and you resemble each other now the way they light the land like infrared without a trace on film really part of your image was linked so closely to my desire it remained inside my body it never reached the emotions which tend to damage the body but which memory requires thus a formal device was discovered for detailing information that was intimate and largely unacceptable to what i thought i required from you regarding beauty in idea and form she expected distress to automatically bring about this beauty like a woman ’ s theft of fire rope from your house but not her hanging in the orchard by the house she was a stranger to you she was never in your consciousness hence she was never forgotten she is in you the way direct experience generates consciousness adding the energy of its materialization to live another person ’ s biography is not the same as to live his or her life she constructs a story line or cluster of anecdotal details like clothes around the body instruments of both defense and expansion which give meaning to fluctuations such as in pleasures occurring between herself and you her sunglasses swathed in feathers express the contingency of a light and a space so that the anecdote of a hanging could be utilized as colorist or combinatory data instead of her instinct for the imaginary in which what she imagines represents what happens whether or not it misrepresents it sometimes it happens during a routine she represents by evenness of light on the land or when things usually mean nothing like harmony in light what happens and something to mean join accidentally the thing isn ’ t what it is but it is like what it is like a fake it doesn ’ t mean anything although there is something to mean so that her solitude is the guise of unending repetition of a hanging or her relationship with you in which all that is to be included will find a place this is empathy or sharing her intuition with her you look into someone ’ s eyes as if you were seeing through the face 2 because it ’ s not possible to absorb more than one insight at a time there seems to be a contradiction between the visual or space and the context or meaning she felt deep uneasiness with the image of this sunset of unnatural energy its sinister expression of an order of impossible beauty we thought we lost accounting for the intensity of yellow light on the hill which is not a thing and it is not a metaphor the way your life is not a metaphor to her or the way intense light on the hill is a recollection en plein air in the sense that it happened soon the background turns gray and the hill regains its natural color but there are three dimensions of gray this is a metaphor for the fact that the hanged woman actually made contact with you although you never knew her there is a link with her appearance as with sex or the way a name is attached to something after naming it by the occurrence of its name in this case linking with the appearances or biographies of a whole parade of lovers so what she thinks of as human help from him is no longer dependent on changing her desire for him in the present but is a substitute for it the landscape is empty and it is immanent the context of the woman in its reality may differ from the context in which the viewer thinks about her the element of transparency the way the viewer thinks about her is the way low clouds extend a landscape the viewer is acting on the landscape in consideration that the context of the viewer distinct from the context of general human help could be a metaphor for itself there were yellow-leaved trees behind a screen of green ones at the edge of the orchard they are not a border between organization and decay of autumn trees which are organized the yellow leaves around your feet have an impossible beauty that was achieved and then lost a way you can define a woman is to remember everything the woman is not if you move your head fast enough you can all of a sudden discern the whole structure of the surface of each leaf and it links in your stomach as with sex if you remember not desiring her fast enough you can all of a sudden discern her whole body you can feel in your stomach the way any moment that happened and in which you think about her goes a long way toward convincing you of the autonomy and pre-existence of her form 3 her concentration became a direct experience of his life an erotic concentration her biography of her persistently locates the point of impact of one ’ s own system of representations insofar as vision itself is a representative operating on what she sees and for which a particular light can represent an initial condition even the slightest movement of a hand or a finger is controlled and emphasized as by a spotlight of this sensitiveness the way repetition is a cessation of the potential for conscious experience or death visiting the same places during the same seasons at almost the same hour so that landscape could be a simple repetition which thrives on reproduction in order to resolve what is happening into its own combination or name of words in the form of its time and in order to defer the story in a way her memory is a theory about how the hanged woman looked to her in the orchard which she has to respect in the sense that the landscape ’ s immanence is an organically developing failure of its language to speak its content the connection between word and idea corresponding to the landscape is retained but the connection between the word and the landscape is lost so the shadow of a hill stays dark during lightning how she sees the lightning is a time lapse into the planar dimension a hierarchy of grammar or deference by way of the word belonging to her such as lady suicide or woman suicide because the woman doesn ’ t die in her own absence or in effigy so that no existing philosophy and no philosopher will know soon enough points with enough speed to handle the richness of her reconstruction of her or him for long he starts to see patterns in the words and the patterns are pretty to him and distract him it is well known that lightning is attracted to body heat a person on horseback or a large saguaro the way a racket of birds in the morning is a kind of empathy for two people if we retain the belief that her image of him or her let ’ s say him is a pre-requisite for gaining consciousness of the unknown person we suppose there is no direct channel of communication to the unknown person with the result that facts about him or her must exit into the world before a life can be perceived between the light and dark of function or the object and desire or the image at any time one can turn into its opposite like desire or a screen and the object or her story and him who does not so much convey an image as a background to the biography so he says she must emphasize references and conditions of her own life over its memories or what she sees of the landscape by the manner of its illumination unless she says it is illuminated within the arms of a great cottonwood yellow or green a faith of imaginary or real connotation repeating itself from him like alternating current or radioactive dirt being turned up that registers on her without marking her 4 her persistent observation even after the frost is of each leaf coinciding with its luminousness because of its structure as a lighted space and which shows brightness in idea and form so you have to maintain your own consciousness in order not to be unconscious with me even if we can uniquely bridge the gap between the fact of a frost and the value of luminousness and even though these intrinsic properties of the plant may not be what it feels what it feels may be a space with pillars so with light the space extends as in what you believe to live with a belief is a word-like object you can focus your attention on it down to a point like desire or memory of a strong feeling you have a certain amount of control over your feeling about general human help by changing what you believe which embodies the memories your speech is empowered to represent she says space is material but seems to open up a beyond which is thought to defy material in its failure to speak its content it still cues this content by links or desires as to a form of physical appearance to the extent that she can reconstruct a context or pornography in her body suitable for a hanged woman a contingency is beaten back critically in the sense that events happening at the same time are meaningful but not connected there are events which mean nothing though there is something to mean this is an easy way to expect with desire from moment to moment while the woman was hanging herself as if consistency and the quest for certainty were not emotional as when a person begins telling a story leaves move he believed that when a life is valuable there is further value when it is responded to as valuable but this could occur through evaluative judgement without his attendant emotion the product is in one case consistent manners in the other beautiful manners
there lies a somnolent lake under a noiseless sky where never the mornings break nor the evenings die mad flakes of colour whirl on its even face iridescent and streaked with pallour and warding the silent place the rocks rise sheer and gray from the sedgeless brink to the sky dull-lit with the light of pale half-day thro ’ a void space and dry and the hours lag dead in the air with a sense of coming eternity to the heart of the lonely boatman there that boatman am i i in my lonely boat a waif on the somnolent lake watching the colours creep and float with the sinuous track of a snake now i lean o ’ er the side and lazy shades in the water see lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tide crawled in from the living sea and next i fix mine eyes so long that the heart declines on the changeless face of the open skies where no star shines and now to the rocks i turn to the rocks around that lie like walls of a circling sun wherein lie bound the waters that feel my powerless strength and meet my homeless oar labouring over their ashen length never to find a shore but the gleam still skims at times on the somnolent lake and a light there is that swims with the whirl of a snake and tho ’ dead be the hours i ’ the air and dayless the sky the heart is alive of the boatman there that boatman am i

i “ there is a thorn—it looks so old in truth you ’ d find it hard to say how it could ever have been young it looks so old and grey not higher than a two years child it stands erect this aged thorn no leaves it has no prickly points it is a mass of knotted joints a wretched thing forlorn it stands erect and like a stone with lichens is it overgrown ii “ like rock or stone it is o ’ ergrown with lichens to the very top and hung with heavy tufts of moss a melancholy crop up from the earth these mosses creep and this poor thorn they clasp it round so close you ’ d say that they are bent with plain and manifest intent to drag it to the ground and all have joined in one endeavour to bury this poor thorn for ever iii “ high on a mountain ’ s highest ridge where oft the stormy winter gale cuts like a scythe while through the clouds it sweeps from vale to vale not five yards from the mountain path this thorn you on your left espy and to the left three yards beyond you see a little muddy pond of water—never dry though but of compass small and bare to thirsty suns and parching air iv “ and close beside this aged thorn there is a fresh and lovely sight a beauteous heap a hill of moss just half a foot in height all lovely colours there you see all colours that were ever seen and mossy network too is there as if by hand of lady fair the work had woven been and cups the darlings of the eye so deep is their vermilion dye v “ ah me what lovely tints are there of olive green and scarlet bright in spikes in branches and in stars green red and pearly white this heap of earth o ’ ergrown with moss which close beside the thorn you see so fresh in all its beauteous dyes is like an infant ’ s grave in size as like as like can be but never never any where an infant ’ s grave was half so fair vi “ now would you see this aged thorn this pond and beauteous hill of moss you must take care and choose your time the mountain when to cross for oft there sits between the heap so like an infant ’ s grave in size and that same pond of which i spoke a woman in a scarlet cloak and to herself she cries ‘ ﻿oh misery oh misery oh woe is me oh misery ’ vii “ at all times of the day and night this wretched woman thither goes and she is known to every star and every wind that blows and there beside the thorn she sits when the blue daylight ’ s in the skies and when the whirlwind ’ s on the hill or frosty air is keen and still and to herself she cries ‘ ﻿oh misery oh misery oh woe is me oh misery ’ ” viii “ now wherefore thus by day and night in rain in tempest and in snow thus to the dreary mountain-top does this poor woman go and why sits she beside the thorn when the blue daylight ’ s in the sky or when the whirlwind ’ s on the hill or frosty air is keen and still and wherefore does she cry — o wherefore wherefore tell me why does she repeat that doleful cry ” ix “ i can not tell i wish i could for the true reason no one knows but would you gladly view the spot the spot to which she goes the hillock like an infant ’ s grave the pond—and thorn so old and grey pass by her door— ’ tis seldom shut— and if you see her in her hut— then to the spot away i never heard of such as dare approach the spot when she is there. ” x “ but wherefore to the mountain-top can this unhappy woman go whatever star is in the skies whatever wind may blow ” “ full twenty years are past and gone since she her name is martha ray gave with a maiden ’ s true good-will her company to stephen hill and she was blithe and gay while friends and kindred all approved of him whom tenderly she loved xi “ and they had fixed the wedding day the morning that must wed them both but stephen to another maid had sworn another oath and with this other maid to church unthinking stephen went— poor martha on that woeful day a pang of pitiless dismay into her soul was sent a fire was kindled in her breast which might not burn itself to rest xii “ they say full six months after this while yet the summer leaves were green she to the mountain-top would go and there was often seen what could she seek —or wish to hide her state to any eye was plain she was with child and she was mad yet often was she sober sad from her exceeding pain o guilty father—would that death had saved him from that breach of faith xiii “ sad case for such a brain to hold communion with a stirring child sad case as you may think for one who had a brain so wild last christmas-eve we talked of this and grey-haired wilfred of the glen held that the unborn infant wrought about its mother ’ s heart and brought her senses back again and when at last her time drew near her looks were calm her senses clear xiv “ more know i not i wish i did and it should all be told to you for what became of this poor child no mortal ever knew nay—if a child to her was born no earthly tongue could ever tell and if ’ twas born alive or dead far less could this with proof be said but some remember well that martha ray about this time would up the mountain often climb xv “ and all that winter when at night the wind blew from the mountain-peak ’ twas worth your while though in the dark the churchyard path to seek for many a time and oft were heard cries coming from the mountain head some plainly living voices were and others i ’ ve heard many swear were voices of the dead i can not think whate ’ er they say they had to do with martha ray xvi “ but that she goes to this old thorn the thorn which i described to you and there sits in a scarlet cloak i will be sworn is true for one day with my telescope to view the ocean wide and bright when to this country first i came ere i had heard of martha ’ s name i climbed the mountain ’ s height — a storm came on and i could see no object higher than my knee xvii “ ’ twas mist and rain and storm and rain no screen no fence could i discover and then the wind in sooth it was a wind full ten times over i looked around i thought i saw a jutting crag —and off i ran head-foremost through the driving rain the shelter of the crag to gain and as i am a man instead of jutting crag i found a woman seated on the ground xviii “ i did not speak—i saw her face her face —it was enough for me i turned about and heard her cry ‘ ﻿oh misery oh misery ’ and there she sits until the moon through half the clear blue sky will go and when the little breezes make the waters of the pond to shake as all the country know she shudders and you hear her cry ‘ ﻿oh misery oh misery ’ ” xix “ but what ’ s the thorn and what the pond and what the hill of moss to her and what the creeping breeze that comes the little pond to stir ” “ i can not tell but some will say she hanged her baby on the tree some say she drowned it in the pond which is a little step beyond but all and each agree the little babe was buried there beneath that hill of moss so fair xx “ i ’ ve heard the moss is spotted red with drops of that poor infant ’ s blood but kill a new-born infant thus i do not think she could some say if to the pond you go and fix on it a steady view the shadow of a babe you trace a baby and a baby ’ s face and that it looks at you whene ’ er you look on it ’ tis plain the baby looks at you again xxi “ and some had sworn an oath that she should be to public justice brought and for the little infant ’ s bones with spades they would have sought but instantly the hill of moss before their eyes began to stir and for full fifty yards around the grass—it shook upon the ground yet all do still aver the little babe lies buried there beneath that hill of moss so fair xxii “ i can not tell how this may be but plain it is the thorn is bound with heavy tufts of moss that strive to drag it to the ground and this i know full many a time when she was on the mountain high by day and in the silent night when all the stars shone clear and bright that i have heard her cry ‘ ﻿oh misery oh misery oh woe is me oh misery ’ ”
beyond the field of grazing gazing cows the great bull has a pasture to himself monumental black flanks barely twitching from the swarming flies only a few strands of wire separate us—how could i forget my childhood terror the grownups warning that the old bull near my uncle ’ s farm would love to chase me stomp me gore me if i ever got too close and so i skirted acres just to keep my distance peeking through the leaves to see if he still was watching me waiting for some foolish move— those fierce red eyes the thunder in the ground— or maybe that was simply nightmares it ’ s getting hard to tell as years themselves keep gaining ground relentlessly their hot breath on my back and not a fence in sight
september was when it began locusts dying in the fields our dogs silent moving like shadows on a wall and strange worms crawling flies of a kind we had never seen before huge vineyard moths badgers and snakes abandoning their holes in the field the fruit gone rotten queer fungi sprouting the fields and woods covered with spiderwebs black vapors rising from the earth all these and more began that fall ravens flew round the hospital in pairs where there was water we could hear the sound of beating clothes all through the night we could not count all the miscarriages the quarrels the jealousies and one day in a field i saw a swarm of frogs swollen and hideous hundreds upon hundreds sitting on each other huddled together silent ominous and heard the sound of rushing wind
there ’ s a farm auction up the road wind has its bid in for the leaves already bugs flurry the headlights between cornfields at night if this world were permanent i could dance full as the squaw dress on the clothesline i would not see winter in the square of white yard-light on the wall but something tugs at me the world is at a loss and i am part of it migrating daily everything is up for grabs like a box of farm tools broken open i hear the spirits often in the garden and along the shore of corn i know this place is not mine i hear them up the road again this world is a horizon an open sea behind the house the white iceberg of the barn

when he read in the obituary section that he was dead the famous author was at first amused and flattered they love me so much he thought they have imagined me dead because they fear the loss of my genius above all else so he put on his hat combed his goatee to a waxed point and sauntered out of his flat to attend his own funeral how literary he thought like huck finn and everyone will be weeping he was perturbed however when he found that the funeral home was in a bad section of town next to a tattoo parlor named the desultory slut he walked in past the unmanned front desk to a back room of frayed velvet and gilt columns where his coffin was on display a faux mahogany monstrosity with painted pewter handles the only people in attendance were four young professors from the local college with leather patches on the elbows of their ill-fitting tweed jackets and long cruel faces of foxes and rats he recognized one of them a gangly fellow with pimply cheeks who had shaken his hand after his last reading and reverently asked for his signature do you have one of my books to sign the author had asked oh no the young professor had cried baring his hairless chest can you please sign here now the pimply fellow was sitting in a pew whispering loudly to his neighbor isn ’ t it great he said the old bastard finally kicked his neighbor nodded silently deeply disturbed but well aware of the dramatic potential of the moment the author took this as his cue to step boldly into the room with a loud ta daaa for some reason the professors ignored him and continued their whispering for a moment he was afflicted with a strange vertigo and stood like a clay golem without a will of his own then a sudden rage took him and the author snapped out of the spell and strode to the front of the room waving his arms wait i ’ m not dead at all here i am it was all a mistake he cried but the professors did not see him in fact one walked right through him as if he were merely a ghost or spirit and rushed up to the coffin do you realize what this means the professor cried this means we ’ re free and he grabbed the body in the coffin and dragged it to the floor the shocked author saw in the body his own likeness lips and cheeks rouged into a grotesque semblance of life he ’ s dead he ’ s dead our enemy is finally dead they chanted in a frenzy and the professors began trampling on the corpse weeping with joy and relief

the well-braced craft then moved o ’ er the waters by might of the wind that bark like a bird with breast of foam till in season due on the second day the curved prow such course had run that sailors now could see the land sea-cliffs shining steep high hills headlands broad their haven was found their journey ended up then quickly the weders ’ clansmen climbed ashore anchored their sea-wood with armor clashing and gear of battle god they thanked for passing in peace o ’ er the paths of the sea now saw from the cliff a scylding clansman a warden that watched the water-side how they bore o ’ er the gangway glittering shields war-gear in readiness wonder seized him to know what manner of men they were straight to the strand his steed he rode hrothgar ’ s henchman with hand of might he shook his spear and spake in parley “ who are ye then ye armed men mailed folk that yon mighty vessel have urged thus over the ocean ways here o ’ er the waters a warden i sentinel set o ’ er the sea-march

then shone the boars over the cheek-guard chased with gold keen and gleaming guard it kept o ’ er the man of war as marched along heroes in haste till the hall they saw broad of gable and bright with gold that was the fairest ‘ mid folk of earth of houses ‘ neath heaven where hrothgar lived and the gleam of it lightened o ’ er lands afar the sturdy shieldsman showed that bright burg-of-the-boldest bade them go straightway thither his steed then turned hardy hero and hailed them thus — “ tis time that i fare from you father almighty in grace and mercy guard you well safe in your seekings seaward i go ‘ gainst hostile warriors hold my watch. ” stone-bright the street it showed the way to the crowd of clansmen corselets glistened hand-forged hard on their harness bright the steel ring sang as they strode along in mail of battle and marched to the hall there weary of ocean the wall along they set their bucklers their broad shields down and bowed them to bench the breastplates clanged war-gear of men their weapons stacked spears of the seafarers stood together gray-tipped ash that iron band was worthily weaponed — a warrior proud asked of the heroes their home and kin “ whence now bear ye burnished shields harness gray and helmets grim spears in multitude messenger i hrothgar ’ s herald heroes so many ne ’ er met i as strangers of mood so strong ‘ tis plain that for prowess not plunged into exile for high-hearted valor hrothgar ye seek ” him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words proud earl of the weders answer made hardy ‘ neath helmet — ” hygelac ’ s we fellows at board i am beowulf named i am seeking to say to the son of healfdene this mission of mine to thy master-lord the doughty prince if he deign at all grace that we greet him the good one now. ” wulfgar spake the wendles ’ chieftain whose might of mind to many was known his courage and counsel “ the king of danes the scyldings ’ friend i fain will tell the breaker-of-rings as the boon thou askest the famed prince of thy faring hither and swiftly after such answer bring as the doughty monarch may deign to give. ” hied then in haste to where hrothgar sat white-haired and old his earls about him till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there of the danish king good courtier he wulfgar spake to his winsome lord — “ hither have fared to thee far-come men o ’ er the paths of ocean people of geatland and the stateliest there by his sturdy band is beowulf named this boon they seek that they my master may with thee have speech at will nor spurn their prayer to give them hearing gracious hrothgar in weeds of the warrior worthy they methinks of our liking their leader most surely a hero that hither his henchmen has led. ” hrothgar answered helmet of scyldings — “ i knew him of yore in his youthful days his aged father was ecgtheow named to whom at home gave hrethel the geat his only daughter their offspring bold fares hither to seek the steadfast friend and seamen too have said me this — who carried my gifts to the geatish court thither for thanks — he has thirty men ’ s heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand the bold-in-battle blessed god out of his mercy this man hath sent to danes of the west as i ween indeed against horror of grendel i hope to give the good youth gold for his gallant thought be thou in haste and bid them hither clan of kinsmen to come before me and add this word — they are welcome guests to folk of the danes. ” to the door of the hall wulfgar went and the word declared — “ to you this message my master sends east-danes ’ king that your kin he knows hardy

war-shafts wait its end. ” uprose the mighty one ringed with his men brave band of thanes some bode without battle-gear guarding as bade the chief then hied that troop where the herald led them under heorot ’ s roof the hero strode hardy ‘ neath helm till the hearth he neared beowulf spake — his breastplate gleamed war-net woven by wit of the smith — “ thou hrothgar hail hygelac ’ s i kinsman and follower fame a plenty have i gained in youth these grendel-deeds i heard in my home-land heralded clear seafarers say how stands this hall of buildings best for your band of thanes empty and idle when evening sun in the harbor of heaven is hidden away so my vassals advised me well — brave and wise the best of men — o sovran hrothgar to seek thee here for my nerve and my might they knew full well themselves had seen me from slaughter come blood-flecked from foes where five i bound and that wild brood worsted i ’ the waves i slew nicors by night in need and peril avenging the weders whose woe they sought — crushing the grim ones grendel now monster cruel be mine to quell in single battle so from thee thou sovran of the shining-danes scyldings ’ -bulwark a boon i seek — and friend-of-the-folk refuse it not o warriors ’ -shield now i ’ ve wandered far — that i alone with my liegemen here this hardy band may heorot purge more i hear that the monster dire in his wanton mood of weapons recks not hence shall i scorn — so hygelac stay king of my kindred kind to me — brand or buckler to bear in the fight gold-colored targe but with gripe alone must i front the fiend and fight for life foe against foe then faith be his in the doom of the lord whom death shall take fain i ween if the fight he win in this hall of gold my geatish band will he fearless eat — as oft before — my noblest thanes nor need ’ st thou then to hide my head for his shall i be dyed in gore if death must take me and my blood-covered body he ’ ll bear as prey ruthless devour it the roamer-lonely

and work of wayland fares wyrd as she must. ” hrothgar spake the scyldings ’ -helmet — “ for fight defensive friend my beowulf to succor and save thou hast sought us here thy father ’ s combat a feud enkindled when heatholaf with hand he slew among the wylfings his weder kin for horror of fighting feared to hold him fleeing he sought our south-dane folk over surge of ocean the honor-scyldings when

when the daylight broke all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled gory the hall i had heroes the less doughty dear-ones that death had reft — but sit to the banquet unbind thy words hardy hero as heart shall prompt thee. ” gathered together the geatish men in the banquet-hall on bench assigned sturdy-spirited sat them down hardy-hearted a henchman attended carried the carven cup in hand served the clear mead oft minstrels sang blithe in heorot heroes revelled no dearth of warriors weder and dane unferth spake the son of ecglaf who sat at the feet of the scyldings ’ lord unbound the battle-runes — beowulf ’ s quest sturdy seafarer ’ s sorely galled him ever he envied that other men should more achieve in middle-earth of fame under heaven than he himself — “ art thou that beowulf breca ’ s rival who emulous swam on the open sea when for pride the pair of you proved the floods and wantonly dared in waters deep to risk your lives no living man or lief or loath from your labor dire could you dissuade from swimming the main ocean-tides with your arms ye covered with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured swam o ’ er the waters winter ’ s storm rolled the rough waves in

brave hast been in struggle grim — if grendel ’ s approach thou darst await through the watch of night ” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ what a deal hast uttered dear my unferth drunken with beer of breca now told of his triumph truth i claim it that i had more of might in the sea than any man else more ocean-endurance we twain had talked in time of youth and made our boast — we were merely boys striplings still — to stake our lives far at sea and so we performed it naked swords as we swam along we held in hand with hope to guard us against the whales not a whit from me could he float afar o ’ er the flood of waves haste o ’ er the billows nor him i abandoned together we twain on the tides abode five nights full till the flood divided us churning waves and chillest weather darkling night and the northern wind ruthless rushed on us rough was the surge now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace yet me ‘ gainst the monsters my mailed coat hard and hand-linked help afforded — battle-sark braided my breast to ward garnished with gold there grasped me firm and haled me to bottom the hated foe with grimmest gripe ‘ twas granted me though to pierce the monster with point of sword with blade of battle huge beast of the sea was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine me thus often the evil monsters thronging threatened with thrust of my sword the darling i dealt them due return nowise had they bliss from their booty then to devour their victim vengeful creatures seated to banquet at bottom of sea but at break of day by my brand sore hurt on the edge of ocean up they lay put to sleep by the sword and since by them on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk are never molested — light from east came bright god ’ s beacon the billows sank so that i saw the sea-cliffs high windy walls for wyrd oft saveth earl undoomed if he doughty be and so it came that i killed with my sword nine of the nicors of night-fought battles ne ’ er heard i a harder ‘ neath heaven ’ s

though thou wast the bane of thy brethren dear thy closest kin whence curse of hell awaits thee well as thy wit may serve for i say in sooth thou son of ecglaf never had grendel these grim deeds wrought monster dire on thy master dear in heorot such havoc if heart of thine were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud but he has found no feud will happen from sword-clash dread of your danish clan he vaunts him safe from the victor-scyldings he forces pledges favors none of the land of danes but lustily murders fights and feasts nor feud he dreads from spear-dane men but speedily now shall i prove him the prowess and pride of the geats shall bid him battle blithe to mead go he that listeth when light of dawn this morrow morning o ’ er men of earth ether-robed sun from the south shall beam ” joyous then was the jewel-giver hoar-haired war-brave help awaited the bright-danes ’ prince from beowulf hearing folk ’ s good shepherd such firm resolve then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding with winsome words came wealhtheow forth queen of hrothgar heedful of courtesy gold-decked greeting the guests in hall and the high-born lady handed the cup first to the east-danes ’ heir and warden bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse the land ’ s beloved one lustily took he banquet and beaker battle-famed king through the hall then went the helmings ’ lady to younger and older everywhere carried the cup till come the moment when the ring-graced queen the royal-hearted to beowulf bore the beaker of mead she greeted the geats ’ lord god she thanked in wisdom ’ s words that her will was granted that at last on a hero her hope could lean for comfort in terrors the cup he took hardy-in-war from wealhtheow ’ s hand and answer uttered the eager-for-combat beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ this was my thought when my thanes and i bent to the ocean and entered our boat that i would work the will of your people fully or fighting fall in death in fiend ’ s gripe fast i am firm to do an earl ’ s brave deed or end the days of this life of mine in the mead-hall here. ” well these words to the woman seemed beowulf ’ s battle-boast — bright with gold the stately dame by her spouse sat down again as erst began in hall warriors ’ wassail and words of power the proud-band ’ s revel till presently the son of healfdene hastened to seek rest for the night he knew there waited fight for the fiend in that festal hall when the sheen of the sun they saw no more and dusk of night sank darkling nigh and shadowy shapes came striding on wan under welkin the warriors rose man to man he made harangue hrothgar to beowulf bade him hail let him wield the wine hall a word he added — “ never to any man erst i trusted since i could heave up hand and shield this noble dane-hall till now to thee have now and hold this house unpeered remember thy glory thy might declare watch for the foe no wish shall fail thee if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life. ” then hrothgar went with his hero-train defence-of-scyldings forth from hall fain would the war-lord wealhtheow seek couch of his queen the king-of-glory against this grendel a guard had set so heroes heard a hall-defender who warded the monarch and watched for the monster in truth the geats ’ prince gladly trusted his mettle his might the mercy of god cast off then his corselet of iron helmet from head to his henchman gave — choicest of weapons — the well-chased sword bidding him guard the gear of battle spake then his vaunt the valiant man beowulf geat ere the bed be sought — “ of force in fight no feebler i count me in grim war-deeds than grendel deems him not with the sword then to sleep of death his life will i give though it lie in my power no skill is his to strike against me my shield to hew though he hardy be bold in battle we both this night shall spurn the sword if he seek me here unweaponed for war let wisest god sacred lord on which side soever doom decree as he deemeth right. ” reclined then the chieftain and cheek-pillows held the head of the earl while all about him seamen hardy on hall-beds sank none of them thought that thence their steps to the folk and fastness that fostered them to the land they loved would lead them back full well they wist that on warriors many battle-death seized in the banquet-hall of danish clan but comfort and help war-weal weaving to weder folk the master gave that by might of one over their enemy all prevailed by single strength in sooth ‘ tis told that highest god o ’ er human kind hath wielded ever — thro ’ wan night striding came the walker-in-shadow warriors slept whose hest was to guard the gabled hall — all save one ‘ twas widely known that against god ’ s will the ghostly ravager him could not hurl to haunts of darkness wakeful ready with warrior ’ s wrath bold he bided the battle ’ s issue then from the moorland by misty crags with god ’ s wrath laden grendel came the monster was minded of mankind now sundry to seize in the stately house under welkin he walked till the wine-palace there gold-hall of men he gladly discerned flashing with fretwork not first time this that he the home of hrothgar sought — yet ne ’ er in his life-day late or early such hardy heroes such hall-thanes found to the house the warrior walked apace parted from peace the portal opended though with forged bolts fast when his fists had struck it and baleful he burst in his blatant rage the house ’ s mouth all hastily then o ’ er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on ireful he strode there streamed from his eyes fearful flashes like flame to see he spied in hall the hero-band kin and clansmen clustered asleep hardy liegemen then laughed his heart for the monster was minded ere morn should dawn savage to sever the soul of each life from body since lusty banquet waited his will but wyrd forbade him to seize any more of men on earth after that evening eagerly watched hygelac ’ s kinsman his cursed foe how he would fare in fell attack not that the monster was minded to pause straightway he seized a sleeping warrior for the first and tore him fiercely asunder the bone-frame bit drank blood in streams swallowed him piecemeal swiftly thus the lifeless corse was clear devoured e ’ en feet and hands then farther he hied for the hardy hero with hand he grasped felt for the foe with fiendish claw for the hero reclining — who clutched it boldly prompt to answer propped on his arm soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils that never he met in this middle-world in the ways of earth another wight with heavier hand-gripe at heart he feared sorrowed in soul — none the sooner escaped fain would he flee his fastness seek the den of devils no doings now such as oft he had done in days of old then bethought him the hardy hygelac-thane of his boast at evening up he bounded grasped firm his foe whose fingers cracked the fiend made off but the earl close followed the monster meant — if he might at all — to fling himself free and far away fly to the fens — knew his fingers ’ power in the gripe of the grim one gruesome march to heorot this monster of harm had made din filled the room the danes were bereft castle-dwellers and clansmen all earls of their ale angry were both those savage hall-guards the house resounded wonder it was the wine-hall firm in the strain of their struggle stood to earth the fair house fell not too fast it was within and without by its iron bands craftily clamped though there crashed from sill many a mead-bench — men have told me — gay with gold where the grim foes wrestled so well had weened the wisest scyldings that not ever at all might any man that bone-decked brave house break asunder crush by craft — unless clasp of fire in smoke engulfed it — again uprose din redoubled danes of the north with fear and frenzy were filled each one who from the wall that wailing heard god ’ s foe sounding his grisly song cry of the conquered clamorous pain from captive of hell too closely held him he who of men in might was strongest in that same day of this our life not in any wise would the earls ’ -defence suffer that slaughterous stranger to live useless deeming his days and years to men on earth now many an earl of beowulf brandished blade ancestral fain the life of their lord to shield their praised prince if power were theirs never they knew — as they neared the foe hardy-hearted heroes of war aiming their swords on every side the accursed to kill — no keenest blade no farest of falchions fashioned on earth could harm or hurt that hideous fiend he was safe by his spells from sword of battle from edge of iron yet his end and parting on that same day of this our life woful should be and his wandering soul far off flit to the fiends ’ domain soon he found who in former days harmful in heart and hated of god on many a man such murder wrought that the frame of his body failed him now for him the keen-souled kinsman of hygelac held in hand hateful alive was each to other the outlaw dire took mortal hurt a mighty wound showed on his shoulder and sinews cracked and the bone-frame burst to beowulf now the glory was given and grendel thence death-sick his den in the dark moor sought noisome abode he knew too well that here was the last of life an end of his days on earth — to all the danes by that bloody battle the boon had come from ravage had rescued the roving stranger hrothgar ’ s hall the hardy and wise one had purged it anew his night-work pleased him his deed and its honor to eastern danes had the valiant geat his vaunt made good all their sorrow and ills assuaged their bale of battle borne so long and all the dole they erst endured pain a-plenty — ‘ twas proof of this when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down arm and shoulder — all indeed of grendel ’ s gripe — ‘ neath the gabled roof ’ many at morning as men have told me warriors gathered the gift-hall round folk-leaders faring from far and near o ’ er wide-stretched ways the wonder to view trace of the traitor not troublous seemed the enemy ’ s end to any man who saw by the gait of the graceless foe how the weary-hearted away from thence baffled in battle and banned his steps death-marked dragged to the devils ’ mere bloody the billows were boiling there turbid the tide of tumbling waves horribly seething with sword-blood hot by that doomed one dyed who in den of the moor laid forlorn his life adown his heathen soul -and hell received it home then rode the hoary clansmen from that merry journey and many a youth on horses white the hardy warriors back from the mere then beowulf ’ s glory eager they echoed and all averred that from sea to sea or south or north there was no other in earth ’ s domain under vault of heaven more valiant found of warriors none more worthy to rule on their lord beloved they laid no slight gracious hrothgar a good king he from time to time the tried-in-battle their gray steeds set to gallop amain and ran a race when the road seemed fair from time to time a thane of the king who had made many vaunts and was mindful of verses stored with sagas and songs of old bound word to word in well-knit rime welded his lay this warrior soon of beowulf ’ s quest right cleverly sang and artfully added an excellent tale in well-ranged words of the warlike deeds he had heard in saga of sigemund strange the story he said it all — the waelsing ’ s wanderings wide his struggles which never were told to tribes of men the feuds and the frauds save to fitela only when of these doings he deigned to speak uncle to nephew as ever the twain stood side by side in stress of war and multitude of the monster kind they had felled with their swords of sigemund grew when he passed from life no little praise for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed that herded the hoard under hoary rock the atheling dared the deed alone fearful quest nor was fitela there yet so it befell his falchion pierced that wondrous worm — on the wall it struck best blade the dragon died in its blood thus had the dread-one by daring achieved over the ring-hoard to rule at will himself to pleasure a sea-boat he loaded and bore on its bosom the beaming gold son of waels the worm was consumed he had of all heroes the highest renown among races of men this refuge-of-warriors for deeds of daring that decked his name since the hand and heart of heremod grew slack in battle he swiftly banished to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes to death was betrayed for torrents of sorrow had lamed him too long a load of care to earls and athelings all he proved oft indeed in earlier days for the warrior ’ s wayfaring wise men mourned who had hoped of him help from harm and bale and had thought their sovran ’ s son would thrive follow his father his folk protect the hoard and the stronghold heroes ’ land home of scyldings — but here thanes said the kinsman of hygelac kinder seemed to all the other was urged to crime and afresh to the race the fallow roads by swift steeds measured the morning sun was climbing higher clansmen hastened to the high-built hall those hardy-minded the wonder to witness warden of treasure crowned with glory the king himself with stately band from the bride-bower strode and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens measured the path to the mead-house fair hrothgar spake — to the hall he went stood by the steps the steep roof saw garnished with gold and grendel ’ s hand — “ for the sight i see to the sovran ruler be speedy thanks a throng of sorrows i have borne from grendel but god still works wonder on wonder the warden-of-glory it was but now that i never more for woes that weighed on me waited help long as i lived when laved in blood stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house — widespread woe for wise men all who had no hope to hinder ever foes infernal and fiendish sprites from havoc in hall this hero now by the wielder ’ s might a work has done that not all of us erst could ever do by wile and wisdom lo well can she say whoso of women this warrior bore among sons of men if still she liveth that the god of the ages was good to her in the birth of her bairn now beowulf thee of heroes best i shall heartily love as mine own my son preserve thou ever this kinship new thou shalt never lack wealth of the world that i wield as mine full oft for less have i largess showered my precious hoard on a punier man less stout in struggle thyself hast now fulfilled such deeds that thy fame shall endure through all the ages as ever he did well may the wielder reward thee still ” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ this work of war most willingly we have fought this fight and fearlessly dared force of the foe fain too were i hadst thou but seen himself what time the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall swiftly i thought in strongest gripe on his bed of death to bind him down that he in the hent of this hand of mine should breathe his last but he broke away him i might not — the maker willed not — hinder from flight and firm enough hold the life-destroyer too sturdy was he the ruthless in running for rescue however he left behind him his hand in pledge arm and shoulder nor aught of help could the cursed one thus procure at all none the longer liveth he loathsome fiend sunk in his sins but sorrow holds him tightly grasped in gripe of anguish in baleful bonds where bide he must evil outlaw such awful doom as the mighty maker shall mete him out. ” more silent seemed the son of ecglaf in boastful speech of his battle-deeds since athelings all through the earl ’ s great prowess beheld that hand on the high roof gazing foeman ’ s fingers — the forepart of each of the sturdy nails to steel was likest — heathen ’ s “ hand-spear ” hostile warrior ’ s claw uncanny ‘ twas clear they said that him no blade of the brave could touch how keen soever or cut away that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe there was hurry and hest in heorot now for hands to bedeck it and dense was the throng of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse the guest-room to garnish gold-gay shone the hangings that were wove on the wall and wonders many to delight each mortal that looks upon them though braced within by iron bands that building bright was broken sorely rent were its hinges the roof alone held safe and sound when seared with crime the fiendish foe his flight essayed of life despairing — no light thing that the flight for safety — essay it who will forced of fate he shall find his way to the refuge ready for race of man for soul-possessors and sons of earth and there his body on bed of death shall rest after revel arrived was the hour when to hall proceeded healfdene ’ s son the king himself would sit to banquet ne ’ er heard i of host in haughtier throng more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory fain of the feasting featly received many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall hrothgar and hrothulf heorot now was filled with friends the folk of scyldings ne ’ er yet had tried the traitor ’ s deed to beowulf gave the bairn of healfdene a gold-wove banner guerdon of triumph broidered battle-flag breastplate and helmet and a splendid sword was seen of many borne to the brave one beowulf took cup in hall for such costly gifts he suffered no shame in that soldier throng for i heard of few heroes in heartier mood with four such gifts so fashioned with gold on the ale-bench honoring others thus o ’ er the roof of the helmet high a ridge wound with wires kept ward o ’ er the head lest the relict-of-files should fierce invade sharp in the strife when that shielded hero should go to grapple against his foes then the earls ’ -defence on the floor bade lead coursers eight with carven head-gear adown the hall one horse was decked with a saddle all shining and set in jewels ‘ twas the battle-seat of the best of kings when to play of swords the son of healfdene was fain to fare ne ’ er failed his valor in the crush of combat when corpses fell to beowulf over them both then gave the refuge-of-ingwines right and power o ’ er war-steeds and weapons wished him joy of them manfully thus the mighty prince hoard-guard for heroes that hard fight repaid with steeds and treasures contemned by none who is willing to say the sooth aright and the lord of earls to each that came with beowulf over the briny ways an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave precious gift and the price bade pay in gold for him whom grendel erst murdered — and fain of them more had killed had not wisest god their wyrd averted and the man ’ s brave mood the maker then ruled human kind as here and now therefore is insight always best and forethought of mind how much awaits him of lief and of loath who long time here through days of warfare this world endures then song and music mingled sounds in the presence of healfdene ’ s head-of-armies and harping was heard with the hero-lay as hrothgar ’ s singer the hall-joy woke along the mead-seats making his song of that sudden raid on the sons of finn healfdene ’ s hero hnaef the scylding was fated to fall in the frisian slaughter hildeburh needed not hold in value her enemies ’ honor innocent both were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play bairn and brother they bowed to fate stricken by spears ‘ twas a

malice of mind bemoan themselves as forced to follow their fee-giver ’ s slayer lordless men as their lot ordained should frisian moreover with foeman ’ s taunt that murderous hatred to mind recall then edge of the sword must seal his doom oaths were given and ancient gold heaped from hoard — the hardy scylding battle-thane best on his balefire lay all on the pyre were plain to see the gory sark the gilded swine-crest boar of hard iron and athelings many slain by the sword at the slaughter they fell it was hildeburh ’ s hest at hnaef ’ s own pyre the bairn of her body on brands to lay his bones to burn on the balefire placed at his uncle ’ s side in sorrowful dirges bewept them the woman great wailing ascended then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires roared o ’ er the hillock

roaming the deep and how to hasten the hot encounter where sons of the frisians were sure to be so he escaped not the common doom when hun with “ lafing ” the light-of-battle best of blades his bosom pierced its edge was famed with the frisian earls on fierce-heart finn there fell likewise on himself at home the horrid sword-death for guthlaf and oslaf of grim attack had sorrowing told from

royal to rest the room was guarded by an army of earls as erst was done they bared the bench-boards abroad they spread beds and bolsters — one beer-carouser in danger of doom lay down in the hall — at their heads they set their shields of war bucklers bright on the bench were there over each atheling easy to see the high battle-helmet the haughty spear the corselet of rings ‘ twas their custom so ever to be for battle prepared at home or harrying which it were even as oft as evil threatened their sovran king — they were clansmen good then sank they to sleep with sorrow one bought his rest of

heorot found a warrior watching and waiting the fray with whom the grisly one grappled amain but the man remembered his mighty power the glorious gift that god had sent him in his maker ’ s mercy put his trust for comfort and help so he conquered the foe felled the fiend who fled abject reft of joy to the realms of death mankind ’ s foe and his mother now gloomy and grim would go that quest of sorrow the death of her son to avenge to heorot came she where helmeted danes slept in the hall too soon came back old ills of the earls when in she burst the mother of grendel less grim though that terror e ’ en as terror of woman in war is less might of maid than of men in arms when hammer-forged the falchion hard sword gore-stained through swine of the helm crested with keen blade carves amain then was in hall the hard-edge drawn the swords on the settles and shields a-many firm held in hand nor helmet minded nor harness of mail whom that horror seized haste was hers she would hie afar and save her life when the liegemen saw her yet a single atheling up she seized fast and firm as she fled to the moor he was for hrothgar of heroes the dearest of trusty vassals betwixt the seas whom she killed on his couch a clansman famous in battle brave — nor was beowulf there another house had been held apart after giving of gold for the geat renowned — uproar filled heorot the hand all had viewed blood-flecked she bore with her bale was returned dole in the dwellings ‘ twas dire exchange where dane and geat were doomed to give the lives of loved ones long-tried king the hoary hero at heart was sad when he knew his noble no more lived and dead indeed was his dearest thane to his bower was beowulf brought in haste dauntless victor as daylight broke along with his earls the atheling lord with his clansmen came where the king abode waiting to see if the wielder-of-all would turn this tale of trouble and woe strode o ’ er floor the famed-in-strife with his hand-companions — the hall resounded — wishing to greet the wise old king ingwines ’ lord he asked if the night had passed in peace to the prince ’ s mind hrothgar spake helmet-of-scyldings — “ ask not of pleasure pain is renewed to danish folk dead is aeschere of yrmenlaf the elder brother my sage adviser and stay in council shoulder-comrade in stress of fight when warriors clashed and we warded our heads hewed the helm-boars hero famed should be every earl as aeschere was but here in heorot a hand hath slain him of wandering death-sprite i wot not whither proud of the prey her path she took fain of her fill the feud she avenged that yesternight unyieldingly grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst — seeing how long these liegemen mine he ruined and ravaged reft of life in arms he fell now another comes keen and cruel her kin to avenge faring far in feud of blood so that many a thane shall think who e ’ er sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings this is hardest of heart-bales the hand lies low that once was willing each wish to please land-dwellers here and liegemen mine who house by those parts i have heard relate that such a pair they have sometimes seen march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting wandering spirits one of them seemed so far as my folk could fairly judge of womankind and one accursed in man ’ s guise trod the misery-track of exile though huger than human bulk grendel in days long gone they named him folk of the land his father they knew not nor any brood that was born to him of treacherous spirits untrod is their home by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands fenways fearful where flows the stream from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks underground flood not far is it hence in measure of miles that the mere expands and o ’ er it the frost-bound forest hanging sturdily rooted shadows the wave by night is a wonder weird to see fire on the waters so wise lived none of the sons of men to search those depths nay though the heath-rover harried by dogs the horn-proud hart this holt should seek long distance driven his dear life first on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge to hide his head ‘ tis no happy place thence the welter of waters washes up wan to welkin when winds bestir evil storms and air grows dusk and the heavens weep now is help once more with thee alone the land thou knowst not place of fear where thou findest out that sin-flecked being seek if thou dare i will reward thee for waging this fight with ancient treasure as erst i did with winding gold if thou winnest back. ” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “ sorrow not sage it beseems us better friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them each of us all must his end abide in the ways of the world so win who may glory ere death when his days are told that is the warrior ’ s worthiest doom rise o realm-warder ride we anon and mark the trail of the mother of grendel no harbor shall hide her — heed my promise — enfolding of field or forested mountain or floor of the flood let her flee where she will but thou this day endure in patience as i ween thou wilt thy woes each one. ” leaped up the graybeard god he thanked mighty lord for the man ’ s brave words for hrothgar soon a horse was saddled wave-maned steed the sovran wise stately rode on his shield-armed men followed in force the footprints led along the woodland widely seen a path o ’ er the plain where she passed and trod the murky moor of men-at-arms she bore the bravest and best one dead him who with hrothgar the homestead ruled on then went the atheling-born o ’ er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles narrow passes and unknown ways headlands sheer and the haunts of the nicors foremost he fared a few at his side of the wiser men the ways to scan till he found in a flash the forested hill hanging over the hoary rock a woful wood the waves below were dyed in blood the danish men had sorrow of soul and for scyldings all for many a hero ‘ twas hard to bear ill for earls when aeschere ’ s head they found by the flood on the foreland there waves were welling the warriors saw hot with blood but the horn sang oft battle-song bold the band sat down and watched on the water worm-like things sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness — such as oft essay at hour of morn on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest — and sea-snakes and monsters these started away swollen and savage that song to hear that war-horn ’ s blast the warden of geats with bolt from bow then balked of life of wave-work one monster amid its heart went the keen war-shaft in water it seemed less doughty in swimming whom death had seized swift on the billows with boar-spears well hooked and barbed it was hard beset done to death and dragged on the headland wave-roamer wondrous warriors viewed the grisly guest then girt him beowulf in martial mail nor mourned for his life his breastplate broad and bright of hues woven by hand should the waters try well could it ward the warrior ’ s body that battle should break on his breast in vain nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe and the helmet white that his head protected was destined to dare the deeps of the flood through wave-whirl win ‘ twas wound with chains decked with gold as in days of yore the weapon-smith worked it wondrously with swine-forms set it that swords nowise brandished in battle could bite that helm nor was that the meanest of mighty helps which hrothgar ’ s orator offered at need “ hrunting ” they named the hilted sword of old-time heirlooms easily first iron was its edge all etched with poison with battle-blood hardened nor blenched it at fight in hero ’ s hand who held it ever on paths of peril prepared to go to folkstead of foes not first time this it was destined to do a daring task for he bore not in mind the bairn of ecglaf sturdy and strong that speech he had made drunk with wine now this weapon he lent to a stouter swordsman himself though durst not under welter of waters wager his life as loyal liegeman so lost he his glory honor of earls with the other not so who girded him now for the grim encounter beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ have mind thou honored offspring of healfdene gold-friend of men now i go on this quest sovran wise what once was said if in thy cause it came that i should lose my life thou wouldst loyal bide to me though fallen in father ’ s place be guardian thou to this group of my thanes my warrior-friends if war should seize me and the goodly gifts thou gavest me hrothgar beloved to hygelac send geatland ’

sword earl far-honored this heirloom precious hard of edge with hrunting i seek doom of glory or death shall take me. ” after these words the weder-geat lord boldly hastened biding never answer at all the ocean floods closed o ’ er the hero long while of the day fled ere he felt the floor of the sea soon found the fiend who the flood-domain sword-hungry held these hundred winters greedy and grim that some guest from above some man was raiding her monster-realm she grasped out for him with grisly claws and the warrior seized yet scathed she not his body hale the breastplate hindered as she strove to shatter the sark of war the linked harness with loathsome hand then bore this brine-wolf when bottom she touched the lord of rings to the lair she haunted whiles vainly he strove though his valor held weapon to wield against wondrous monsters that sore beset him sea-beasts many tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail and swarmed on the stranger but soon he marked he was now in some hall he knew not which where water never could work him harm nor through the roof could reach him ever fangs of the flood firelight he saw beams of a blaze that brightly shone then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep mere-wife monstrous for mighty stroke he swung his blade and the blow withheld not then sang on her head that seemly blade its war-song wild but the warrior found the light-of-battle was loath to bite to harm the heart its hard edge failed the noble at need yet had known of old strife hand to hand and had helmets cloven doomed men ’ s fighting-gear first time this for the gleaming blade that its glory fell firm still stood nor failed in valor heedful of high deeds hygelac ’ s kinsman flung away fretted sword featly jewelled the angry earl on earth it lay steel-edged and stiff his strength he trusted hand-gripe of might so man shall do whenever in war he weens to earn him lasting fame nor fears for his life seized then by shoulder shrank not from combat the geatish war-prince grendel ’ s mother flung then the fierce one filled with wrath his deadly foe that she fell to ground swift on her part she paid him back with grisly grasp and grappled with him spent with struggle stumbled the warrior fiercest of fighting-men fell adown on the hall-guest she hurled herself hent her short sword broad and brown-edged the bairn to avenge the sole-born son — on his shoulder lay braided breast-mail barring death withstanding entrance of edge or blade life would have ended for ecgtheow ’ s son under wide earth for that earl of geats had his armor of war not aided him battle-net hard and holy god wielded the victory wisest maker the lord of heaven allowed his cause and easily rose the earl erect ‘ mid the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant old-sword of eotens with edge of proof warriors ’ heirloom weapon unmatched — save only ‘ twas more than other men to bandy-of-battle could bear at all — as the giants had wrought it ready and keen seized then its chain-hilt the scyldings ’ chieftain bold and battle-grim brandished the sword reckless of life and so wrathfully smote that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard her bone-rings breaking the blade pierced through that fated-one ’ s flesh to floor she sank bloody the blade he was blithe of his deed then blazed forth light ‘ twas bright within as when from the sky there shines unclouded heaven ’ s candle the hall he scanned by the wall then went he his weapon raised high by its hilts the hygelac-thane angry and eager that edge was not useless to the warrior now he wished with speed grendel to guerdon for grim raids many for the war he waged on western-danes oftener far than an only time when of hrothgar ’ s hearth-companions he slew in slumber in sleep devoured fifteen men of the folk of danes and as many others outward bore his horrible prey well paid for that the wrathful prince for now prone he saw grendel stretched there spent with war spoiled of life so scathed had left him heorot ’ s battle the body sprang far when after death it endured the blow sword-stroke savage that severed its head soon then saw the sage companions who waited with hrothgar watching the flood that the tossing waters turbid grew blood-stained the mere old men together hoary-haired of the hero spake the warrior would not they weened again proud of conquest come to seek their mighty master to many it seemed the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life the ninth hour came the noble scyldings left the headland homeward went the gold-friend of men but the guests sat on stared at the surges sick in heart and wished yet weened not their winsome lord again to see now that sword began from blood of the fight in battle-droppings war-blade to wane ‘ twas a wondrous thing that all of it melted as ice is wont when frosty fetters the father loosens unwinds the wave-bonds wielding all seasons and times the true god he nor took from that dwelling the duke of the geats precious things though a plenty he saw save only the head and that hilt withal blazoned with jewels the blade had melted burned was the bright sword her blood was so hot so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat downfall of demons up-dove through the flood the clashing waters were cleansed now waste of waves where the wandering fiend her life-days left and this lapsing world swam then to strand the sailors ’ -refuge sturdy-in-spirit of sea-booty glad of burden brave he bore with him went then to greet him and god they thanked the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe that safe and sound they could see him again soon from the hardy one helmet and armor deftly they doffed now drowsed the mere water ‘ neath welkin with war-blood stained forth they fared by the footpaths thence merry at heart the highways measured well-known roads courageous men carried the head from the cliff by the sea an arduous task for all the band the firm in fight since four were needed on the shaft-of-slaughter strenuously to bear to the gold-hall grendel ’ s head so presently to the palace there foemen fearless fourteen geats marching came their master-of-clan mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod strode then within the sovran thane fearless in fight of fame renowned hardy hero hrothgar to greet and next by the hair into hall was borne grendel ’ s head where the henchmen were drinking an awe to clan and queen alike a monster of marvel the men looked on beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ lo now this sea-booty son of healfdene lord of scyldings we ’ ve lustily brought thee sign of glory thou seest it here not lightly did i with my life escape in war under water this work i essayed with endless effort and even so my strength had been lost had the lord not shielded me not a whit could i with hrunting do in work of war though the weapon is good yet a sword the sovran of men vouchsafed me to spy on the wall there in splendor hanging old gigantic — how oft he guides the friendless wight — and i fought with that brand felling in fight since fate was with me the house ’ s wardens that war-sword then all burned bright blade when the blood gushed o ’ er it battle-sweat hot but the hilt i brought back from my foes so avenged i their fiendish deeds death-fall of danes as was due and right and this is my hest that in heorot now safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band and every thane of all thy folk both old and young no evil fear scyldings ’ lord from that side again aught ill for thy earls as erst thou must ” then the golden hilt for that gray-haired leader hoary hero in hand was laid giant-wrought old so owned and enjoyed it after downfall of devils the danish lord wonder-smiths ’ work since the world was rid of that grim-souled fiend the foe of god murder-marked and his mother as well now it passed into power of the people ’ s king best of all that the oceans bound who have scattered their gold o ’ er scandia ’ s isle hrothgar spake — the hilt he viewed heirloom old where was etched the rise of that far-off fight when the floods o ’ erwhelmed raging waves the race of giants fearful their fate a folk estranged from god eternal whence guerdon due in that waste of waters the wielder paid them so on the guard of shining gold in runic staves it was rightly said for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought best of blades in bygone days and the hilt well wound — the wise-one spake son of healfdene silent were all — “ lo so may he say who sooth and right follows ‘ mid folk of far times mindful a land-warden old that this earl belongs to the better breed so borne aloft thy fame must fly o friend my beowulf far and wide o ’ er folksteads many firmly thou shalt all maintain mighty strength

of ecgwela honor-scyldings nor grew for their grace but for grisly slaughter for doom of death to the danishmen he slew wrath-swollen his shoulder-comrades companions at board so he passed alone chieftain haughty from human cheer though him the maker with might endowed delights of power and uplifted high above all men yet blood-fierce his mind his breast-hoard grew no bracelets gave he to

” glad was the geats ’ lord going betimes to seek his seat as the sage commanded afresh as before for the famed-in-battle for the band of the hall was a banquet dight nobly anew the night-helm darkened dusk o ’ er the drinkers the doughty ones rose for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest aged scylding and eager the geat shield-fighter sturdy for sleeping yearned him wander-weary warrior-guest from far a hall-thane heralded forth who by custom courtly cared for all needs of a thane as in those old days warrior-wanderers wont to have so slumbered the stout-heart stately the hall rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven blithe-heart boded bright came flying shine after shadow the swordsmen hastened athelings all were eager homeward forth to fare and far from thence the great-hearted guest would guide his keel bade then the hardy-one hrunting be brought to the son of ecglaf the sword bade him take excellent iron and uttered his thanks for it quoth that he counted it keen in battle “ war-friend ” winsome with words he slandered not edge of the blade ‘ twas a big-hearted man now eager for parting and armed at point warriors waited while went to his host that darling of danes the doughty atheling to high-seat hastened and hrothgar greeted beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ lo we seafarers say our will far-come men that we fain would seek hygelac now we here have found hosts to our heart thou hast harbored us well if ever on earth i am able to win me more of thy love o lord of men aught anew than i now have

win thy triumph and lending thee might when thou lackest men if thy hrethric should come to court of geats a sovran ’ s son he will surely there find his friends a far-off land each man should visit who vaunts him brave. ” him then answering hrothgar spake — “ these words of thine the wisest god sent to thy soul no sager counsel from so young in years e ’ er yet have i heard thou art strong of

my landfolk towards friend and foe are firmly joined and honor they keep in the olden way. ” to him in the hall then healfdene ’ s son gave treasures twelve and the trust-of-earls bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved hale to his home and in haste return then kissed the king of kin renowned scyldings ’ chieftain that choicest thane and fell on his neck fast flowed the tears of the hoary-headed heavy with winters he had chances twain but he clung to this — that each should look on the other again and hear him in hall was this hero so dear to him his breast ’ s wild billows he

wave-roamer bode riding at anchor its owner awaiting as they hastened onward hrothgar ’ s gift they lauded at length — ‘ twas a lord unpeered every way blameless till age had broken it spareth no

no hostile words reached the guests as he rode to greet them but “ welcome ” he called to that weder clan as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on then on the strand with steeds and treasure and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship was heavily laden high its mast rose over hrothgar ’ s hoarded gems a sword to the boat-guard beowulf gave mounted with gold on the mead-bench since he was better esteemed that blade possessing heirloom old — their ocean-keel boarding they drove through the deep and daneland left a sea-cloth was set a sail with ropes firm to the mast the flood-timbers

waited and watched afar he bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship with anchor-bands lest ocean-billows that trusty timber should tear away then beowulf bade them bear the treasure gold and jewels

his sovran he sat come safe from battle kinsman by kinsman his kindly lord he first had greeted in gracious form with manly words the mead dispensing came through the high hall haereth ’ s daughter winsome to warriors wine-cup bore to the hands of the heroes hygelac then his comrade fairly with question plied in the lofty hall sore longing to know what manner of sojourn the sea-geats made “ what came of thy quest my kinsman beowulf when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder battle to seek o ’ er the briny sea combat in heorot hrothgar couldst thou aid at all the honored chief in his

their feud themselves with grendel now god be thanked that safe and sound i can see thee now ” beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow — “ ‘ tis known and unhidden hygelac lord to many men that meeting of ours struggle grim between grendel and me which we fought on the field where full too many sorrows he wrought for the scylding-victors evils unending these all i avenged no boast can be from breed of grendel any on earth for that uproar at dawn from the longest-lived of the loathsome race in fleshly fold — but first i went hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts where healfdene ’ s kinsman high-renowned soon as my purpose was plain to him assigned me a seat by his son and heir the liegemen were lusty my life-days never such merry men over mead in hall have i heard under heaven the high-born queen people ’ s peace-bringer passed through the hall cheered the young clansmen clasps of gold ere she sought her seat to sundry gave oft to the heroes hrothgar ’ s daughter to earls in

to the scylding ’ s-friend kingdom ’ s-keeper he counts it wise the woman to wed so and ward off feud store of slaughter but seldom ever when men are slain does the murder-spear sink but briefest while though the bride be fair “ nor haply will like it the heathobard lord and as little each of his liegemen all when a thane of the danes in that doughty throng goes with the lady along their hall and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten hard and ring-decked heathobard ’ s treasure weapons that once they wielded fair until they lost at the linden-play liegeman leal and their lives as well then over the ale on this heirloom gazing some ash-wielder old who has all in mind that spear-death of men — he is stern of mood heavy at heart — in the hero young tests the temper and tries the soul and war-hate wakens with words like these — canst thou not comrade ken that sword which to the fray thy father carried in his final feud ‘ neath the fighting-mask dearest of blades when the danish slew him and wielded the war-place on withergild ’ s fall after havoc of heroes those hardy scyldings now the son of a certain slaughtering dane proud of his treasure paces this hall joys in the killing and carries the jewel that rightfully ought to be owned by thee thus he urges and eggs him all the time with keenest words till occasion offers that freawaru ’ s thane for his father ’ s deed after

kinsman and all of the brave man ’ s body devoured yet none the earlier empty-handed would the bloody-toothed murderer mindful of bale outward go from the gold-decked hall but me he attacked in his terror of might with greedy hand grasped me a glove hung by him wide and wondrous wound with bands and in artful wise it all was wrought by devilish craft of dragon-skins me therein an innocent man the fiendish foe was fain to thrust with many another he might not so when i all angrily upright stood ‘ twere long to relate how that land-destroyer i paid in kind for his cruel deeds yet there my prince this people of thine got fame by my fighting he fled away and a little space his life preserved but there staid behind him his stronger hand left in heorot heartsick thence on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell me for this struggle the scyldings ’ -friend paid in plenty with plates of gold with many a treasure when morn had come and we all at the banquet-board sat down then was song and glee the gray-haired scylding much tested told of the times of yore whiles the hero his harp bestirred wood-of-delight now lays he chanted of sooth and sadness or said aright legends of wonder the wide-hearted king or for years of his youth he would yearn at times for strength of old struggles now stricken with age hoary hero his heart surged full when wise with winters he wailed their flight

then in the waters — ‘ tis widely known — that sea-floor-guardian savage found hand-to-hand there a while we struggled billows welled blood in the briny hall her head i hewed with a hardy blade from grendel ’ s mother — and gained my life though not without danger my doom was not yet then the haven-of-heroes healfdene ’ s son gave me in guerdon great gifts of price “ so held this king to the customs old that i wanted for nought in the wage i gained the meed of my might he made me gifts healfdene ’ s heir for my own disposal now to thee my prince i proffer them all gladly give them thy grace alone can find me favor few indeed have i of kinsmen save hygelac thee ” then he bade them bear him the boar-head standard the battle-helm high and breastplate gray the splendid sword then spake in form — “ me this war-gear the wise old prince hrothgar gave and his hest he added that its story be straightway said to thee — a while it was held by heorogar king for long time lord of the land of scyldings yet not to his son the sovran left it to daring heoroweard — dear as he was to him his harness of battle — well hold thou it all ” and i heard that soon passed o ’ er the path of this treasure all apple-fallow four good steeds each like the others arms and horses he gave to the king so should kinsmen be not weave one another the net of wiles or with deep-hid treachery death contrive for neighbor and comrade his nephew was ever by hardy hygelac held full dear and each kept watch o ’ er the other ’ s weal i heard too the necklace to hygd he presented wonder-wrought treasure which wealhtheow gave him sovran ’ s daughter three steeds he added slender and saddle-gay since such gift the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen thus showed his strain the son of ecgtheow as a man remarked for mighty deeds and acts of honor at ale he slew not comrade or kin nor cruel his mood though of sons of earth his strength was greatest a glorious gift that god had sent the splendid leader long was he spurned and worthless by geatish warriors held him at mead the master-of-clans failed full oft to favor at all slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him profitless prince but payment came to the warrior honored for all his woes — then the bulwark-of-earls bade bring within hardy chieftain hrethel ’ s heirloom garnished with gold no geat e ’ er knew in shape of a sword a statelier prize the brand he laid in beowulf ’ s lap and of hides assigned him seven thousand with house and high-seat they held in common land alike by their line of birth inheritance home but higher the king because of his rule o ’ er the realm itself now further it fell with the flight of years with harryings horrid that hygelac perished and heardred too by hewing of swords under the shield-wall slaughtered lay when him at the van of his victor-folk sought hardy heroes heatho-scilfings in arms o ’ erwhelming hereric ’ s nephew then beowulf came as king this broad realm to wield and he ruled it well fifty winters a wise old prince warding his land until one began in the dark of night a dragon to rage in the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded in the stone-barrow steep a strait path reached it unknown to mortals some man however came by chance that cave within to the heathen hoard in hand he took a golden goblet nor gave he it back stole with it away while the watcher slept by thievish wiles for the warden ’ s wrath prince and people must pay betimes that way he went with no will of his own in danger of life to the dragon ’ s hoard but for pressure of peril some prince ’ s thane he fled in fear the fatal scourge seeking shelter a sinful man and entered in at the awful sight tottered that guest and terror seized him yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon from fright and fear ere he fled away and took the cup from that treasure-hoard of such besides there was store enough heirlooms old the earth below which some earl forgotten in ancient years left the last of his lofty race heedfully there had hidden away dearest treasure for death of yore had hurried all hence and he alone left to live the last of the clan weeping his friends yet wished to bide warding the treasure his one delight though brief his respite the barrow new-ready to strand and sea-waves stood anear hard by the headland hidden and closed there laid within it his lordly heirlooms and heaped hoard of heavy gold that warden of rings few words he spake “ now hold thou earth since heroes may not what earls have owned lo erst from thee brave men brought it but battle-death seized and cruel killing my clansmen all robbed them of life and a liegeman ’ s joys none have i left to lift the sword or to cleanse the carven cup of price beaker bright my brave are gone and the helmet hard all haughty with gold shall part from its plating polishers sleep who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask and those weeds of war that were wont to brave over bicker of shields the bite of steel rust with their bearer the ringed mail fares not far with famous chieftain at side of hero no harp ’ s delight no glee-wood ’ s gladness no good hawk now flies through the hall nor horses fleet stamp in the burgstead battle and death the flower of my race have reft away. ” mournful of mood thus he moaned his woe alone for them all and unblithe wept by day and by night till death ’ s fell wave o ’ erwhelmed his heart his hoard-of-bliss that old ill-doer open found who blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth naked foe-dragon flying by night folded in fire the folk of earth dread him sore ‘ tis his doom to seek hoard in the graves and heathen gold to watch many-wintered nor wins he thereby powerful this plague-of-the-people thus held the house of the hoard in earth three hundred winters till one aroused wrath in his breast to the ruler bearing that costly cup and the king implored for bond of peace so the barrow was plundered borne off was booty his boon was granted that wretched man and his ruler saw first time what was fashioned in far-off days when the dragon awoke new woe was kindled o ’ er the stone he snuffed the stark-heart found footprint of foe who so far had gone in his hidden craft by the creature ’ s head — so may the undoomed easily flee evils and exile if only he gain the grace of the wielder — that warden of gold o ’ er the ground went seeking greedy to find the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep savage and burning the barrow he circled all without nor was any there none in the waste ... yet war he desired was eager for battle the barrow he entered sought the cup and discovered soon that some one of mortals had searched his treasure his lordly gold the guardian waited ill-enduring till evening came boiling with wrath was the barrow ’ s keeper and fain with flame the foe to pay for the dear cup ’ s loss — now day was fled as the worm had wished by its wall no more was it glad to bide but burning flew folded in flame a fearful beginning for sons of the soil and soon it came in the doom of their lord to a dreadful end then the baleful fiend its fire belched out and bright homes burned the blaze stood high all landsfolk frighting no living thing would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew wide was the dragon ’ s warring seen its fiendish fury far and near as the grim destroyer those geatish people hated and hounded to hidden lair to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn folk of the land it had lapped in flame with bale and brand in its barrow it trusted its battling and bulwarks that boast was vain to beowulf then the bale was told quickly and truly the king ’ s own home of buildings the best in brand-waves melted that gift-throne of geats to the good old man sad in heart ‘ twas heaviest sorrow the sage assumed that his sovran god he had angered breaking ancient law and embittered the lord his breast within with black thoughts welled as his wont was never the folk ’ s own fastness that fiery dragon with flame had destroyed and the stronghold all washed by waves but the warlike king prince of the weders plotted vengeance warriors ’ -bulwark he bade them work all of iron — the earl ’ s commander — a war-shield wondrous well he knew that forest-wood against fire were worthless linden could aid not — atheling brave he was fated to finish this fleeting life his days on earth and the dragon with him though long it had watched o ’ er the wealth of the hoard — shame he reckoned it sharer-of-rings to follow the flyer-afar with a host a broad-flung band nor the battle feared he nor deemed he dreadful the dragon ’ s warring its vigor and valor ventures desperate he had passed a-plenty and perils of war contest-crash since conqueror proud hrothgar ’ s hall he had wholly purged and in grapple had killed the kin of grendel loathsome breed not least was that of hand-to-hand fights where hygelac fell when the ruler of geats in rush of battle lord of his folk in the frisian land son of hrethel by sword-draughts died by brands down-beaten thence beowulf fled through strength of himself and his swimming power though alone and his arms were laden with thirty coats of mail when he came to the sea nor yet might hetwaras haughtily boast their craft of contest who carried against him shields to the fight but few escaped from strife with the hero to seek their homes then swam over ocean ecgtheow ’ s son lonely and sorrowful seeking his land where hygd made him offer of hoard and realm rings and royal-seat reckoning naught the strength of her son to save their kingdom from hostile hordes after hygelac ’ s death no sooner for this could the stricken ones in any wise move that atheling ’ s mind over young heardred ’ s head as lord and ruler of all the realm to be yet the hero upheld him with helpful words aided in honor till older grown he wielded the weder-geats — wandering exiles sought him o ’ er seas the sons of ohtere who had spurned the sway of the scylfings ’ -helmet the bravest and best that broke the rings in swedish land of the sea-kings ’ line haughty hero hence heardred ’ s end for shelter he gave them sword-death came the blade ’ s fell blow to bairn of hygelac but the son of ongentheow sought again house and home when heardred fell leaving beowulf lord of geats and gift-seat ’ s master — a good king he the fall of his lord he was fain to requite in after days and to eadgils he proved friend to the friendless and forces sent over the sea to the son of ohtere weapons and warriors well repaid he those care-paths cold when the king he slew thus safe through struggles the son of ecgtheow had passed a plenty through perils dire with daring deeds till this day was come that doomed him now with the dragon to strive with comrades eleven the lord of geats swollen in rage went seeking the dragon he had heard whence all the harm arose and the killing of clansmen that cup of price on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder in the throng was this one thirteenth man starter of all the strife and ill care-laden captive cringing thence forced and reluctant he led them on till he came in ken of that cavern-hall the barrow delved near billowy surges flood of ocean within ‘ twas full of wire-gold and jewels a jealous warden warrior trusty the treasures held lurked in his lair not light the task of entrance for any of earth-born men sat on the headland the hero king spake words of hail to his hearth-companions gold-friend of geats all gloomy his soul wavering death-bound wyrd full nigh stood ready to greet the gray-haired man to seize his soul-hoard sunder apart life and body not long would be the warrior ’ s spirit enwound with flesh beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow — “ through store of struggles i strove in youth mighty feuds i mind them all i was seven years old when the sovran of rings friend-of-his-folk from my father took me had me and held me hrethel the king with food and fee faithful in kinship ne ’ er while i lived there he loathlier found me bairn in the burg than his birthright sons herebeald and haethcyn and hygelac mine for the eldest of these by unmeet chance by kinsman ’ s deed was the death-bed strewn when haethcyn killed him with horny bow his own dear liege laid low with an arrow missed the mark and his mate shot down one brother the other with bloody shaft a feeless fight and a fearful sin horror to hrethel yet hard as it was unavenged must the atheling die too awful it is for an aged man to bide and bear that his bairn so young rides on the gallows a rime he makes sorrow-song for his son there hanging as rapture of ravens no rescue now can come from the old disabled man still is he minded as morning breaks of the heir gone elsewhere another he hopes not he will bide to see his burg within as ward for his wealth now the one has found doom of death that the deed incurred forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers reft of revel the rider sleepeth the hero far-hidden no harp resounds in the courts no wassail as once was heard “ then he goes to his chamber a grief-song chants alone for his lost too large all seems homestead and house so the helmet-of-weders hid in his heart for herebeald waves of woe no way could he take to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul nor e ’ en could he harass that hero at all with loathing deed though he loved him not and so for the sorrow his soul endured men ’ s gladness he gave up and god ’ s light chose lands and cities he left his sons as the wealthy do when he went from earth there was strife and struggle ‘ twixt swede and geat o ’ er the width of waters war arose hard battle-horror when hrethel died and ongentheow ’ s offspring grew strife-keen bold nor brooked o ’ er the seas pact of peace but pushed their hosts to harass in hatred by hreosnabeorh men of my folk for that feud had vengeance for woful war ‘ tis widely known though one of them bought it with blood of his heart a bargain hard for haethcyn proved fatal that fray for the first-of-geats at morn i heard was the murderer killed by kinsman for kinsman with clash of sword when ongentheow met eofor there wide split the war-helm wan he fell hoary scylfing the hand that smote him of feud was mindful nor flinched from the death-blow — “ for all that he gave me my gleaming sword repaid him at war — such power i wielded — for lordly treasure with land he entrusted me homestead and house he had no need from swedish realm or from spear-dane folk or from men of the gifths to get him help — some warrior worse for wage to buy ever i fought in the front of all sole to the fore and so shall i fight while i bide in life and this blade shall last that early and late hath loyal proved since for my doughtiness daeghrefn fell slain by my hand the hugas ’ champion nor fared he thence to the frisian king with the booty back and breast-adornments but slain in struggle that standard-bearer fell atheling brave not with blade was he slain but his bones were broken by brawny gripe his heart-waves stilled — the sword-edge now hard blade and my hand for the hoard shall strive. ” beowulf spake and a battle-vow made his last of all “ i have lived through many wars in my youth now once again old folk-defender feud will i seek do doughty deeds if the dark destroyer forth from his cavern come to fight me ” then hailed he the helmeted heroes all for the last time greeting his liegemen dear comrades of war “ i should carry no weapon no sword to the serpent if sure i knew how with such enemy else my vows i could gain as i did in grendel ’ s day but fire in this fight i must fear me now and poisonous breath so i bring with me breastplate and board from the barrow ’ s keeper no footbreadth flee i. one fight shall end our war by the wall as wyrd allots all mankind ’ s master my mood is bold but forbears to boast o ’ er this battling-flyer — now abide by the barrow ye breastplate-mailed ye heroes in harness which of us twain better from battle-rush bear his wounds wait ye the finish the fight is not yours nor meet for any but me alone to measure might with this monster here and play the hero hardily i shall win that wealth or war shall seize cruel killing your king and lord ” up stood then with shield the sturdy champion stayed by the strength of his single manhood and hardy ‘ neath helmet his harness bore under cleft of the cliffs no coward ’ s path soon spied by the wall that warrior chief survivor of many a victory-field where foemen fought with furious clashings an arch of stone and within a stream that broke from the barrow the brooklet ’ s wave was hot with fire the hoard that way he never could hope unharmed to near or endure those deeps for the dragon ’ s flame then let from his breast for he burst with rage the weder-geat prince a word outgo stormed the stark-heart stern went ringing and clear his cry ‘ neath the cliff-rocks gray the hoard-guard heard a human voice his rage was enkindled no respite now for pact of peace the poison-breath of that foul worm first came forth from the cave hot reek-of-fight the rocks resounded stout by the stone-way his shield he raised lord of the geats against the loathed-one while with courage keen that coiled foe came seeking strife the sturdy king had drawn his sword not dull of edge heirloom old and each of the two felt fear of his foe though fierce their mood stoutly stood with his shield high-raised the warrior king as the worm now coiled together amain the mailed-one waited now spire by spire fast sped and glided that blazing serpent the shield protected soul and body a shorter while for the hero-king than his heart desired could his will have wielded the welcome respite but once in his life but wyrd denied it and victory ’ s honors — his arm he lifted lord of the geats the grim foe smote with atheling ’ s heirloom its edge was turned brown blade on the bone and bit more feebly than its noble master had need of then in his baleful stress — then the barrow ’ s keeper waxed full wild for that weighty blow cast deadly flames wide drove and far those vicious fires no victor ’ s glory the geats ’ lord boasted his brand had failed naked in battle as never it should excellent iron — ‘ twas no easy path that ecgtheow ’ s honored heir must tread over the plain to the place of the foe for against his will he must win a home elsewhere far as must all men leaving this lapsing life — not long it was ere those champions grimly closed again the hoard-guard was heartened high heaved his breast once more and by peril was pressed again enfolded in flames the folk-commander nor yet about him his band of comrades sons of athelings armed stood with warlike front to the woods they bent them their lives to save but the soul of one with care was cumbered kinship true can never be marred in a noble mind wiglaf his name was weohstan ’ s son linden-thane loved the lord of scylfings aelfhere ’ s kinsman his king he now saw with heat under helmet hard oppressed he minded the prizes his prince had given him wealthy seat of the waegmunding line and folk-rights that his father owned not long he lingered the linden yellow his shield he seized the old sword he drew — as heirloom of eanmund earth-dwellers knew it who was slain by the sword-edge son of ohtere friendless exile erst in fray killed by weohstan who won for his kin brown-bright helmet breastplate ringed old sword of eotens onela ’ s gift weeds of war of the warrior-thane battle-gear brave though a brother ’ s child had been felled the feud was unfelt by onela for winters this war-gear weohstan kept breastplate and board till his bairn had grown earlship to earn as the old sire did then he gave him mid geats the gear of battle portion huge when he passed from life fared aged forth for the first time now with his leader-lord the liegeman young was bidden to share the shock of battle neither softened his soul nor the sire ’ s bequest weakened in war so the worm found out when once in fight the foes had met wiglaf spake — and his words were sage sad in spirit he said to his comrades — “ i remember the time when mead we took what promise we made to this prince of ours in the banquet-hall to our breaker-of-rings for gear of combat to give him requital for hard-sword and helmet if hap should bring stress of this sort himself who chose us from all his army to aid him now urged us to glory and gave these treasures because he counted us keen with the spear and hardy ‘ neath helm though this hero-work our leader hoped unhelped and alone to finish for us — folk-defender who hath got him glory greater than all men for daring deeds now the day is come that our noble master has need of the might of warriors stout let us stride along the hero to help while the heat is about him glowing and grim for god is my witness i am far more fain the fire should seize along with my lord these limbs of mine unsuiting it seems our shields to bear homeward hence save here we essay to fell the foe and defend the life of the weders ’ lord i wot ‘ twere shame on the law of our land if alone the king out of geatish warriors woe endured and sank in the struggle my sword and helmet breastplate and board for us both shall serve ” through slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain his battle-helm bore and brief words spake — “ beowulf dearest do all bravely as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise thy glory droop now great in deeds atheling steadfast with all thy strength shield thy life i will stand to help thee. ” at the words the worm came once again murderous monster mad with rage with fire-billows flaming its foes to seek the hated men in heat-waves burned that board to the boss and the breastplate failed to shelter at all the spear-thane young yet quickly under his kinsman ’ s shield went eager the earl since his own was now all burned by the blaze the bold king again had mind of his glory with might his glaive was driven into the dragon ’ s head — blow nerved by hate but naegling was shivered broken in battle was beowulf ’ s sword old and gray ‘ twas granted him not that ever the edge of iron at all could help him at strife too strong was his hand so the tale is told and he tried too far with strength of stroke all swords he wielded though sturdy their steel they steaded him nought then for the third time thought on its feud that folk-destroyer fire-dread dragon and rushed on the hero where room allowed battle-grim burning its bitter teeth closed on his neck and covered him with waves of blood from his breast that welled ‘ twas now men say in his sovran ’ s need that the earl made known his noble strain craft and keenness and courage enduring heedless of harm though his hand was burned hardy-hearted he helped his kinsman a little lower the loathsome beast he smote with sword his steel drove in bright and burnished that blaze began to lose and lessen at last the king wielded his wits again war-knife drew a biting blade by his breastplate hanging and the weders ’ -helm smote that worm asunder felled the foe flung forth its life so had they killed it kinsmen both athelings twain thus an earl should be in danger ’ s day — of deeds of valor this conqueror ’ s-hour of the king was last of his work in the world the wound began which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted to swell and smart and soon he found in his breast was boiling baleful and deep pain of poison the prince walked on wise in his thought to the wall of rock then sat and stared at the structure of giants where arch of stone and steadfast column upheld forever that hall in earth yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless lave with water his winsome lord the king and conqueror covered with blood with struggle spent and unspan his helmet beowulf spake in spite of his hurt his mortal wound full well he knew his portion now was past and gone of earthly bliss and all had fled of his file of days and death was near “ i would fain bestow on son of mine this gear of war were given me now that any heir should after me come of my proper blood this people i ruled fifty winters no folk-king was there none at all of the neighboring clans who war would wage me with ‘ warriors ’ -friends ’ and threat me with horrors at home i bided what fate might come and i cared for mine own feuds i sought not nor falsely swore ever on oath for all these things though fatally wounded fain am i from the ruler-of-man no wrath shall seize me when life from my frame must flee away for killing of kinsmen now quickly go and gaze on that hoard ‘ neath the hoary rock wiglaf loved now the worm lies low sleeps heart-sore of his spoil bereaved and fare in haste i would fain behold the gorgeous heirlooms golden store have joy in the jewels and gems lay down softlier for sight of this splendid hoard my life and the lordship i long have held. ” i have heard that swiftly the son of weohstan at wish and word of his wounded king — war-sick warrior — woven mail-coat battle-sark bore ‘ neath the barrow ’ s roof then the clansman keen of conquest proud passing the seat saw store of jewels and glistening gold the ground along by the wall were marvels and many a vessel in the den of the dragon the dawn-flier old unburnished bowls of bygone men reft of richness rusty helms of the olden age and arm-rings many wondrously woven — such wealth of gold booty from barrow can burden with pride each human wight let him hide it who will — his glance too fell on a gold-wove banner high o ’ er the hoard of handiwork noblest brilliantly broidered so bright its gleam all the earth-floor he easily saw and viewed all these vessels no vestige now was seen of the serpent the sword had ta ’ en him then i heard the hill of its hoard was reft old work of giants by one alone he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate at his own good will and the ensign took brightest of beacons — the blade of his lord — its edge was iron — had injured deep one that guarded the golden hoard many a year and its murder-fire spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows at midnight hour till it met its doom hasted the herald the hoard so spurred him his track to retrace he was troubled by doubt high-souled hero if haply he ’ d find alive where he left him the lord of weders weakening fast by the wall of the cave so he carried the load his lord and king he found all bleeding famous chief at the lapse of life the liegeman again plashed him with water till point of word broke through the breast-hoard beowulf spake sage and sad as he stared at the gold — “ for the gold and treasure to god my thanks to the wielder-of-wonders with words i say for what i behold to heaven ’ s lord for the grace that i give such gifts to my folk or ever the day of my death be run now i ’ ve bartered here for booty of treasure the last of my life so look ye well to the needs of my land no longer i tarry a barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise for my ashes ‘ twill shine by the shore of the flood to folk of mine memorial fair on hrones headland high uplifted that ocean-wanderers oft may hail beowulf ’ s barrow as back from far they drive their keels o ’ er the darkling wave. ” from his neck he unclasped the collar of gold valorous king to his vassal gave it with bright-gold helmet breastplate and ring to the youthful thane bade him use them in joy “ thou art end and remnant of all our race the waegmunding name for wyrd hath swept them all my line to the land of doom earls in their glory i after them go. ” this word was the last which the wise old man harbored in heart ere hot death-waves of balefire he chose from his bosom fled his soul to seek the saints ’ reward it was heavy hap for that hero young on his lord beloved to look and find him lying on earth with life at end sorrowful sight but the slayer too awful earth-dragon empty of breath lay felled in fight nor fain of its treasure could the writhing monster rule it more for edges of iron had ended its days hard and battle-sharp hammers ’ leaving and that flier-afar had fallen to ground hushed by its hurt its hoard all near no longer lusty aloft to whirl at midnight making its merriment seen proud of its prizes prone it sank by the handiwork of the hero-king forsooth among folk but few achieve — though sturdy and strong as stories tell me and never so daring in deed of valor — the perilous breath of a poison-foe to brave and to rush on the ring-board hall whenever his watch the warden keeps bold in the barrow beowulf paid the price of death for that precious hoard and each of the foes had found the end of this fleeting life befell erelong that the laggards in war the wood had left trothbreakers cowards ten together fearing before to flourish a spear in the sore distress of their sovran lord now in their shame their shields they carried armor of fight where the old man lay and they gazed on wiglaf wearied he sat at his sovran ’ s shoulder shieldsman good to wake him with water nowise it availed though well he wished it in world no more could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles nor baffle the will of all-wielding god doom of the lord was law o ’ er the deeds of every man as it is to-day grim was the answer easy to get from the youth for those that had yielded to fear wiglaf spake the son of weohstan — mournful he looked on those men unloved — “ who sooth will speak can say indeed that the ruler who gave you golden rings and the harness of war in which ye stand — for he at ale-bench often-times bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate lord to liegemen the likeliest gear which near of far he could find to give — threw away and wasted these weeds of battle on men who failed when the foemen came not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms venture to vaunt though the victory-wielder god gave him grace that he got revenge sole with his sword in stress and need to rescue his life ‘ twas little that i could serve him in struggle yet shift i made hopeless it seemed to help my kinsman its strength ever waned when with weapon i struck that fatal foe and the fire less strongly flowed from its head — too few the heroes in throe of contest that thronged to our king now gift of treasure and girding of sword joy of the house and home-delight shall fail your folk his freehold-land every clansman within your kin shall lose and leave when lords highborn hear afar of that flight of yours a fameless deed yea death is better for liegemen all than a life of shame ” that battle-toil bade he at burg to announce at the fort on the cliff where full of sorrow all the morning earls had sat daring shieldsmen in doubt of twain would they wail as dead or welcome home their lord beloved little kept back of the tidings new but told them all the herald that up the headland rode — “ now the willing-giver to weder folk in death-bed lies the lord of geats on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent ’ s deed and beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men with knife-wounds sick no sword availed on the awesome thing in any wise to work a wound there wiglaf sitteth weohstan ’ s bairn by beowulf ’ s side the living earl by the other dead and heavy of heart a head-watch keeps o ’ er friend and foe — now our folk may look for waging of war when once unhidden to frisian and frank the fall of the king is spread afar — the strife began when hot on the hugas hygelac fell and fared with his fleet to the frisian land him there the hetwaras humbled in war plied with such prowess their power o ’ erwhelming that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it and fell in fight to his friends no wise could that earl give treasure and ever since the merowings ’ favor has failed us wholly nor aught expect i of peace and faith from swedish folk ‘ twas spread afar how ongentheow reft at ravenswood haethcyn hrethling of hope and life when the folk of geats for the first time sought in wanton pride the warlike-scylfings soon the sage old sire of ohtere ancient and awful gave answering blow the sea-king he slew and his spouse redeemed his good wife rescued though robbed of her gold mother of ohtere and onela then he followed his foes who fled before him sore beset and stole their way bereft of a ruler to ravenswood with his host he besieged there what swords had left the weary and wounded woes he threatened the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng some with the morrow his sword should kill some should go to the gallows-tree for rapture of ravens but rescue came with dawn of day for those desperate men when they heard the horn of hygelac sound tones of his trumpet the trusty king had followed their trail with faithful band the bloody swath of swedes and geats and the storm of their strife were seen afar how folk against folk the fight had wakened the ancient king with his atheling band sought his citadel sorrowing much ongentheow earl went up to his burg he had tested hygelac ’ s hardihood the proud one ’ s prowess would prove it no longer defied no more those fighting-wanderers nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard his bairn and his bride so he bent him again old to his earth-walls yet after him came with slaughter for swedes the standards of hygelac o ’ er peaceful plains in pride advancing till hrethelings fought in the fenced town then ongentheow with edge of sword the hoary-bearded was held at bay and the folk-king there was forced to suffer eofor ’ s anger in ire at the king wulf wonreding with weapon struck and the chieftain ’ s blood for that blow in streams flowed ‘ neath his hair no fear felt he stout old scylfing but straightway repaid in better bargain that bitter stroke and faced his foe with fell intent nor swift enough was the son of wonred answer to render the aged chief too soon on his head the helm was cloven blood-bedecked he bowed to earth and fell adown not doomed was he yet and well he waxed though the wound was sore then the hardy hygelac-thane when his brother fell with broad brand smote giants ’ sword crashing through giants ’ -helm across the shield-wall sank the king his folk ’ s old herdsman fatally hurt there were many to bind the brother ’ s wounds and lift him fast as fate allowed his people to wield the place-of-war but eofor took from ongentheow earl from other the iron-breastplate hard sword hilted and helmet too and the hoar-chief ’ s harness to hygelac carried who took the trappings and truly promised rich fee ‘ mid folk — and fulfilled it so for that grim strife gave the geatish lord hrethel ’ s offspring when home he came to eofor and wulf a wealth of treasure each of them had a hundred thousand in land and linked rings nor at less price reckoned mid-earth men such mighty deeds and to eofor he gave his only daughter in pledge of grace the pride of his home “ such is the feud the foeman ’ s rage death-hate of men so i deem it sure that the swedish folk will seek us home for this fall of their friends the fighting-scylfings when once they learn that our warrior leader lifeless lies who land and hoard ever defended from all his foes furthered his folk ’ s weal finished his course a hardy hero — now haste is best that we go to gaze on our geatish lord and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings to the funeral pyre no fragments merely shall burn with the warrior wealth of jewels gold untold and gained in terror treasure at last with his life obtained all of that booty the brands shall take fire shall eat it no earl must carry memorial jewel no maiden fair shall wreathe her neck with noble ring nay sad in spirit and shorn of her gold oft shall she pass o ’ er paths of exile now our lord all laughter has laid aside all mirth and revel many a spear morning-cold shall be clasped amain lifted aloft nor shall lilt of harp those warriors wake but the wan-hued raven fain o ’ er the fallen his feast shall praise and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate when he and the wolf were wasting the slain. ” so he told his sorrowful tidings and little he lied the loyal man of word or of work the warriors rose sad they climbed to the cliff-of-eagles went welling with tears the wonder to view found on the sand there stretched at rest their lifeless lord who had lavished rings of old upon them ending-day had dawned on the doughty-one death had seized in woful slaughter the weders ’ king there saw they besides the strangest being loathsome lying their leader near prone on the field the fiery dragon fearful fiend with flame was scorched reckoned by feet it was fifty measures in length as it lay aloft erewhile it had revelled by night and anon come back seeking its den now in death ’ s sure clutch it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys by it there stood the stoups and jars dishes lay there and dear-decked swords eaten with rust as on earth ’ s lap resting a thousand winters they waited there for all that heritage huge that gold of bygone men was bound by a spell so the treasure-hall could be touched by none of human kind — save that heaven ’ s king god himself might give whom he would helper of heroes the hoard to open — even such a man as seemed to him meet a perilous path it proved he trod who heinously hid that hall within wealth under wall its watcher had killed one of a few and the feud was avenged in woful fashion wondrous seems it what manner a man of might and valor oft ends his life when the earl no longer in mead-hall may live with loving friends so beowulf when that barrow ’ s warden he sought and the struggle himself knew not in what wise he should wend from the world at last for princes potent who placed the gold with a curse to doomsday covered it deep so that marked with sin the man should be hedged with horrors in hell-bonds fast racked with plagues who should rob their hoard yet no greed for gold but the grace of heaven ever the king had kept in view wiglaf spake the son of weohstan — “ at the mandate of one oft warriors many sorrow must suffer and so must we the people ’ s-shepherd showed not aught of care for our counsel king beloved that guardian of gold he should grapple not urged we but let him lie where he long had been in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world the hest of heaven — this hoard is ours but grievously gotten too grim the fate which thither carried our king and lord i was within there and all i viewed the chambered treasure when chance allowed me and my path was made in no pleasant wise under the earth-wall eager i seized such heap from the hoard as hands could bear and hurriedly carried it hither back to my liege and lord alive was he still still wielding his wits the wise old man spake much in his sorrow and sent you greetings and bade that ye build when he breathed no more on the place of his balefire a barrow high memorial mighty of men was he worthiest warrior wide earth o ’ er the while he had joy of his jewels and burg let us set out in haste now the second time to see and search this store of treasure these wall-hid wonders — the way i show you — where gathered near ye may gaze your fill at broad-gold and rings let the bier soon made be all in order when out we come our king and captain to carry thither — man beloved — where long he shall bide safe in the shelter of sovran god. ” then the bairn of weohstan bade command hardy chief to heroes many that owned their homesteads hither to bring firewood from far — o ’ er the folk they ruled — for the famed-one ’ s funeral “ fire shall devour and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior who oft stood stout in the iron-shower when sped from the string a storm of arrows shot o ’ er the shield-wall the shaft held firm featly feathered followed the barb. ” and now the sage young son of weohstan seven chose of the chieftain ’ s thanes the best he found that band within and went with these warriors one of eight under hostile roof in hand one bore a lighted torch and led the way no lots they cast for keeping the hoard when once the warriors saw it in hall altogether without a guardian lying there lost and little they mourned when they had hastily haled it out dear-bought treasure the dragon they cast the worm o ’ er the wall for the wave to take and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems then the woven gold on a wain was laden — countless quite — and the king was borne hoary hero to hrones-ness then fashioned for him the folk of geats firm on the earth a funeral-pile and hung it with helmets and harness of war and breastplates bright as the boon he asked and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain heroes mourning their master dear then on the hill that hugest of balefires the warriors wakened wood-smoke rose black over blaze and blent was the roar of flame with weeping the wind was still till the fire had broken the frame of bones hot at the heart in heavy mood their misery moaned they their master ’ s death wailing her woe the widow old her hair upbound for beowulf ’ s death sung in her sorrow and said full oft she dreaded the doleful days to come deaths enow and doom of battle and shame — the smoke by the sky was devoured the folk of the weders fashioned there on the headland a barrow broad and high by ocean-farers far descried in ten days ’ time their toil had raised it the battle-brave ’ s beacon round brands of the pyre a wall they built the worthiest ever that wit could prompt in their wisest men they placed in the barrow that precious booty the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile hardy heroes from hoard in cave — trusting the ground with treasure of earls gold in the earth where ever it lies useless to men as of yore it was then about that barrow the battle-keen rode atheling-born a band of twelve lament to make to mourn their king chant their dirge and their chieftain honor they praised his earlship his acts of prowess worthily witnessed and well it is that men their master-friend mightily laud heartily love when hence he goes from life in the body forlorn away thus made their mourning the men of geatland for their hero ’ s passing his hearth-companions quoth that of all the kings of earth of men he was mildest and most beloved to his kin the kindest keenest for praise
in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenanted once a fair and stately palace— radiant palace—reared its head in the monarch thought ’ s dominion it stood there never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair banners yellow glorious golden on its roof did float and flow this—all this—was in the olden time long ago and every gentle air that dallied in that sweet day along the ramparts plumed and pallid a wingèd odor went away wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lute ’ s well-tunèd law round about a throne where sitting porphyrogene in state his glory well befitting the ruler of the realm was seen and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door through which came flowing flowing flowing and sparkling evermore a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing in voices of surpassing beauty the wit and wisdom of their king but evil things in robes of sorrow assailed the monarch ’ s high estate ah let us mourn —for never morrow shall dawn upon him desolate and round about his home the glory that blushed and bloomed is but a dim-remembered story of the old time entombed and travellers now within that valley through the red-litten windows see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody while like a ghastly rapid river through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laugh—but smile no more
when we first heard from blocks away the fog truck ’ s blustery roar we dropped our toys leapt from our meals and scrambled out the door into an evening briefly fuzzy we yearned to be transformed— translated past confining flesh to disembodied spirit we swarmed in thick smoke taking human form before we blurred again turned vague and then invisible in temporary heaven freed of bodies by the fog we laughed we sang we shouted we were our voices nothing else voice was all we wanted the white clouds tumbled down our streets pursued by spellbound children who chased the most distorting clouds ecstatic in the poison

it was an adventure much could be made of a walk on the shores of the darkest known river among the hooded shoving crowds by steaming rocks and rows of ruined huts half buried in the muck then to the great court with its marble yard whose emptiness gave him the creeps and to sit there in the sunken silence of the place and speak of what he had lost what he still possessed of his loss and then pulling out all the stops describing her eyes her forehead where the golden light of evening spread the curve of her neck the slope of her shoulders everything down to her thighs and calves letting the words come as if lifted from sleep to drift upstream against the water 's will where all the condemned and pointless labor stunned by his voice 's cadence would come to a halt and even the crazed disheveled furies for the first time would weep and the soot-filled air would clear just enough for her the lost bride to step through the image of herself and be seen in the light as everyone knows this was the first great poem which was followed by days of sitting around in the houses of friends with his head back his eyes closed trying to will her return but finding only himself again and again trapped in the chill of his loss and finally without a word taking off to wander the hills outside of town where he stayed until he had shaken the image of love and put in its place the world as he wished it would be urging its shape and measure into speech of such newness that the world was swayed and trees suddenly appeared in the bare place where he spoke and lifted their limbs and swept the tender grass with the gowns of their shade and stones weightless for once came and set themselves there and small animals lay in the miraculous fields of grain and aisles of corn and slept the voice of light had come forth from the body of fire and each thing rose from its depths and shone as it never had and that was the second great poem which no one recalls anymore the third and greatest came into the world as the world out of the unsayable invisible source of all longing to be it came as things come that will perish to be seen or heard awhile like the coating of frost or the movement of wind and then no more it came in the middle of sleep like a door to the infinite and circled by flame came again at the moment of waking and sometimes remote and small it came as a vision with trees by a weaving stream brushing the bank with their violet shade with somebody ’ s limbs scattered among the matted mildewed leaves nearby with his severed head rolling under the waves breaking the shifting columns of light into a swirl of slivers and flecks it came in a language untouched by pity in lines lavish and dark where death is reborn and sent into the world as a gift so the future with no voice of its own nor hope of ever becoming more than it will be might mourn

in memory of nancy tow spiegel before he put his important question to an oracle croesus planned to test all the famous soothsayers sending runners half around the world to delphi dodona amphiarius branchidae and ammon so as to determine the accuracy of their words his challenge not to say anything of his future but rather what he was doing in his capital sardis eating an unlikely meal of lamb and tortoise exactly one hundred days after messengers had set out this posed a challenge then of far space not of time of seeing past dunes and rock fortresses of flying freighted above caravans and seas of sightedness as it were in the present construed as a darkened room croesus of lydia sought by this means to gauge the unplumbed limits of what each oracle knew hesitant to entrust his fate to any unable to divine lamb and tortoise stewing in a bronze pot when only the pythia of apollo at delphi correctly answered from her cleft her tripod just the lens for seeing into the royal ego she put his mind to rest but not before speaking in her smoke-stung voice i count the grains of sand on the beach and the sea ’ s depth i know the speech of the dumb and i hear those without voice we know this because those present wrote it down of the king ’ s crucial questions however there is nothing we have no word the histories are silent my analyst whose office on madison was narrow as an anchorite ’ s cave would sit behind me as i stared up at her impassive ceiling as the uptown buses slushed all the way to harlem and i would recount with many hesitations and asides the play i was starring in whose acts were as yet fluid though the whole loomed tragically enough she would listen bent over knitting or occasionally note some fact made less random by my tremulous soliloquy when much later i heard of her death after long cancer i walked across town and stood in front of her building trying to resurrect those afternoons that became the years we labored together toward a time without neurosis when i might work and raise a family and find peace find if not happiness exactly some surcease from pain what question had i failed to ask when the chance was mine when she who knew me so well could have answered let just one of those quicksilver hours be returned to me with my knowledge now of the world and not a boy ’ s with all that i have become a lighted room one hour to ask the question that burned once in a king ’ s throat the question of all questions the true source and center without which a soul must make do clap hands and sing

listen nephew when i opened the cantina at noon a triangle of sunlight was stretched out on the floor like a rug like a tired cat it flared in from the window through a small hole shaped like a yawn strange i thought and placed my hand before the opening but the sunlight did not vanish i pulled back the shutters and the room glowed but this pyramid of whiteness was simply brighter the sunlight around it appeared soiled like the bed sheet of a borracho amazed i locked the door closed the windows workers in from the fields knocked to be let in children peeked through the shutters but i remained silent i poured a beer at a table shuffled a pack of old cards and watched it cross the floor hang on the wall like a portrait like a calendar without numbers when a fly settled in the sunlight and disappeared in a wreath of smoke i tapped it with the broom spat on it the broom vanished the spit sizzled it is the truth little one i stood eye to blank eye and by misfortune this finger this pink stump entered the sunlight snapped off with a dry sneeze and fell to the floor as a gift to the ants who know me for what i gave
when i go into the garden there she is the specter holds up her arms to show that her hands are eaten off she is silent because of the agony there is blood on her face i can see she has done this to herself so she would not feel the other pain and it is true she does not feel it she does not even see me it is not she anymore but the pain itself that moves her i look and think how to forget how can i live while she stands there and if i take her life what will that make of me i can not touch her make her conscious it would hurt her too much i hear the sound all through the air that was her eating but it is on its own now completely separate from her i think i am supposed to look i am not supposed to turn away i am supposed to see each detail and all expression gone my god i think if paradise is to be here it will have to include her

nuing-kuiten my father ’ s friend was a lion sorcerer and walked on feet of hair people saw his spoor and said “ the sorcerer has visited us he is the one who treads on hair this big animal prowling was nuing-kuiten. ” he used to travel by night— he did not want to be seen for people might shoot at him and he might maul someone at night he could go unseen after other lion sorcerers who slink into our dwellings and drag out men the sorcerer lived with us hunting in a lion ’ s form until an ox fell prey to him then the boers rode out and shot my father ’ s friend but he fought those people off and came home to tell father how boers had wounded him he thought father did not know he was wounded in his lion form soon he would have to go for he lay in extreme pain if only he could take father and teach him his magic and songs father would walk in his craft sing his songs and remember him he died and my father sang “ men broke the string for me and made my dwelling like this men broke the string for me and now my dwelling is strange to me my dwelling stands empty because the string has broken and now my dwelling is a hardship for me ”
we never saw the ghost though he was there— we knew from the raindrops tapping on the eaves we never saw him and we didn ’ t care each day new sunshine tumbled through the air evenings the moonlight rustled in dark leaves we never saw the ghost though he was there if ever when the wind tousled our hair and prickled goosebumps up and down thin sleeves we never saw him and we didn ’ t care to step outside our room at night or dare click off the nightlight call it fear of thieves we never saw the ghost though he was there in sunlit dustmotes drifting anywhere in light-and-shadow such as the moon weaves we never saw him though and didn ’ t care until at last we saw him everywhere we told nobody everyone believes we never saw the ghost if he was there we never saw him and we didn ’ t care
a man with binoculars fixed a shape in the field and we stopped and saw the albino buck browsing in the oats—white dash on a page of green flick of a blade cutting paint to canvas it dipped its head and green effaced the white bled onto the absence that the buck was—animal erasure head up again its sugar legs pricked the turf pink antler prongs brushed at flies here in a field was the imagined world made visible—a mythical beast filling its rumen with clover until all at once it startled flagged its bright tail— auf wiedersehen surrender— and leapt away— a white tooth in the closing mouth of the woods
as he spoke we could hear ever more loudly the noise of the burning fires the flood of flames was coming nearer and nearer “ my father let me take you upon my shoulders and carry you with me the burden will be easy whatever happens you and i will experience it together peril or safety whichever it will be little iülus will come along beside me my wife will follow behind us and you my servants listen to what i say just as you leave the limits of the city there is a mound and the vestiges of a deserted temple of ceres and a cypress tree that has been preserved alive for many years by the piety of our fathers we will all meet there though perhaps by different ways and father you must carry in your arms the holy images of our household gods i coming so late from the fighting and the carnage can not presume to touch them until i have washed myself in running water. ” thus i spoke i take up the tawny pelt of a lion and cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it and bowing down i accept the weight of my father iülus puts his hand in mine and goes along beside me trying to match my steps as best he can trying his best to keep up my wife follows behind us a little way back so we all set out together making our way among the shadows and i who only just a little while ago had faced undaunted showers of arrows and swarms of enemy greeks am frightened by every slightest change in the air and startled by every slightest sound i hear fearful for whom i walk with and whom i carry and just as i had almost come to the gates and thought that i had almost gotten us free i thought i heard the sound of many feet and my father peering intently into the shadows cries out to me “ get away get away my son my son they are coming i see their shining shields i see the glow of their weapons in the dark ” i am alarmed and i don ’ t know what happened but some power hostile to me distracts my wits and i am confused and i lead us away by ways that i don ’ t know and off the familiar streets that together we are following and so o god some fate has taken away my wife creüsa my wife away from me what happened did she wander from the way that we were going did she fall back having to rest some place back there and so we left her i did not know i never saw her again and as we went i never turned to look behind and never thought of her until we reached the mound and ceres ’ ancient place when all of us at last had gotten there we all were there but she had vanished and she wasn ’ t there gone from her people gone from her child and her husband what men or gods in my frenzy did i not cry out against what worse sight had i seen i left ascanius and anchises and the household gods in the care of my companions and i found a secluded place deep in a valley for them to hide and i myself took up my shining weapons and sought the city again determined no matter what to look for my creüsa everywhere in troy i find my way along the walls and to and through the shadowed gate i ’ d left the city by carefully step by unseen step in the dark backwards the way i came i make my way everywhere as i go fills me with terror the very silence around me fills me with terror i make my way to my home in case in case she ’ s gone back there the greeks had invaded the house and set it on fire and through the house the fire rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof and the flames tower high above the burning house and the heat of the burning pours up into the sky and so i go on and once again i see the palace of priam and the citadel and in the empty courtyard of juno ’ s shrine there ’ s phoenix and dire ulysses guarding the treasures taken from everywhere from the shrines that the greeks had set fire to the golden bowls the holy altar-tables the stolen holy vestments boys and trembling matrons stand around i wander in the streets in my desperation calling out her name creüsa creüsa calling creüsa over and over again and as i went among the ruined buildings and through the streets of the ruined city lo suddenly there rose before my eyes the strangely magnified image of my wife i was stupefied my hair stood on end my voice got caught in my throat then she spoke to me and said words that altered everything for me “ beloved husband what use is it for you to persist in this insanity of grief what has happened here has happened not without the will of the gods the high lord of olympus does not permit creüsa to go with you to be with you on your journey where you are going long exile will be yours ploughing across vast seas until you come to hesperia where lydian tiber gently flows between rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy a king and wedded to a royal wife give up your weeping now for your creüsa i a dardan woman and the spouse of divine venus ’ s son will never see the scornful households of the myrmidons or the dolopians and never have to be a scullion slave in service to some greek matron the mighty mother keeps me on these shores farewell and may your care protect and cherish your child and mine. ” and having spoken thus the image of her receded into air leaving me weeping with so much still to say three times i tried to embrace her and to hold her three times the image clasped in vain escaped as if it were a breeze or on the wings of a vanishing dream and so the night being over i returned to my companions where they were when i got there i was amazed to see how many others women and men had come wretched survivors of the fall of the city to join us in the exile and the journey a heartbreaking company come from everywhere ready in their hearts and with their fortunes to follow me wherever i was going and now the morning star was rising over the highest ridges of ida bringing in the day that was beginning the danaans held the city behind the gates that they had locked there was no hope of further help and so i acknowledged this and taking up the burden of my father once again i sought the hills

i have always aspired to a more spacious form that would be free from the claims of poetry or prose and would let us understand each other without exposing the author or reader to sublime agonies in the very essence of poetry there is something indecent a thing is brought forth which we didn ’ t know we had in us so we blink our eyes as if a tiger had sprung out and stood in the light lashing his tail that ’ s why poetry is rightly said to be dictated by a daimonion though it ’ s an exaggeration to maintain that he must be an angel it ’ s hard to guess where that pride of poets comes from when so often they ’ re put to shame by the disclosure of their frailty what reasonable man would like to be a city of demons who behave as if they were at home speak in many tongues and who not satisfied with stealing his lips or hand work at changing his destiny for their convenience it ’ s true that what is morbid is highly valued today and so you may think that i am only joking or that i ’ ve devised just one more means of praising art with the help of irony there was a time when only wise books were read helping us to bear our pain and misery this after all is not quite the same as leafing through a thousand works fresh from psychiatric clinics and yet the world is different from what it seems to be and we are other than how we see ourselves in our ravings people therefore preserve silent integrity thus earning the respect of their relatives and neighbors the purpose of poetry is to remind us how difficult it is to remain just one person for our house is open there are no keys in the doors and invisible guests come in and out at will what i 'm saying here is not i agree poetry as poems should be written rarely and reluctantly under unbearable duress and only with the hope that good spirits not evil ones choose us for their instrument berkeley 1968

she was thinner with a mannered gauntness as she paused just inside the double glass doors to survey the room silvery cape billowing dramatically behind her what ’ s this i thought lifting a hand until she nodded and started across the parquet that ’ s when i saw she was dressed all in gray from a kittenish cashmere skirt and cowl down to the graphite signature of her shoes “ sorry i ’ m late ” she panted though she wasn ’ t sliding into the chair her cape tossed off in a shudder of brushed steel we kissed then i leaned back to peruse my blighted child this wary aristocratic mole “ how ’ s business ” i asked and hazarded a motherly smile to keep from crying out are you content to conduct your life as a cliché and what ’ s worse an anachronism the brooding artist ’ s demimonde near the rue princesse they had opened a gallery cum souvenir shop which featured fuzzy off-color monets next to his acrylics no doubt plus bearded african drums and the occasional miniature gargoyle from notre dame the great artist had carved at breakfast with a pocket knife “ tourists love us the parisians of course ” — she blushed— “ are amused though not without a certain admiration ... ” the chateaubriand arrived on a bone-white plate smug and absolute in its fragrant crust a black plug steaming like the heart plucked from the chest of a worthy enemy one touch with her fork sent pink juices streaming “ admiration for what ” wine a bloody pinot noir brought color to her cheeks “ why the aplomb with which we ’ ve managed to support our art ” —meaning he ’ d convinced her to pose nude for his appalling canvases faintly futuristic landscapes strewn with carwrecks and bodies being chewed by rabid cocker spaniels “ i ’ d like to come by the studio ” i ventured “ and see the new stuff. ” “ yes if you wish ... ” a delicate rebuff before the warning “ he dresses all in black now me he drapes in blues and carmine— and even though i think it ’ s kinda cute in company i tend toward more muted shades. ” she paused and had the grace to drop her eyes she did look ravishing spookily insubstantial a lipstick ghost on tissue or as if one stood on a fifth-floor terrace peering through a fringe of rain at paris ’ dreaming chimney pots each sooty issue wobbling skyward in an ecstatic oracular spiral “ and he never thinks of food i wish i didn ’ t have to plead with him to eat ... ” fruit and cheese appeared arrayed on leaf-green dishes i stuck with café crème “ this camembert ’ s so ripe ” she joked “ it ’ s practically grown hair ” mucking a golden glob complete with parsley sprig onto a heel of bread nothing seemed to fill her up she swallowed sliced into a pear speared each tear-shaped lavaliere and popped the dripping mess into her pretty mouth nowhere the bright tufted fields weighted vines and sun poured down out of the south “ but are you happy ” fearing i whispered it quickly “ what you know mother ” — she bit into the starry rose of a fig— “ one really should try the fruit here. ” i ’ ve lost her i thought and called for the bill
as if the sky during its emergence —when it bubbled its way up out of the sand cooled and then sublimed into vapor that blued the dank grey of the atmosphere— left a residue of cobalt behind to remind from where it had sprung into existence the water rising from this spring appears unearthly as only things close to earth born of earth can its blue deeper than the heart of a sapphire today when faced with such a spectacle we have as usual only two choices the paralysis of awe or the quick nonchalance of acceptance but what about the spaniards who came upon this spring before there was a platform lined with inner tubes before there were wooden walkways elevated to slow their impending rot before their was a faux beach its sand stolen from the spring ’ s center did they run in with their clothes on convinced that this was the fountain of youth did they laugh believing themselves drunk mad asleep—dead maybe that afternoon late summer we did not swim chose instead to wander out to the edge of the walkway not a word between the two of us only the wind unlike us mere mortals the trees had long since been impressed preferring instead to maintain postures incompatible with the work of sycophants
little poems in prose i. the exodus august 3 1492 1. the spanish noon is a blaze of azure fire and the dusty pilgrims crawl like an endless serpent along treeless plains and bleached highroads through rock-split ravines and castellated cathedral-shadowed towns 2. the hoary patriarch wrinkled as an almond shell bows painfully upon his staff the beautiful young mother ivory-pale well-nigh swoons beneath her burden in her large enfolding arms nestles her sleeping babe round her knees flock her little ones with bruised and bleeding feet “ mother shall we soon be there ” 3. the youth with christ-like countenance speaks comfortably to father and brother to maiden and wife in his breast his own heart is broken 4. the halt the blind are amid the train sturdy pack-horses laboriously drag the tented wagons wherein lie the sick athirst with fever 5. the panting mules are urged forward with spur and goad stuffed are the heavy saddlebags with the wreckage of ruined homes 6. hark to the tinkling silver bells that adorn the tenderly-carried silken scrolls 7. in the fierce noon-glare a lad bears a kindled lamp behind its network of bronze the airs of heaven breathe not upon its faint purple star 8. noble and abject learned and simple illustrious and obscure plod side by side all brothers now all merged in one routed army of misfortune 9. woe to the straggler who falls by the wayside no friend shall close his eyes 10. they leave behind the grape the olive and the fig the vines they planted the corn they sowed the garden-cities of andalusia and aragon estremadura and la mancha of granada and castile the altar the hearth and the grave of their fathers 11. the townsman spits at their garments the shepherd quits his flock the peasant his plow to pelt with curses and stones the villager sets on their trail his yelping cur 12. oh the weary march oh the uptorn roots of home oh the blankness of the receding goal 13. listen to their lamentation they that ate dainty food are desolate in the streets they that were reared in scarlet embrace dunghills they flee away and wander about men say among the nations they shall no more sojourn there our end is near our days are full our doom is come 14. whither shall they turn for the west hath cast them out and the east refuseth to receive 15. o bird of the air whisper to the despairing exiles that to-day to-day from the many-masted gayly-bannered port of palos sails the world-unveiling genoese to unlock the golden gates of sunset and bequeath a continent to freedom ii treasures 1. through cycles of darkness the diamond sleeps in its coal-black prison 2. purely incrusted in its scaly casket the breath-tarnished pearl slumbers in mud and ooze 3. buried in the bowels of earth rugged and obscure lies the ingot of gold 4. long hast thou been buried o israel in the bowels of earth long hast thou slumbered beneath the overwhelming waves long hast thou slept in the rayless house of darkness 5. rejoice and sing for only thus couldst thou rightly guard the golden knowledge truth the delicate pearl and the adamantine jewel of the law iii the sower 1. over a boundless plain went a man carrying seed 2. his face was blackened by sun and rugged from tempest scarred and distorted by pain naked to the loins his back was ridged with furrows his breast was plowed with stripes 3. from his hand dropped the fecund seed 4. and behold instantly started from the prepared soil blade a sheaf a springing trunk a myriad-branching cloud-aspiring tree its arms touched the ends of the horizon the heavens were darkened with its shadow 5. it bare blossoms of gold and blossoms of blood fruitage of health and fruitage of poison birds sang amid its foliage and a serpent was coiled about its stem 6. under its branches a divinely beautiful man crowned with thorns was nailed to a cross 7. and the tree put forth treacherous boughs to strangle the sower his flesh was bruised and torn but cunningly he disentangled the murderous knot and passed to the eastward 8. again there dropped from his hand the fecund seed 9. and behold instantly started from the prepared soil a blade a sheaf a springing trunk a myriad-branching cloud-aspiring tree crescent shaped like little emerald moons were the leaves it bare blossoms of silver and blossoms of blood fruitage of health and fruitage of poison birds sang amid its foilage and a serpent was coiled about its stem 10. under its branches a turbaned mighty-limbed prophet brandished a drawn sword 11. and behold this tree likewise puts forth perfidious arms to strangle the sower but cunningly he disentangles the murderous knot and passes on 12. lo his hands are not empty of grain the strength of his arm is not spent 13. what germ hast thou saved for the future o miraculous husbandman tell me thou planter of christhood and islam tell me thou seed-bearing israel iv the test 1. daylong i brooded upon the passion of israel 2. i saw him bound to the wheel nailed to the cross cut off by the sword burned at the stake tossed into the seas 3. and always the patient resolute martyr face arose in silent rebuke and defiance 4. a prophet with four eyes wide gazed the orbs of the spirit above the sleeping eyelids of the senses 5. a poet who plucked from his bosom the quivering heart and fashioned it into a lyre 6. a placid-browed sage uplifted from earth in celestial meditation 7. these i saw with princes and people in their train the monumental dead and the standard-bearers of the future 8. and suddenly i heard a burst of mocking laughter and turning i beheld the shuffling gait the ignominious features the sordid mask of the son of the ghetto v. currents 1. vast oceanic movements the flux and reflux of immeasurable tides oversweep our continent 2. from the far caucasian steppes from the squalid ghettos of europe 3. from odessa and bucharest from kief and ekaterinoslav 4. hark to the cry of the exiles of babylon the voice of rachel mourning for her children of israel lamenting for zion 5. and lo like a turbid stream the long-pent flood bursts the dykes of oppression and rushes hitherward 6. unto her ample breast the generous mother of nations welcomes them 7. the herdsman of canaan and the seed of jerusalem ’ s royal shepherds renew their youth amid the pastoral plains of texas and the golden valleys of the sierras vi the prophet 1. moses ben maimon lifting his perpetual lamp over the path of the perplexed 2. hallevi the honey-tongued poet wakening amid the silent ruins of zion the sleeping lyre of david 3. moses the wise son of mendel who made the ghetto illustrious 4. abarbanel the counselor of kings aicharisi the exquisite singer ibn ezra the perfect old man gabirol the tragic seer 5. heine the enchanted magician the heart-broken jester 6.yea and the century-crowned patriarch whose bounty engirdles the globe — 7. these need no wreath and no trumpet like perennial asphodel blossoms their fame their glory resounds like the brazen-throated cornet 8. but thou—hast thou faith in the fortune of israel wouldst thou lighten the anguish of jacob 9. then shalt thou take the hand of yonder caftaned wretch with flowing curls and gold-pierced ears 10. who crawls blinking forth from the loathsome recesses of the jewry 11. nerveless his fingers puny his frame haunted by the bat-like phantoms of superstition is his brain 12. thou shalt say to the bigot “ my brother ” and to the creature of darkness “ my friend. ” 13 and thy heart shall spend itself in fountains of love upon the ignorant the coarse and the abject 14. then in the obscurity thou shalt hear a rush of wings thine eyes shall be bitten with pungent smoke 15. and close against thy quivering lips shall be pressed the live coal wherewith the seraphim brand the prophets vii chrysalis 1. long long has the orient jew spun around his helplessness the cunningly enmeshed web of talmud and kabbala 2. imprisoned in dark corners of misery and oppression closely he drew about him the dust-gray filaments soft as silk and stubborn as steel until he lay death-stiffened in mummied seclusion 3. and the world has named him an ugly worm shunning the blessed daylight 4. but when the emancipating springtide breathes wholesome quickening airs when the sun of love shines out with cordial fires lo the soul of israel bursts her cobweb sheath and flies forth attired in the winged beauty of immortality

to me one silly task is like another i bare the shambling tricks of lust and pride this flesh will never give a child its mother — song like a wing tears through my breast my side and madness chooses out my voice again again i am the chosen no hand saves the shrieking heaven lifted over men not the dumb earth wherein they set their graves
winter is fallen early on the house of stare birds in reverberating flocks haunt its ancestral box bright are the plenteous berries in clusters in the air still is the fountain ’ s music the dark pool icy still whereupon a small and sanguine sun floats in a mirror on into a west of crimson from a south of daffodil ’ tis strange to see young children in such a wintry house like rabbits ’ on the frozen snow their tell-tale footprints go their laughter rings like timbrels ’ neath evening ominous their small and heightened faces like wine-red winter buds their frolic bodies gentle as flakes in the air that pass frail as the twirling petal from the briar of the woods above them silence lours still as an arctic sea light fails night falls the wintry moon glitters the crocus soon will open grey and distracted on earth ’ s austerity thick mystery wild peril law like an iron rod — yet sport they on in spring ’ s attire each with his tiny fire blown to a core of ardour by the awful breath of god

lo ’ t is a gala night within the lonesome latter years an angel throng bewinged bedight in veils and drowned in tears sit in a theatre to see a play of hopes and fears while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres mimes in the form of god on high mutter and mumble low and hither and thither fly— mere puppets they who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo that motley drama—oh be sure it shall not be forgot with its phantom chased for evermore by a crowd that seize it not through a circle that ever returneth in to the self-same spot and much of madness and more of sin and horror the soul of the plot but see amid the mimic rout a crawling shape intrude a blood-red thing that writhes from out the scenic solitude it writhes —it writhes —with mortal pangs the mimes become its food and seraphs sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued out—out are the lights—out all and over each quivering form the curtain a funeral pall comes down with the rush of a storm while the angels all pallid and wan uprising unveiling affirm that the play is the tragedy “ man ” and its hero the conqueror worm

by a route obscure and lonely haunted by ill angels only where an eidolon named night on a black throne reigns upright i have reached these lands but newly from an ultimate dim thule— from a wild weird clime that lieth sublime out of space—out of time bottomless vales and boundless floods and chasms and caves and titan woods with forms that no man can discover for the tears that drip all over mountains toppling evermore into seas without a shore seas that restlessly aspire surging unto skies of fire lakes that endlessly outspread their lone waters—lone and dead — their still waters—still and chilly with the snows of the lolling lily by the lakes that thus outspread their lone waters lone and dead — their sad waters sad and chilly with the snows of the lolling lily — by the mountains—near the river murmuring lowly murmuring ever — by the grey woods —by the swamp where the toad and the newt encamp — by the dismal tarns and pools where dwell the ghouls — by each spot the most unholy— in each nook most melancholy — there the traveller meets aghast sheeted memories of the past— shrouded forms that start and sigh as they pass the wanderer by— white-robed forms of friends long given in agony to the earth—and heaven for the heart whose woes are legion ’ t is a peaceful soothing region— for the spirit that walks in shadow ’ t is—oh ’ t is an eldorado but the traveller travelling through it may not—dare not openly view it never its mysteries are exposed to the weak human eye unclosed so wills its king who hath forbid the uplifting of the fring 'd lid and thus the sad soul that here passes beholds it but through darkened glasses by a route obscure and lonely haunted by ill angels only where an eidolon named night on a black throne reigns upright i have wandered home but newly from this ultimate dim thule
for gloria imagining on a long walk between two greek towns those turkish prisoners the guidebook says were sabred where they crowded together on the stone dock and then imagining—still walking anxious to see some worker in the fields or another old couple like the last one he riding the donkey she leading it in black — the greeks whom the germans shot and as the road after rising leads down again at last to the town by the bay imagining all the feuds given license by the civil war the woman whose husband forgive him his faults now steps dead through the doorway one night imagining imagining—is there a way out of this brooding ahead to the hollow thud of the first dirt thrown down on his coffin what is the word any tongue can make good for the boy— let someone else name his country— who speaks to his sleeping wife when he leaves at night his brother tagging after him one puny gun between them if his cold spirit can still speak her name tomorrow won ’ t she feel even more alone aeneas carried a high purpose on the point of his sword a city needed founding if not here then in another place this road though dips past two ordinary houses and then the disco casting a stale abandoned shade sharp-edged to one side and i descend— through hot odd-angled streets lined with those plane trees whose name ’ s so bland and awkward translated out of sunny greek or spanish— to the huge white plane-tree-shaded square at the cafe in the open air i order lemonade from the waitress who has just served the little table crowded round by seven or eight a changing group—the eager interpreter talking and listening at the same time three young women dressed up and even in this small town the four military men from the foreign ship offshore out of uniform but with an apparent eye for swag some future day talking of small deals clever braveries travels they exact smiles and attentions and never have they seen such a pretty town as this never the three women listen hard to the roared harsh sounds of the odd tongue then impatiently to the interpreter while the military men wait what could such noise be about do these men love the ways ours do do they like their women to speak to them in bed to say what they want to say it the turkish prisoners had been led outside with the lie that they ’ d be freed inside the smoky small bar so they can watch without being watched young men are bitter imagining the weight of medals coming one by one to the dusty window-glass then returning toward the far unlit interior the lemonade arrives at last in the pretty hands of the waitress she puts it on my white table under the plane trees and hurries away to be near the laughing group foreign men who one day may bring something new to the town or something old for gloria
the woman is perfected her dead body wears the smile of accomplishment the illusion of a greek necessity flows in the scrolls of her toga her bare feet seem to be saying we have come so far it is over each dead child coiled a white serpent one at each little pitcher of milk now empty she has folded them back into her body as petals of a rose close when the garden stiffens and odors bleed from the sweet deep throats of the night flower the moon has nothing to be sad about staring from her hood of bone she is used to this sort of thing her blacks crackle and drag
gaily bedight a gallant knight in sunshine and in shadow had journeyed long singing a song in search of eldorado but he grew old— this knight so bold— and o ’ er his heart a shadow— fell as he found no spot of ground that looked like eldorado and as his strength failed him at length he met a pilgrim shadow— ‘ shadow ’ said he ‘ where can it be— this land of eldorado ’ ‘ over the mountains of the moon down the valley of the shadow ride boldly ride ’ the shade replied — ‘ if you seek for eldorado ’
i asked for much i received much i asked for much i received little i received next to nothing and between a few umbrellas opened indoors a pair of shoes by mistake on the kitchen table o wrong wrong—it was my nature i was hard-hearted remote i was selfish rigid to the point of tyranny but i was always that person even in early childhood small dark-haired dreaded by the other children i never changed inside the glass the abstract tide of fortune turned from high to low overnight was it the sea responding maybe to celestial force to be safe i prayed i tried to be a better person soon it seemed to me that what began as terror and matured into moral narcissism might have become in fact actual human growth maybe this is what my friends meant taking my hand telling me they understood the abuse the incredible shit i accepted implying so i once thought i was a little sick to give so much for so little whereas they meant i was good clasping my hand intensely — a good friend and person not a creature of pathos i was not pathetic i was writ large like a queen or a saint well it all makes for interesting conjecture and it occurs to me that what is crucial is to believe in effort to believe some good will come of simply trying a good completely untainted by the corrupt initiating impulse to persuade or seduce— what are we without this whirling in the dark universe alone afraid unable to influence fate— what do we have really sad tricks with ladders and shoes tricks with salt impurely motivated recurring attempts to build character what do we have to appease the great forces and i think in the end this was the question that destroyed agamemnon there on the beach the greek ships at the ready the sea invisible beyond the serene harbor the future lethal unstable he was a fool thinking it could be controlled he should have said i have nothing i am at your mercy
see this house how dark it is beneath its vast-boughed trees not one trembling leaflet cries to that watcher in the skies— ‘ remove remove thy searching gaze innocent of heaven ’ s ways brood not moon so wildly bright on secrets hidden from sight. ’ ‘ secrets ’ sighs the night-wind ‘ vacancy is all i find every keyhole i have made wails a summons faint and sad no voice ever answers me only vacancy. ’ ‘ once once … ’ the cricket shrills and far and near the quiet fills with its tiny voice and then hush falls again mute shadows creeping slow mark how the hours go every stone is mouldering slow and the least winds that blow some minutest atom shake some fretting ruin make in roof and walls how black it is beneath these thick boughed trees
why hast thou nothing in thy face thou idol of the human race thou tyrant of the human heart the flower of lovely youth that art yea and that standest in thy youth an image of eternal truth with thy exuberant flesh so fair that only pheidias might compare ere from his chaste marmoreal form time had decayed the colours warm like to his gods in thy proud dress thy starry sheen of nakedness surely thy body is thy mind for in thy face is nought to find only thy soft unchristen ’ d smile that shadows neither love nor guile but shameless will and power immense in secret sensuous innocence o king of joy what is thy thought i dream thou knowest it is nought and wouldst in darkness come but thou makest the light where ’ er thou go ah yet no victim of thy grace none who e ’ er long ’ d for thy embrace hath cared to look upon thy face
it was homemade and primitive like pulling a tooth with a string and a slamming door like taking out an appendix by kerosene light where dogs wandered in and out the dirt-floored room nothing for the pain that everyone wanted to examine the twisted heart they thought they could shout back into place moaning and fluttering their fleshy hands on the wind on the wail of the soul possessed they certified her in a manner inquisitional frantic when she held to the grip of darkness grimly determined to wait the thing out something learned from movie sheriffs white hats ghostly in the moonlight when she would not answer though they conjured her by heaven and by the all mighty names they knew they laid hands on her and shouted down the well of her eyes many tongues twisted in their mouths when she went leaving behind only the smallest tooth of wickedness
two women with the same claim came to the feet of the wise king two women but only one baby the king knew someone was lying what he said was let the child be cut in half that way no one will go empty-handed he drew his sword then of the two women one renounced her share this was the sign the lesson suppose you saw your mother torn between two daughters what could you do to save her but be willing to destroy yourself—she would know who was the rightful child the one who couldn ’ t bear to divide the mother
dim vales—and shadowy floods— and cloudy-looking woods whose forms we can ’ t discover for the tears that drip all over huge moons there wax and wane— again—again—again— every moment of the night— forever changing places— and they put out the star-light with the breath from their pale faces about twelve by the moon-dial one more filmy than the rest a kind which upon trial they have found to be the best comes down—still down—and down with its centre on the crown of a mountain ’ s eminence while its wide circumference in easy drapery falls over hamlets over halls wherever they may be— o ’ er the strange woods—o ’ er the sea— over spirits on the wing— over every drowsy thing— and buries them up quite in a labyrinth of light— and then how deep —o deep is the passion of their sleep in the morning they arise and their moony covering is soaring in the skies with the tempests as they toss like—almost any thing— or a yellow albatross they use that moon no more for the same end as before videlicet a tent— which i think extravagant its atomies however into a shower dissever of which those butterflies of earth who seek the skies and so come down again never-contented things have brought a specimen upon their quivering wings
sing now the heavy furniture of the fall the journey ’ s ending strong aeneas bears deep on his shoulders all the dark wood chairs and tables of destruction bruising blunt they force his feet on up the war-scraped hills past raped dead temples all achilles kills litters the trail of sofa legs with other endings of houses further up gods sit changing their own upholsteries of deceit ordaining shelves and benches as the goal of his dim voyage sometimes arrows drawn on chair backs point the way they must go on signs that some corridor of destiny is reserving him a threshold aeneas weeps at wind or passion but steadfastly keeps carrying battered merchandise marked rome in one direction pondering it all
an old man in concord forgets to go to morning service he falls asleep while reading vergil and dreams that he is aeneas at the funeral of pallas an italian prince the sun is blue and scarlet on my page and yuck-a yuck-a yuck-a yuck-a rage the yellowhammers mating yellow fire blankets the captives dancing on their pyre and the scorched lictor screams and drops his rod trojans are singing to their drunken god ares their helmets catch on fire their files clank by the body of my comrade—miles of filings now the scythe-wheeled chariot rolls before their lances long as vaulting poles and i stand up and heil the thousand men who carry pallas to the bird-priest then the bird-priest groans and as his birds foretold i greet the body lip to lip i hold the sword that dido used it tries to speak a bird with dido ’ s sworded breast its beak clangs and ejaculates the punic word i hear the bird-priest chirping like a bird i groan a little “ who am i and why ” it asks a boy ’ s face though its arrow-eye is working from its socket “ brother try o child of aphrodite try to die to die is life. ” his harlots hang his bed with feathers of his long-tailed birds his head is yawning like a person the plumes blow the beard and eyebrows ruffle face of snow you are the flower that country girls have caught a wild bee-pillaged honey-suckle brought to the returning bridegroom—the design has not yet left it and the petals shine the earth its mother has at last no help it is itself the broken-winded yelp of my phoenician hounds that fills the brush with snapping twigs and flying can not flush the ghost of pallas but i take his pall stiff with its gold and purple and recall how dido hugged it to her while she toiled laughing—her golden threads a serpent coiled in cypress now i lay it like a sheet it clinks and settles down upon his feet the careless yellow hair that seemed to burn beforehand left foot right foot—as they turn more pyres are rising armored horses bronze and gagged italians who must file by ones across the bitter river when my thumb tightens into their wind-pipes the beaks drum their headman ’ s cow-horned death ’ s-head bites its tongue and stiffens as it eyes the hero slung inside his feathered hammock on the crossed staves of the eagles that we winged our cost is nothing to the lovers whoring mars and venus father ’ s lover now his car ’ s plumage is ready and my marshals fetch his squire acoctes white with age to hitch aethon the hero ’ s charger and its ears prick and it steps and steps and stately tears lather its teeth and then the harlots bring the hero ’ s charms and baton—but the king vain-glorious turnus carried off the rest “ i was myself but ares thought it best the way it happened. ” at the end of time he sets his spear as my descendants climb the knees of father time his beard of scalps his scythe the arc of steel that crowns the alps the elephants of carthage hold those snows turms of numidian horse unsling their bows the flaming turkey-feathered arrows swarm beyond the alps “ pallas ” i raise my arm and shout “ brother eternal health farewell forever. ” church is over and its bell frightens the yellowhammers as i wake and watch the whitecaps wrinkle up the lake mother ’ s great-aunt who died when i was eight stands by our parlor sabre “ boy it ’ s late vergil must keep the sabbath. ” eighty years it all comes back my uncle charles appears blue-capped and bird-like phillips brooks and grant are frowning at his coffin and my aunt hearing his colored volunteers parade through concord laughs and tells her english maid to clip his yellow nostril hairs and fold his colors on him it is i. i hold his sword to keep from falling for the dust on the stuffed birds is breathless for the bust of young augustus weighs on vergil ’ s shelf it scowls into my glasses at itself

upon a bank easeless with knobs of gold beneath a canopy of noonday smoke i saw a measureless beast morose and bold with eyes like one from filthy dreams awoke who stares upon the daylight in despair for very terror of the nothing there this beast in one flat hand clutched vulture-wise a glittering image of itself in jet and with the other groped about its eyes to drive away the dreams that pestered it and never ceased its coils to toss and beat the mire encumbering its feeble feet sharp was its hunger though continually it seemed a cud of stones to ruminate and often like a dog let glittering lie this meatless fare its foolish gaze to sate once more convulsively to stoop its jaw or seize the morsel with an envious paw indeed it seemed a hidden enemy must lurk within the clouds above that bank it strained so wildly its pale stubborn eye to pierce its own foul vapours dim and dank till wearied out it raved in wrath and foam daring that nought invisible to come ay and it seemed some strange delight to find in this unmeaning din till suddenly as if it heard a rumour on the wind or far away its freer children cry lifting its face made-quiet there it stayed till died the echo its own rage had made that place alone was barren where it lay flowers bloomed beyond utterly sweet and fair and even its own dull heart might think to stay in livelong thirst of a clear river there flowing from unseen hills to unheard seas through a still vale of yew and almond trees and then i spied in the lush green below its tortured belly one like silver pale with fingers closed upon a rope of straw that bound the beast squat neck to hoary tail lonely in all that verdure faint and deep he watched the monster as a shepherd sheep i marvelled at the power strength and rage of this poor creature in such slavery bound fettered with worms of fear forlorn with age its blue wing-stumps stretched helpless on the ground while twilight faded into darkness deep and he who watched it piped its pangs asleep

all greece hates the still eyes in the white face the lustre as of olives where she stands and the white hands all greece reviles the wan face when she smiles hating it deeper still when it grows wan and white remembering past enchantments and past ills greece sees unmoved god ’ s daughter born of love the beauty of cool feet and slenderest knees could love indeed the maid only if she were laid white ash amid funereal cypresses
azure ’ tis i come from elysian shores to hear the waves break on sonorous steps and see again the sunrise full of ships rising from darkness upon golden oars my solitary arms call on the kings whose salty beards amused my silver hands i wept they sang of triumphs in far lands and gulfs fled backward upon watery wings i hear the trumpet and the martial horn that wield the rhythm of the beating blade the song of rowers binding the tumult and the gods exalting on the prow with scorn their ancient smile that the slow waves insult hold out their sculptured arms to my sad shade from the french of paul valéry

i tell you that i see her still at the dark entrance of the hall one gas lamp burning near her shoulder shone also from her other side where hung the long inaccurate glass whose pictures were as troubled water an immense shadow had its hand between us on the floor and seemed to hump the knuckles nervously a giant crab readying to walk or a blanket moving in its sleep you will remember with a smile instructed by movies to reminisce how strict her corsets must have been how the huge arrangements of her hair would certainly betray the least impassionate displacement there it was no rig for dallying and maybe only marriage could derange that queenly scaffolding— as when a great ship coming home coasts in the harbor dropping sail and loosing all the tackle that had laced her in the long lanes ... i know we need not draw this figure out but all that whalebone came from whales and all the whales lived in the sea in calm beneath the troubled glass until the needle drew their blood i see her standing in the hall where the mirror ’ s lashed to blood and foam and the black flukes of agony beat at the air till the light blows out
ianthe you are call ’ d to cross the sea a path forbidden me remember while the sun his blessing sheds upon the mountain-heads how often we have watcht him laying down his brow and dropt our own against each other ’ s and how faint and short and sliding the support what will succeed it now mine is unblest ianthe nor will rest but on the very thought that swells with pain o bid me hope again o give me back what earth what without you not heaven itself can do— one of the golden days that we have past and let it be my last or else the gift would be however sweet fragile and incomplete
you can shuffle and scuffle and scold you can rattle the knockers and knobs or batter the doorsteps with buckets of gold till the deputy-governor sobs you can sneak up a suitable plank in a frantic endeavor to see— but what do they do in the commonwealth bank when the big door bangs at three listen in the cellars listen in the vaults can ’ t you hear the tellers turning somersaults can ’ t you hear the spectres of inspectors and directors dancing with the phantoms in a dead man ’ s waltz some are ghosts of nabobs poverty and stray bobs midas and his mistress mammon and his wife other ones are sentries guarding double entries long-forgotten double-dealing troubled double-life down among the pass-books money lent and spent down among the forests of the four per cent. where the ledgers meet and moulder and the overdrafts grow older and the phantoms shrug a shoulder when you ask ’ em for the rent they are bogies of grandfather ’ s cheques they are spectres of buried accounts they are crinoline sweethearts with pearls on their necks demanding enormous amounts they are payment for suppers and flowers for diamonds to banish a tear for sweet pretty ladies in opulent hours and tombstones and bailiffs and beer down in the bowels of the bank the ledgers lie rank upon rank the debts of the ages come out of their pages the bones of old loans creak and clank— oh if you could peep through the door to day at a quarter past four you ’ d find all the ghosts at their usual posts and you wouldn ’ t sign cheques any more
he didn ’ t know king kleomenis he didn ’ t dare— he just didn ’ t know how to tell his mother a thing like that ptolemy ’ s demand to guarantee their treaty that she too go to egypt and be held there as a hostage— a very humiliating indecorous thing and he would be about to speak yet always hesitate would start to tell her yet always stop but the magnificent woman understood him she ’ d already heard some rumors about it and she encouraged him to get it out and she laughed saying of course she ’ d go happy even that in her old age she could be useful to sparta still as for the humiliation—that didn ’ t touch her at all of course an upstart like the lagid couldn ’ t possibly comprehend the spartan spirit so his demand couldn ’ t in fact humiliate a royal lady like herself mother of a spartan king
i far-sighted into yesterday they stand gripping their charters and speeches the presidents and kings masters of unconscious evil their deputies are here — judges robed executioners steely and triumphant and stunned at their feet the beheaded the betrayed healed and hallowed now in this grave sorrow of wax ii we enter adjust to the gloom to the lighting that plays on the painted staring faces we think to ourselves murmur to the one standing beside us '' how compellingly strange these people are and yet familiar to the world we left behind us the street and the household ... '' these are the people whose names we learned whose lives we studied whose thoughts we have become each lighted stage with its play of the lost and the violent — comedians and stuntmen heroes transfixed in purpose we pause to read once more in deliberate bald summation what art wax and history have made of the dead something more than a mirror less than a telling likeness an ideality slick with blood iii how easily in the live heat of truth and summer these actors wilt and perish henry of church and england is here savage and senile still laced in his armor his lopped and stunted wives stand grouped around him bismark in his iron corset endlessly dividing europe wilhelm that struttng dwarf abject in abdication and here the fatal mischief of sarajevo — how swift a fire how long a burning came of the archduke 's festive ride his shot and bloodied tunic and no more telling prophecy in the wake of armistice than that one dated cartoon with its hooded sentry and its graveyard owl '' it has been six years ... '' how easily a puff of smoke a square of burnt cloth a shocked cry can change the world and leave it neither worse nor better iv here is a man thief or martyr hanged at damascus gate with a hook through his gut he swung seared by the sun and kissed by the night and maybe one of the market women brought him water and maybe not — once seen by the sultan 's watch she might have lost her hands as in the time of richelieu certain men the crown accused were exposed in iron baskets like plucked birds they fouled their nests starved and blackened until they died and the city lived with their cries their rank mortality night and day the hook is black and crescent the body swings inert as if asleep and dreaming the guidebook tells us the man survived his hook and lived it does n't say how long v

cash in place of an earthy kingdom wolfe montcalm on the plain below quebec the one dying the other condemned to follow we pass reading from face to face from book to book uneasy that among these celebrations so many rigged transactions have gone unquestioned and all our wigged colonials our franklins conspiring with their strongbox keys and profitable lightning — that so much ink and dust and shuffled paper conceals their tidy pilferings their purity and blunted wrath were there rooms in this house each with its tabled motions and false partitions might furnish a history one slow truth at a time but never in our late arrival have we stilled confusion to learn how great a folly follows in the wake of fathers from their deliberate violence we come to our own lamed misrule its slick banality and crime without passion to ike to kennedy and ford golfers and temporizers to perennial candidate nixon whose cheek was never turned out of his sleek arrest he steps towards us as if to greet a voter — a fixed ferocious smile on the blue jowls brushed with powder vi nothing we have painted and framed in our passage — neither prayer nor courtship nor solace of sleep and self — escaped the grip of these iron centuries here in a row of lighted cases a few artifacts are on display no comfort to us now in that familiar edged interrogation ... but the biting persuasion of chains and collars of inching racks fire tongs and screws — in the eyes of kings and churchmen the instruments of truth and whosoever might trespass on whatever lawful ground would find for his solace a more forbidding marriage as once in a stone embrasure i saw a belt for virgins a hinged and rusted clasp with a lock and a slit for functions — all but one imagine with what shocked dismay a man might grope for his sweetness there and all too soon awaken clamped in his ecstasy vii another room with smaller people and thinner walls here the queen plays with cryptic cards hands out assignments '' you are the hunchback '' she says `` and you the hangman and you the jack of trades '' she pares and quarters her venomous apple calls for her mirror and her image smiles to watch her glass fill up with poison beauty is sleeping the prince is awake and far in the forest a frostlight winks from the sugar house the witch is singing and lighting her oven the woodcutter's wayward children watch they break and nibble the sweetened glass the images whisper and darken conspiring in their tumbled tale of fretful spinners of drones and dumble- dores wise eggs that speak and shatter and it looks as if the painted sleepers in this dreamworks are about to awaken the crafty queen and her players the musical mice the drones and the spinners — all in a scampering rush to find the nearest exit ... as the looking glass draws us deeper into the bright play of shadows that melt and run and freeze ... the mad mad romp of children of rabbits and dwarfs who keep their strange hilarity in so much horror viii call those from underneath the sold and trodden their slow and sweating sons elevate and crown them patch up their clothing and wash their skins rub their faces until they glow and their dull eyes brighten give them speeches to learn and eloquent gestures power to grasp laws to break and mend great heat and furious labor bring on in them this drear and mystical change at first a swinish fattening and then a leaner look and in their eyes the same feral glitter of their late unkindly masters they sicken as they flourish until like wickless candles they slump and totter their heads are rotten their famous flesh has run to sticky pools they die and sleep afoot their ignorant hearts grown wise in the ways of wax ix in all these wax memorials only appearance changes crowned heads and axes fall thugs and jailors rise and displace each other in this long uneasy walk we have littered with claims and captions the heroes are always welcomed are propped and shaven their ruddy male composure is sleeker than ever though the great sleeves and brutal collars give way to softer buttons the paper in official hands rustles as before though it is only paper paper in cheap supply and not the bleached fell of a difficult sheep and yet the neat persuasions are seen to tighten and each new litigation is a running noose ... all that increases all that gluts and fattens matures its option here honor to thieves and merchants long life to the butcher and for the just petitioner — sweeper of the hallways scapegoat and discard — no reply but the rote of legal fictions to which he listens now as in the days of pontinus stricken with understanding x the rooms are large and numerous and we in our restless striding find that they never end it is as if we had lived here always captive to this endless and malign instruction had served those mighty tempers and learned too well these never-blotted names and we live here still sharing these murderous spaces this blood-haunted silence and once we started from sleep terrorized and whimpering to see in the luminous sunken light the head of a long-forgotten agent a face like a father one who might have comforted but can not see or hear us bald vacant and amused xi all is as it must or might be here at the story 's end — the jury dismissed the witness excused and all are guilty to have come so far walked so easily through so much anguish pride and stupor of evil and yet we are standing still locked in an echoing foyer in so driven so brief an itinerary a day will stand for a decade an inch for a mile — so far has a painted fiction served us these bones in their period costumes would bend if we touched them their flesh would yield and all arrangements topple but see how they bring toward us the old sustaining gestures — a stride an arm outstretched — the furrows in the smiles deepen and the red lips smear great captains command obedient ranks go down in all these propped assemblies i know a substance neither wax nor wholly flesh — a tried and mortal nature familiar as the warmth in my hand xii were we not lost condemned to repeat these names and to honor their crimes a voice among us might cry out speak to those who are stopped here whose faces are these that melt and run children and guardians giants and dwarfs — oh people people ... who are these heroes and where are their victims we who are standing here with our guidebooks suddenly closed and all the exits darkened ... until another gallery opens or the sun through that skylight strikes us all — souls in torment pilgrims and doting fathers ...

tired of his dark dominion ... —george meredith it was something i ’ d overheard one evening at a party a man i liked enormously saying to a mutual friend a woman wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips that belled below each breast “ well i ’ ve always preferred athens greece seems to me a country of the day—rome i ’ m afraid strikes me as being a city of the night ... ” of course i knew instantly just what he meant— not simply because i love standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening as the constellations pulse low in the roman sky the whole mind of night that i know so well shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite almost divine irony no and it wasn ’ t only that rome was my city of the night that it was here i ’ d chosen to live when i grew tired of my ancient life as the underground man and it wasn ’ t that rome ’ s darkness was of the kind that consoles so many vacancies of the soul my rome with its endless history of falls ... no it was that this dark was the deep sensual dark of the dreamer this dark was like the violet fur spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of the she-wolf—all the sequins above in sequence the white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians a dark like the polished back of a mirror the pool of the night scalloped and hanging above me the inverted reflection of a last odd narcissus ... one night my friend nico came by close to three a.m.—as we drank a little wine i could see the black of her pupils blown wide the spread ripples of the opiate night ... and nico pulled herself close to me her mouth almost touching my mouth as she sighed “ look ... ” and deep within the pupil of her left eye almost like the mirage of a ship ’ s distant hanging lantern rocking with the waves i could see at the most remote end of the receding circular hallway of her eye there at its doorway at the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil a tiny dangling crucifix— silver lit by the ragged shards of starlight reflecting in her as quietly as pain as simply as pain ... some years later i saw nico on stage in new york singing inside loosed sheets of shattered light a fluid kaleidoscope washing over her—the way any naked emerging venus steps up along the scalloped lip of her shell innocent and raw as fate slowly obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple deadly love of sexual sincerity ... i didn ’ t bother to say hello i decided to remember the way in rome out driving at night she ’ d laugh as she let her head fall back against the cracked red leather of my old lancia ’ s seats the soft black wind fanning her pale chalky hair out along its currents ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves the sad lucent malevolence of the heavens falling ... both of us racing silently as light nowhere then forever ... into the mind of the roman night
for desiray kierra chee in the last days of the fourth world i wished to make a map for those who would climb through the hole in the sky my only tools were the desires of humans as they emerged from the killing fields from the bedrooms and the kitchens for the soul is a wanderer with many hands and feet the map must be of sand and can ’ t be read by ordinary light it must carry fire to the next tribal town for renewal of spirit in the legend are instructions on the language of the land how it was we forgot to acknowledge the gift as if we were not in it or of it take note of the proliferation of supermarkets and malls the altars of money they best describe the detour from grace keep track of the errors of our forgetfulness the fog steals our children while we sleep flowers of rage spring up in the depression monsters are born there of nuclear anger trees of ashes wave good-bye to good-bye and the map appears to disappear we no longer know the names of the birds here how to speak to them by their personal names once we knew everything in this lush promise what i am telling you is real and is printed in a warning on the map our forgetfulness stalks us walks the earth behind us leav- ing a trail of paper diapers needles and wasted blood an imperfect map will have to do little one the place of entry is the sea of your mother ’ s blood your father ’ s small death as he longs to know himself in another there is no exit the map can be interpreted through the wall of the intestine—a spiral on the road of knowledge you will travel through the membrane of death smell cooking from the encampment where our relatives make a feast of fresh deer meat and corn soup in the milky way they have never left us we abandoned them for science and when you take your next breath as we enter the fifth world there will be no x no guidebook with words you can carry you will have to navigate by your mother ’ s voice renew the song she is singing fresh courage glimmers from planets and lights the map printed with the blood of history a map you will have to know by your intention by the language of suns when you emerge note the tracks of the monster slayers where they entered the cities of artificial light and killed what was killing us you will see red cliffs they are the heart contain the ladder a white deer will greet you when the last human climbs from the destruction remember the hole of shame marking the act of abandoning our tribal grounds we were never perfect yet the journey we make together is perfect on this earth who was once a star and made the same mistakes as humans we might make them again she said crucial to finding the way is this there is no beginning or end you must make your own map

i have had to learn the simplest things last which made for difficulties even at sea i was slow to get the hand out or to cross a wet deck the sea was not finally my trade but even my trade at it i stood estranged from that which was most familiar was delayed and not content with the man ’ s argument that such postponement is now the nature of obedience that we are all late in a slow time that we grow up many and the single is not easily known it could be though the sharpness the achiote i note in others makes more sense than my own distances the agilities they show daily who do the world ’ s businesses and who do nature ’ s as i have no sense i have done either i have made dialogues have discussed ancient texts have thrown what light i could offered what pleasures doceat allows but the known this i have had to be given a life love and from one man the world tokens but sitting here i look out as a wind and water man testing and missing some proof i know the quarters of the weather where it comes from where it goes but the stem of me this i took from their welcome or their rejection of me and my arrogance was neither diminished nor increased by the communication 2 it is undone business i speak of this morning with the sea stretching out from my feet

i had come to the house in a cave of trees facing a sheer sky everything moved —a bell hung ready to strike sun and reflection wheeled by when the bare eyes were before me and the hissing hair held up at a window seen through a door the stiff bald eyes the serpents on the forehead formed in the air this is a dead scene forever now nothing will ever stir the end will never brighten it more than this nor the rain blur the water will always fall and will not fall and the tipped bell make no sound the grass will always be growing for hay deep on the ground and i shall stand here like a shadow under the great balanced day my eyes on the yellow dust that was lifting in the wind and does not drift away

the mind is an ancient and famous capital the mind is a city like london smoky and populous it is a capital like rome ruined and eternal marked by the monuments which no one now remembers for the mind like rome contains catacombs aqueducts amphitheatres palaces churches and equestrian statues fallen broken or soiled the mind possesses and is possessed by all the ruins of every haunted hunted generation ’ s celebration “ call us what you will we are made such by love. ” we are such studs as dreams are made on and our little lives are ruled by the gods by pan piping of all seeking to grasp or grasping all of the grapes and by the bow-and-arrow god cupid piercing the heart through suddenly and forever dusk we are to dusk returning after the burbing after the gold fall the fallen ash the bronze scattered and rotten after the white null statues which are winter sleep and nothingness when will the houselights of the universe light up and blaze for it is not the sea which murmurs in a shell and it is not only heart at harp o ’ clock it is the dread terror of the uncontrollable horses of the apocalypse running in wild dread toward arcturus—and returning as suddenly ... the fear and dread of the mind of the others —the others were the despots of despair— the river ’ s freshness sailed from unknown sources— ... they snickered giggled laughed aloud at last they mocked and marvelled at the statue which was a caricature as strained and stiff and yet a statue of self-love —since self-love was to them truly my true love how then was i a stillness of nervousness so nervous a caricature did they suppose self-love was unrequited or betrayed they thought i had fallen in love with my own face and this belief became the night-like obstacle to understanding all my unbroken suffering my studious self-regard the pain of hope the torment of possibility how then could i have expected them to see me as i saw myself within my gaze or see that being thus seemed as a toad a frog a wen a mole knowing their certainty that i was only a monument a monster who had fallen in love with himself alone how could i have told them what was in me within my heart trembling and passionate within the labyrinth and caves of my mind which is like every mind partly or wholly hidden from itself the words for what is in my heart and in my mind do not exist but i must seek and search to find amid the vines and orchards of the vivid world of day approximate images imaginary parallels for what is my heart and dark within my mind comparisons and mere metaphors for all of them are substitutes both counterfeit and vague they are at most deceptive resemblances false in their very likeness like the sons who are alike and kin and more unlike and false because they seem the father ’ s very self but each one is —although begotten by the same forbears—himself the unique self each one is unique like every other one and everything older or younger nevertheless a passionate nonesuch who has before has been do you hear do you see do you understand me now and how the words for what is my heart do not exist the river was the emblem of all beauty all ... the river was the abundant belly of beauty itself the river was the dream space where i walked the river was itself and yet it was—flowing and freshening— a self anew another self or self renewed at every tick of eternity and by each glint of light mounting or sparkling descending to shade and black —had i but told them my heart told how it was taunted at noon and pacified at dusk at starfall midnight strong in hope once more ever in eagerness jumping like joy would they have heard how could they how when what they knew was like the grass simple and certain known through the truth of touch another form and fountain of falsehood ’ s fecundity— gazing upon their faces as they gazed could they have seen my faces as whores who are holy and deified as priestesses of hope —the sacred virgins of futurity— promising dear divinity precisely because they were disfigured ducks who might become and be and ever beloved white swans noble and beautiful could they have seen how my faces were bonfires of worship and vigil blazes of adoration and hope —surely they would have laughed again renewed their scorn giggled and snickered cruel surely have said this is the puerile mania of the obsessed the living logic of the lunatic i was the statue of their merriment dead and a death pharoah and monster forsaken and lost ... my faces were my apes my apes became performers in the sundays of their parks buffoons or clowns in the farce or comedy when they took pleasure in knowing that they were not like me ... i waited like obsession in solitude the sun ’ s white terror tore and roared at me the moonlight almond white at night whether awake or sleeping arrested me and sang softly haunted unlike the sun but as the sun withheld from me or took away despair or peace making me once more with thought of what had never been before——
late in the cold night wakened and heard wind and lay with eyes closed and silent knowing these words how bodiless they are this darkness empty under my roof and the panes rattling roughed by wind and so lay and imagined somewhere far off black seas heavy-shouldered plunging on sand and the ebb off-streaming and thunder forever so lying bethought me friend what traffic ghouls have or this be legend in low inland hollows of the earth under shade of moon the night moaning and bitter frost and feared the riches of my bones long given into this earth should tumble to their hands no girl or ghost beside me and i lonely remembering gardens lilac scent or twilight descending late in summer on that town i lay and found my years departed from me and feared the cold bed and the wind absurdly alone with silence and the trick of tears

book six chapter xliv i in hill-towns from san fernando to mayagüez the same sunrise stirred the feathered lances of cane down the archipelago ’ s highways the first breeze rattled the spears and their noise was like distant rain marching down from the hills like a shell at your ears in the cool asphalt sundays of the antilles the light brought the bitter history of sugar across the squared fields heightening towards harvest to the bleached flags of the indian diaspora the drizzling light blew across the savannah darkening the racehorses ’ hides mist slowly erased the royal palms on the crests of the hills and the hills themselves the brown patches the horses had grazed shone as wet as their hides a skittish stallion jerked at his bridle marble-eyed at the thunder muffling the hills but the groom was drawing him in like a fisherman wrapping the slack line under one fist then with the other tightening the rein and narrowing the circle the sky cracked asunder and a forked tree flashed and suddenly that black rain which can lose an entire archipelago in broad daylight was pouring tin nails on the roof hammering the balcony i closed the french window and thought of the horses in their stalls with one hoof tilted watching the ropes of rain i lay in bed with current gone from the bed-lamp and heard the roar of wind shaking the windows and i remembered achille on his own mattress and desperate hector trying to save his canoe i thought of helen as my island lost in the haze and i was sure i ’ d never see her again all of a sudden the rain stopped and i heard the sluicing of water down the guttering i opened the window when the sun came out it replaced the tiny brooms of palms on the ridges on the red galvanized roof of the paddock the wet sparkled then the grooms led the horses over the new grass and exercised them again and there was a different brightness in everything in the leaves in the horses ’ eyes ii i smelt the leaves threshing at the top of the year in green january over the orange villas and military barracks where the plunketts were the harbour flecked by the wind that comes with christmas edged with the arctic that was christened vent noël it stayed until march and with luck until easter it freshened the cedars waxed the laurier-cannelle and hid the african swift i smelt the drizzle on the asphalt leaving the morne it was the smell of an iron on damp cloth i heard the sizzle of fried jackfish in oil with their coppery skin i smelt ham studded with cloves the crusted accra the wax in the varnished parlour come in come in the arm of the morris chair sticky with lacquer i saw a sail going out and a sail coming in and a breeze so fresh it lifted the lace curtains like a petticoat like a sail towards ithaca i smelt a dead rivulet in the clogged drains iii ah twin-headed january seeing either tense a past they assured us born in degradation and a present that lifted us up with the wind ’ s noise in the breadfruit leaves with such an elation that it contradicts what is past the cannonballs of rotting breadfruit from the battle of the saints the asterisks of bulletholes in the brick walls of the redoubt i lived there with every sense i smelt with my eyes i could see with my nostrils chapter xlv i one side of the coast plunges its precipices into the atlantic turns require wide locks since the shoulder is sharp and the curve just misses a long drop over the wind-bent trees and the rocks between the trees there is a wide view of dennery with its stone church and raw ochre cliffs at whose base the african breakers end across the flecked sea whose combers veil and unveil the rocks with their lace the next port is dakar the uninterrupted wind thuds under the wings of frigates you see them bent from a force that has crossed the world tilting to find purchase in the sudden downdrafts of its current the breeze threshed the palms on the cool december road where the comet hurtled with empty leopard seats so fast a man on a donkey trying to read its oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo played when it screeched round a bridge and began to ascend away from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend where hector suddenly saw the trotting piglet and thought of plunkett ’ s warning as he heard it screel with the same sound that the tires of the comet made rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel the rear wheels spin to a dead stop like a helm the piglet trots down the safer side of the road lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame hector had both hands on the wheel his head was bowed under the swaying statue of the madonna of the rocks her smile swayed under the blue hood and when her fluted robe stilled the smile stayed on her dimpled porcelain she saw in the bowed man the calm common oval of prayer the head ’ s usual angle over the pew of the dashboard her lifted palm small as a doll ’ s from its cerulean mantle indicated that he had prayed enough to the lace of foam round the cliff ’ s altar that now if he wished he could lift his head but he stayed in the same place the way a man will remain when mass is finished not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross forehead heart and shoulders swiftly and then kneel facing the altar he bowed in endless remorse for her mercy at what he had done to achille his brother but his arc was over for the course of every comet is such the fated crescent was printed on the road by the scorching tires a salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped the wheel on the flecked sea the uninterrupted wind herded the long african combers and whipped the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead ii drivers leant over the rail one seized my luggage off the porter ’ s cart the rest burst into patois with gestures of despair at the lost privilege of driving me then turned to other customers in the evening pastures horses grazed their hides wet with light that shot its lances over the combers i had the transport all to myself “ you all set good a good pal of mine died in that chariot of his called the comet. ” he turned in the front seat spinning the air with his free hand i sat sprawled out in the back discouraging talk with my crossed feet “ you never know when eh i was at the airport that day i see him take off like a rocket i always said that thing have too much horsepower and so said so done the same hotel chief correct ” i saw the coastal villages receding as the highway ’ s tongue translated bush into forest the wild savannah into moderate pastures that other life going in its “ change for the best ” its peace paralyzed in a postcard a concrete future ahead of it all in the cinder-blocks of hotel development with the obsolete craft of the carpenter as i sensed in the neat marinas the fisherman ’ s phantom old oarlocks and rusting fretsaw my craft required the same crouching care the same crabbed natural devotion of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame or planed an elegant canoe its time was gone with the spirit in the wood as wood grew obsolete and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete i watched the afternoon sea didn ’ t i want the poor to stay in the same light so that i could transfix them in amber the afterglow of an empire preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks to that blue bus-stop didn ’ t i prefer a road from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax of colonial travellers the measured prose i read as a schoolboy that cove with its brown shallows there praslin that heron had they waited for me to develop my craft why hallow that pretence of preserving what they left the hypocrisy of loving them from hotels a biscuit-tin fence smothered in love-vines scenes to which i was attached as blindly as plunkett with his remorseful research art is history ’ s nostalgia it prefers a thatched roof to a concrete factory and the huge church above a bleached village the gap between the driver and me increased when he said “ the place changing eh ” where an old rumshop had gone but not that river with its clogged shadows that would make me a stranger “ all to the good ” he said i said “ all to the good ” then “ whoever they are ” to myself i caught his eyes in the mirror we were climbing out of micoud hadn ’ t i made their poverty my paradise his back could have been hector ’ s ferrying tourists in the other direction home the leopard seat scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests he had driven his burnt-out cargo tired of sweat who longed for snow on the moon and didn ’ t have to face the heat of that sinking sun who knew a climate as monotonous as this one could only produce from its unvarying vegetation flashes of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies that shot from the verge that their dried calabashes of fake african masks for a fake achilles rattled with the seeds that came from other men ’ s minds so let them think that who needed art in this place where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines and the fishermen had such adept thumbs such grace these people had but what they envied most in them was the calypso part the caribbean lilt still in the shells of their ears like the surf ’ s rhythm until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt like any eden and they sighed at the sign hewannorra iounalao the gold sea flat as a credit-card extending its line to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else greece or hawaii now the goddamn souvenir felt absurd excessive the painted gourds the shells their own faces as brown as gourds mine felt as strange as those at the counter feeling their bodies change iii change lay in our silence we had come to that bend where the trees are warped by wind and the cliffs raw shelve surely to foam “ is right here everything end ” the driver said and rammed open the transport door on his side then mine “ anyway chief the view nice. ” i joined him at the gusting edge “ his name was hector. ” the name was bent like the trees on the precipice to point inland in its echo a man-o ’ -war screamed on the wind the driver moved off for a piss then shouted over his shoulder “ a road-warrior he would drive like a madman when the power took he had a nice woman maybe he died for her. ” for her and tourism i thought the driver shook himself zipping then hoisting his crotch “ crazy but a gentle fellow anyway with a very good brain. ” cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain across serengeti cut to the spraying fans drummed by a riderless stallion its wild mane scaring the scamander cut to a woman ’ s hands clenched towards her mouth with no sound cut to the wheel of a chariot ’ s spiked hubcap cut to the face of his muscling jaw then flashback to achille hurling a red tin and a cutlass next a vase with a girl ’ s hoarse whisper echoing “ omeros ” as in a conch-shell cut to a shield of silver rolling like a hubcap rewind in slow motion myrmidons gathering by a village river with lances for oars cut to the surpliced ocean droning its missal cut a crane hoisting a wreck a horse nosing the surf then shuddering its neck he ’ d paid the penalty of giving up the sea as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed for the taxi-business he was making money but all of that money was making him ashamed of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf hustling passengers he missed the uncertain sand under his feet he sighed for the trough of a wave and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans castries was corrupting him with its roaring life its littered market with too many transport vans competing castries had been his common-law wife who like helen he had longed for from a distance and now he had both but a frightening discontent hollowed his face to find that the sea was a love he could never lose made every gesture violent ramming the side-door shut raking the clutch he drove as if driven by furies but furies paid the rent a man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother mer was both mother and sea in his lost canoe he had said his prayers but now he was in another kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new stereo its endless garages where he could not whip off his shirt hearing the conch ’ s summoning note chapter xlvi i hector was buried near the sea he had loved once not too far from the shallows where he fought achille for a tin and helen he did not hear the sea-almond ’ s moan over the bay when philoctete blew the shell nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud nor a sail rattling to rest as its day ’ s work was over and its mate gauging depth bent over the gunwale then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough when it was their turn to lie quiet as hector lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth ’ s trough to sleep under the piled conchs through every weather on the violet-wreathed mound crouching for his friend to hear achille whispered about their ancestral river and those things he would recognize when he got there his true home forever and ever and ever forever compère then philoctete limped over and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder to anchor his sorrow seven seas and helen did not come nearer achille had carried an oar to the church and propped it outside with the red tin now his voice strengthened he said “ mate this is your spear ” and laid the oar slowly the same way he had placed the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier the day the african swift and its shadow raced and this was the prayer that achille could not utter “ the spear that i give you my friend is only wood vexation is past i know how well you treat her you never know my admiration when you stood crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe with the plates of your chest like a shield i would say any enemy so was a compliment ’ cause no african ever hurled his wide seine at the bay by which he was born with such beauty you hear me men did not know you like me all right sleep good good night. ” achille moved philoctete ’ s hand then he saw helen standing alone and veiled in the widowing light then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin to her helen nodded a wind blew out the sun ii pride set in helen ’ s face after this like a stone bracketed with hector ’ s name her lips were incised by its dates in parenthesis she seemed more stern more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed the hot street of the village like a distant sail on the horizon grief heightened her when she smiled it was with such distance that it was hard to tell if she had heard your condolence it was the child ma kilman told them that made her more beautiful iii the rites of the island were simplified by its elements which changed places the grooved sea was achille ’ s garden the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense of the sea and philoctete on his height often heard in a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches on the blue heights at sunrise doing the same work as philoctete clearing his plot just as at sunset smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if from his enamel pot the woodsmoke smelt of a regret that men can not name on the charred field the massive sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers and the great indigo dusk slowly plumed down devouring the still leaves igniting the firefly huts lifting the panicky egret to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves take in the spars of its sails then with quick-pricking head anchor itself shiftingly and lift its question again at night the island reversed its elements the heron of a quarter-moon floated from hector ’ s grave rain rose upwards from the sea and the corrugated iron of the sea glittered with nailheads ragged plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers over the furrows of philoctete ’ s garden a chorus of aged ancestors and straw and rustling surrounded every house in the village with its back garden with its rank midden of rusted chamber pots rotting nets and the moon ’ s cold basin they sounded when they shook after the moonlit meridian of their crossing like the night-surf they gazed in silence at the shadows of their lamplit children at philoctete groaning and soaking the flower on his shin with hot sulphur cleaning its edges with yellow vaseline and gripping his knee squeezing rags from the basin at night when yards are asleep and the broken line of the surf hisses like philo “ bon dieu aie waie my sin is this sore ” the old plantains suffer and shine chapter xlvii i islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath of a cauldron a sibylline cure the citron sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half dipped its divining rod the white spray of the thorn which the swift bends lightly waited for a black hand to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand ma kilman in a black hat with its berried fringe eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step of the rumshop ’ s back door closed it and rammed the hinge tight the bolt caught a finger and with that her instep arch twisted and she let out a soft catholic curse then crossed herself she closed the gate the asphalt sweated with the heat the limp breadfruit leaves were thick over the fence her spectacles swam in their sweat she plucked an armpit the damn wig was badly made she was going to five o ’ clock mass to la messe and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze in the church ’ s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes she rolled down the elastic bands below the knees of her swollen stockings it was then that their vise round her calves reminded her of philoctete then numbering her beads she began her own litany of berries hail mary marigolds that stiffen their aureoles in the heights mild anemone and clear watercress the sacred heart of jesus pierced like the anthurium the thorns of logwood called the tree of life the aloe good for seizures the hole in the daisy ’ s palm with its drying blood that was the hole in the fisherman ’ s shin since he was pierced by a hook there was the pale roadside tisane of her malarial childhood there was this one for easing a birth-breach that one for a love-bath before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun ripened like her nipples in girlhood but what path led through nettles to the cure the furious sibyl couldn ’ t remember mimosa winced from her fingers shutting like jalousies at some passing evil when she reached for them the smell of incense lingers in her clothes inside the candle-flames are erect round the bier of the altar while she and her friends old-talk on the steps but the plant keeps its secret when her memory reaches shuttering in its fronds ii the dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings of perpetual freshness in which the bearded arms of a cedar held council between its gnarled toes grew the reek of an unknown weed its pronged flower sprang like a buried anchor its windborne odours diverted the bee from its pollen but its power rooted in bitterness drew her bowed head by the nose as a spike does a circling bull to approach it ma kilman lowered her head to one side and screened the stench with a cologned handkerchief the mulch it was rooted in carried the smell when it gangrened of philoctete ’ s cut in her black dress her berried black hat she climbed a goat-path up from the village past the stones with dried palms and conchs where the buried suffer the sun all day sunday while goats forage the new wreaths once more she pulled at the itch in her armpits nearly dropping her purse then she climbed hard up the rain-cracked path the bay closing behind her like a wound and rested everything that echoed repeated its outline a goat ’ s doddering bleat a hammer multiplying a roof and through the back yards a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat ma kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards to the thread of the smell one arm behind her back passing the cactus the thorn trees and then the wood appeared over her thick green the green almost black as her dress in its shade its border of flowers flecking the pasture with spray then she staggered back from the line of ants at her feet she saw the course they had kept behind her following her from church signalling a language she could not recognize iii a swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach centuries ago from its antipodal shore skimming the sea-troughs outdarting ospreys her luck held to its shadow she aimed to carry the cure that precedes every wound the reversible bight of benin was her bow her target the ringed haze of a circling horizon the star-grains at night made her hungrier the leafless sea with no house for her weariness sometimes she dozed in her flight for a swift ’ s second closing the seeds of her stare then ruddering straight the dry sea-flakes whitened her breast her feathers thinned then one dawn the day-star rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong east she saw the horned island and uncurled her claws with one frail cry since swifts are not given to song and fluttered down to a beach ejecting the seed in grass near the sand she nestled in dry seaweed in a year she was bleached bone all of that motion a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will but the vine grew its own wings out of the ocean it climbed like the ants the ancestors of achille the women carrying coals after the dark door slid over the hold as the weed grew in odour so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar where the flower was anchored at the mottled root as a lizard crawled upwards foot by sallow foot
at supper time an ondine ’ s narrow feet made dark tracks on the hearth like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire ’ s heat but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold the sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor she sat there with a silvered cedar knot for a low stool and i sat opposite my lips and eyelids hot in the heat of the fire piling on dry bark seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress i felt uneasiness as though firm sand had shifted under my feet in the wash of a wave i brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat but sat there crying her cold tears her blue lips quivering with cold and grief she blamed me for a thief saying that i had burned a piece of wood the tide washed up and i said no the tide had washed it out again and even so a piece of sodden wood was not so rare as polished agate stones or ambergris she stood and wrung her hair so that the water made a sudden splash on the round rug by the door i saw her go across the little footbridge to the beach after i threw the knot on the hot coals it fell apart and burned with a white flash a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke i beat it out with a poker in the soft ash now i am frightened on the shore at night and all the phosphorescent swells that rise come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes with a cold firelight in them and crooked driftwood writhes in dry sand when i pass should she return and bring her sisters with her the withdrawing tide would leave a long pool in my bed there would be nothing more of me this side the melting foamline of the latest wave
whirl up sea— whirl your pointed pines splash your great pines on our rocks hurl your green over us cover us with your pools of fir
the greeks are sitting on the beach wondering what to do when the war ends no one wants to go home back to that bony island everyone wants a little more of what there is in troy more life on the edge that sense of every day as being packed with surprises but how to explain this to the ones at home to whom fighting a war is a plausible excuse for absence whereas exploring one ’ s capacity for diversion is not well this can be faced later these are men of action ready to leave insight to the women and children thinking things over in the hot sun pleased by a new strength in their forearms which seem more golden than they did at home some begin to miss their families a little to miss their wives to want to see if the war has aged them and a few grow slightly uneasy what if war is just a male version of dressing up a game devised to avoid profound spiritual questions ah but it wasn ’ t only the war the world had begun calling them an opera beginning with the war ’ s loud chords and ending with the floating aria of the sirens there on the beach discussing the various timetables for getting home no one believed it could take ten years to get back to ithaca no one foresaw that decade of insoluble dilemmas—oh unanswerable affliction of the human heart how to divide the world ’ s beauty into acceptable and unacceptable loves on the shores of troy how could the greeks know they were hostages already who once delays the journey is already enthralled how could they know that of their small number some would be held forever by the dreams of pleasure some by sleep some by music
this circle holding the afternoon sky is a lake for summer business measured in stacked pairs of peeling oars whose dinghies all ship water beside it on the trampled grass a carrousel shakes and turns on an old world instrument the plink and plank and tinkle of a tune of plunging horses in fresh habiliment we catch the reins of enamel pegasus and lift the child until she is astride a purple beast where wrapping infant arms about his neck of wood she whirls in space and gallops off upon the turning wheel the horse climbs steadily the silver pole where cherubs hang then slides toward spinning earth she sees the moving heaven of winged babes rising to meet them rising she returns to where our faces staring in at hers fixed while her orbit whirls and sunlight burns recede to artifact as her vision blurs

it 's hard to get anywhere in utah without going through provo i ca n't tell you the number of times i went there as a teenager the number of times i drove into town in the early afternoon hungry and had to look around for a place to eat you do n't have to starve in provo but you eat at your own risk at no risk i would never have gone to provo on my own i went accompanied— for reasons almost too trivial—or personal—to mention there are moments when you simply must get into the car and drive and from salt lake there are only a few ways to go toward the great salt lake or toward the canyons and to get to zion or moab you had to pass through provo i remember the population because it went with the number of miles from outskirt to outskirt 45 miles 45,000 people 45 minutes keeping to the speed limit 45 to spend on a suit at a 45 discount ... there was nothing provo 's department store did not carry including pearl handled colt 45 's but for a wider selection of fire arms rifles with narrowing focal points with greater precision over vast distances you were better off next door o i guess it was n't that different from entering a thousand other american towns but this one made my flesh crawl i wanted to howl the men walked with their hands deep in their pockets the women were afraid to lift their eyes it was as if something terrible had happened or was about to happen i 'm not saying you have to love what you do in this life but it is n't nice to practice the silent treatment on strangers in the desert strangers who would have to be wondering where the other 44,990 people were since other than the one drowning potatoes in burning oil beside the grill in the luncheonette and the one behind the register and the three grim-faced parchment-skinned jack mormons hunkered over cups and the handful of impassive faces placed against the windows of one-story cinder-block houses there was no one in provo beyond the jackrabbits— glimpsed in abundance en route— who vanished as we crossed the town line and drove past the population sign or was it a warning in disguise there was something eerie in the air an absence i could not identify an immense single-pump gas station shimmering like a mirage in the heat took up a good part of the main drag i pull in step into the heat stunned the car is too hot to touch i needed gas but did n't want to get it there it meant digging up the attendant you know the lights in hospital corridors those are the lights in the gas station in provo they 're the kind of lights that show up whatever 's wrong with a face the kind of lights that make something wrong when there 's nothing wrong when i got there i was afraid it 's hard to put my finger on the precise reason why it 's not as though something ominous rose from the sidewalks or hell 's angels cycles were parked outside the luncheonette nothing like that nor can i say why even though there was almost no one on the street i felt watched while i slept fitfully in the tilt-back bucket seats someone scribbled obscenities on the headlights i felt drawn by destiny to this nadir you do n't want to provoke anyone in provo it 's that kind of place that kind of absence— the desert flattens out the plants draw in their antennae provo is not where you can hope to find boon companions it 's against the law to serve liquor in the bar and no one in the luncheonette looks up when you walk in these are the fallen sunk in ashes adrift in the smoke of unreason they have masturbated without shame they have coveted envied they have pocketed the tithe it 's hard to put it into words provo it 's more like a place without a name a desert stopover with the semblance of a town provo is a place where there is no reason to be a province that would never grow up to be a suburb like the backwaters where they exiled ovid and pascal only there is no water— just landscape shorn of green and tawny desert colors burned skyline hills like craggy impenetrable fortresses the rain gutters hiss in the dryness there 's a menacing blue tint on the rims of impinging mountains
once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door “ ’ tis some visitor ” i muttered “ tapping at my chamber door— only this and nothing more. ” ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow —vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost lenore— for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore— nameless here for evermore and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating “ ’ tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door — this it is and nothing more. ” presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer “ sir ” said i “ or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you ” —here i opened wide the door — darkness there and nothing more deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word “ lenore ” this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word “ lenore ” — merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before “ surely ” said i “ surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore— let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore — ’ tis the wind and nothing more ” open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door— perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door— perched and sat and nothing more then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore “ though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou ” i said “ art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore— tell me what thy lordly name is on the night ’ s plutonian shore ” quoth the raven “ nevermore. ” much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as “ nevermore. ” but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— till i scarcely more than muttered “ other friends have flown before— on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before. ” then the bird said “ nevermore. ” startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken “ doubtless ” said i “ what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of ‘ never—nevermore ’ ” but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore— what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking “ nevermore. ” this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom ’ s core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushion ’ s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o ’ er but whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o ’ er she shall press ah nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor “ wretch ” i cried “ thy god hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore ” quoth the raven “ nevermore. ” “ prophet ” said i “ thing of evil —prophet still if bird or devil — whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted— on this home by horror haunted—tell me truly i implore— is there—is there balm in gilead —tell me—tell me i implore ” quoth the raven “ nevermore. ” “ prophet ” said i “ thing of evil —prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above us—by that god we both adore— tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore— clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore. ” quoth the raven “ nevermore. ” “ be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend ” i shrieked upstarting— “ get thee back into the tempest and the night ’ s plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken —quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door ” quoth the raven “ nevermore. ” and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon ’ s that is dreaming and the lamp-light o ’ er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted—nevermore
is dead serious about this one having rehearsed it for two weeks they bring it right into the odd fellows meeting hall riding the backs of the trojan women in euripides ’ great wake they are swept up but the women of the chorus in black stockings and kerchiefs stand up bravely to it shawled arms thrash in a foam of hysterical voices shrieking seaweed on the wet flanks of a whale for each town has its cassandra who is a little crazy wed to some mystery or other and therefore painfully sensitive wiser than anyone but no one listens to her these days the terror reaches its red claws into back ward and living room alike for each town has its andromache who is too young with snub nose and children just out of school even she can not escape it from the bombed city she is led out weeping among the ambulances and each community has its tart its magical false helen or at least someone who looks like her in all the make-up she can muster the gorgeous mask of whatever quick-witted lie will keep her alive at least a little while longer on the crest of the bloody wave that dolorous mountain of wooden ships and water in whose memory the women bring us this huge gift horse this raging animal of a play no one dares to look in the eye for fear of what ’ s hidden there small ragdoll figures toppling over and over from every skyscraper and battlement hurtling men and women both mere gristle in the teeth of fate out over the sea of the audience our numb faces are stunned as andromache ’ s locked up there on the platform inside euripides ’ machine the women sway and struggle one foot at a time up the surging ladder of grief piled on grief strophe on antistrophe in every century the same the master tightens the screws heightens the gloss of each bitter scene and strikes every key each word rings out over our terrified heads like a brass trumpet for this gift is an accordion the biggest and mightiest of all as the glittering lacquered box heaves in and out sigh upon sigh at the topmost pitch a child falls through midnight in his frantically pink skin as the anguished queen protests the citizens in the chorus wail louder and louder the warriors depart without a glance backwards these captains of the world ’ s death enslaved as they are enslavers in a rain of willess atoms anonymity takes over utterly as the flaming city falls on this bare beach in the drab pinewood hall the reading club packs up to go scripts coffee cups black stockings husbands and wives pile into the waiting cars just as we expect life picks up and goes on but not art crouched back there like a stalled stallion stuffed in its gorgeous music box is the one gift that will not disappear but waits but bides its time and waits for the next time we open it that magical false structure inside whose artifice is the lesson buried alive of the grim machinations of the beautiful that always lead us to these eternally real lamentations real sufferings real cries
at first she thought the lump in the road was clay thrown up by a trucker ’ s wheel then beatrice saw the mess of feathers six or seven geese stood in the right-of-way staring at the blood their black heads rigid above white throats unmoved by passing wind or familiar violence they fixed their gaze on dead flesh and something more a bird on the wing it whirled in a thicket of fog that grew up from fields plowed and turned to winter it joined other spirits exhaled before dawn creatures that once had crept or flapped or crawled over the land beatrice had heard her mother tell of men who passed as spirits they hid in limestone caves by the river hooded themselves inside the curved wall the glistening rock then just at dark they appeared as if they had the power to split the earth open to release them white-robed faceless horned heads they advanced with torches over the water saying we are the ghosts of shiloh and bull run fight neighbors who watched at the bridge knew each man by his voice or limp or mended boots but said nothing allowed the marchers to pass on then they ran their skinny hounds to hunt other lives down ravines to save their skins another night from the carrion beetles spotted with red darker than blood who wait by the grave for the body ’ s return to the earth some years the men killed scores treed them in the sweetgums watched a man ’ s face flicker in the purple-black leaves then they burned the tree smoke from their fires still lay over the land where beatrice traveled out of this cloud the dead of the field spoke to her voices from the place where some voices never stop they took my boy down by sucarnochee creek he said “ gentlemen what have i done ” they says “ never mind what you have done we just want your damned heart. ” after they killed him i built up a little fire and laid out by him all night until the neighbors came in the morning i was standing there when they killed him down by sucarnochee creek i am a mighty brave woman but i was getting scared the way they were treating me throwing rocks on my house coming in disguise they come to my bed where i was laying and whipped me they dragged me out into the field so that the blood strung across the house and the fence and the cotton patch in the road and they ravished me then they went back into my house and ate the food on the stove they have drove me from my home it is over by desotoville on the other side in choctaw i had informed of persons whom i saw dressing in ku klux disguise had named the parties at the time i was divorced from dr. randall and had a school near fredonia about one month before the election some young men about the county came in the nighttime they said i was not a decent woman also i was teaching radical politics they whipped me with hickory withes the gashes cut through my thin dress through the abdominal wall i was thrown into a ravine in a helpless condition the school closed after my death from the fog above the bloody entrails of the bird the dead flew toward beatrice like the night crow whose one wing rests on the evening while the other dusts off the morning star they gave her such a look child what have you been up to while we were trying to keep body and soul together but never mind that now here ’ s what you must do tie a red flannel string around your waist plant your roots when the moon is dark remember your past and ours always remember who you are don ’ t let those men fool you about the ways of life even if blood must sign your name
somewhere in chelsea early summer and walking in the twilight toward the docks i thought i made out robinson ahead of me from an uncurtained second-story room a radio was playing there ’ s a small hotel a kite twisted above dark rooftops and slow drifting birds we were alone there he and i inhabiting the empty street under a sign for natural bloom cigars while lights clicked softly in the dusk from red to green he stopped and gazed into a window where a plaster venus modeling a truss looked out at eastbound traffic but robinson i knew was out of town he summers at a place in maine sometimes on fire island sometimes the cape leaves town in june and comes back after labor day and yet i almost called out “ robinson ” there was no chance just as i passed turning my head to search his face his own head turned with mine and fixed me with dilated terrifying eyes that stopped my blood his voice came at me like an echo in the dark “ i thought i saw the whirlpool opening kicked all night at a bolted door you must have followed me from astor place an empty paper floats down at the last and then a day as huge as yesterday in pairs unrolled its horror on my face until it blocked— ” running in sweat to reach the docks i turned back for a second glance i had no certainty there in the dark that it was robinson or someone else the block was bare the venus bathed in blue fluorescent light stared toward the river as i hurried west the lights across the bay were coming on the boats moved silently and the low whistles blew
i went by the druid stone that broods in the garden white and lone and i stopped and looked at the shifting shadows that at some moments fall thereon from the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing and they shaped in my imagining to the shade that a well-known head and shoulders threw there when she was gardening i thought her behind my back yea her i long had learned to lack and i said ‘ i am sure you are standing behind me though how do you get into this old track ’ and there was no sound but the fall of a leaf as a sad response and to keep down grief i would not turn my head to discover that there was nothing in my belief yet i wanted to look and see that nobody stood at the back of me but i thought once more ‘ nay i ’ ll not unvision a shape which somehow there may be. ’ so i went on softly from the glade and left her behind me throwing her shade as she were indeed an apparition— my head unturned lest my dream should fade
and what amazes me is that none of our modern inventions surprise or interest him even a little i tell him it is time he got his booster shots but then i realize i have no power over him whatsoever he becomes increasingly light-footed until i lose sight of him downtown between the federal building and the post office a registered nurse is taking her coffee break i myself needed a break so i sat down next to her at the counter `` do n't mind me '' i said '' i 'm just a hungry little gnostic in need of a sandwich '' this old line of mine had met with great success on any number of previous occasions i thought a deaf dumb and blind nurse sounds ideal but then i remembered that some of the earliest paleolithic office workers also feigned blindness when approached by nonoffice workers so i paid my bill and disappeared down an alley where i composed myself amidst the piles of outcast citizenry and burning barrels of waste and rot the plump rats darting freely the havoc of blown newspapers lay the little shroud of my lost friend small and gray and threadbare windworn by the ages of scurrying hither and thither battered by the avalanches and private tornadoes of just being a gnome but surely there were good times too and now rejuvenated by the wind the shroud moves forward hesitates dances sideways brushes my foot as if for a kiss and flies upward whistling a little-known ballad about the pitiful raw etiquette of the underworld
at midnight in the month of june i stand beneath the mystic moon an opiate vapor dewy dim exhales from out her golden rim and softly dripping drop by drop upon the quiet mountain top steals drowsily and musically into the universal valley the rosemary nods upon the grave the lily lolls upon the wave wrapping the fog about its breast the ruin moulders into rest looking like lethe see the lake a conscious slumber seems to take and would not for the world awake all beauty sleeps —and lo where lies irene with her destinies oh lady bright can it be right— this window open to the night the wanton airs from the tree-top laughingly through the lattice drop— the bodiless airs a wizard rout flit through thy chamber in and out and wave the curtain canopy so fitfully—so fearfully— above the closed and fringéd lid ’ neath which thy slumb ’ ring soul lies hid that o ’ er the floor and down the wall like ghosts the shadows rise and fall oh lady dear hast thou no fear why and what art thou dreaming here sure thou art come o ’ er far-off seas a wonder to these garden trees strange is thy pallor strange thy dress strange above all thy length of tress and this all solemn silentness the lady sleeps oh may her sleep which is enduring so be deep heaven have her in its sacred keep this chamber changed for one more holy this bed for one more melancholy i pray to god that she may lie forever with unopened eye while the pale sheeted ghosts go by my love she sleeps oh may her sleep as it is lasting so be deep soft may the worms about her creep far in the forest dim and old for her may some tall vault unfold— some vault that oft hath flung its black and wingéd pannels fluttering back triumphant o ’ er the crested palls of her grand family funerals— some sepulchre remote alone against whose portals she hath thrown in childhood many an idle stone— some tomb from out whose sounding door she ne ’ er shall force an echo more thrilling to think poor child of sin it was the dead who groaned within

moon-blind horse one of them was drinking soda water “ where are you going boy ” baby gauge said the horse swam back to the levee i was with them the boat drifted away a man said “ shadrach meshach and abednego ” iii hambone they tied his hind legs together and hung him in a tree with a log chain i saw them i was on baby gauge ’ s horse i threw a knife at the midget so they hung me up by the feet too i saw them break his neck i saw them pull his legs apart like a wishbone i wished the dead came back the midget stood on a bucket he reached up in the hog ’ s throat and pulled the heart out

it was baby gauge i said “ no it was the guitar player ’ s hand ” they swam to the bank i told them how i came by it born in the camp with six toes said “ it won ’ t take another fish off my lines ” i asked them “ you want to shake it ” baby gauge said “ no i want to spit on it ” we spit on the hand they left i wrapped it up in newspaper like fish i took it home i put it under jimmy ’ s pillow and

the cigar box he passed out the midget pulled a knife on me i picked up the hand he ran off on the way home i ran folks off the road when the truck came by the house the guitar player raised up in the bed he said “ give me my hand back ” when it was dark i tied fish line to it and hung it in the outhouse i sung to it the moon shined through the chink hole on the hand i took it down i threw it in a yellow jacket nest i stomped on it i took it to the palm reader i said “ sister read this ” a lot of evenings i listened for them i knew they would come back when a stranger got a drink at night i thought it was the holy ghost and sometimes a cloud went by like a three-legged dog and the thunder was someone with a shotgun letting him have it now the moon was a fifty-cent piece it was a belly i wanted to cut open when the flies got bad i kept the hand in the smokehouse v swimming at night the midget ran his finger across his neck the other one said “ give it back ” i waited in the outhouse i had a sawed-off shotgun the men rode off in the afternoon they sold fish they cleaned them at the pump the scales dried up on their faces they loaded the meat on stolen horses at night they rode up shooting pistols i slept with an ice pick under my pillow one night they rode up drunk the midget was sitting in the guitar player ’ s lap he said “ come on out ” they tied a bale of hay to baby gauge ’ s horse they poured coal oil on it they set it on fire they laughed the horse with the moon eye pranced around them he galloped home i carved wild hog out of a cypress knee i made it the handle i made four tushes out of the hambone i used the blade i brought out of the fire and sealed the pig with it was the blade i put the burning horse to sleep with i called the knife the holy ghost to make me go crazy i took all my clothes off and jumped down the hole in the outhouse i grabbed the yellow jacket nest and held it over my heart i pumped cold water over myself and wallowed in the mud i walked through the snake den barefooted i swam the river at midnight with the hand and a blue feather in my mouth and the holy ghost around my neck and the hooks caught in my arms they caught in my legs i cut the trot lines in two i saw the guitar player stealing the fish i was swimming beneath the shack under the sleeping midget with the fish bandit ’ s hand in my mouth i climbed through the trap door i crawled under the bed i cut the hooks out i believe i was snake bit i put the hand in the slop jar i reached up and tickled his nose with the feather he got out of bed he turned the lights

mouth i came up near the guitar player ’ s boat he was running the lines i swam to the other end of the trot line i put the hand on a hook i jerked the lines like a big fish the guitar player worked his way down he thought he had a good one i let go of the line he saw his left hand he screamed he fell out of the boat i swam back through the river i buried the knife in the levee i was sleeping in

would you rather hear the louche pun drawn from glory hole lip wrap or fingering or hear a tiny hammer striking wire would you rather see the molten birthing glass seat eros next to kronos for the banter i heard she ’ s yet unplowed — i heard your quiver dangled down — i heard you dwell in borrowed forms — love ’ s nothing but glimmer-to-wither dawn ’ s fireflies expired in this place we sift bounce the words like dice thrice dip a pipe into the magma o my stars lear gloucester walk into a bar debating again the color of bluffs or moors or cormorants like craquelure like damp tea leaf driftwood no peat steam no brined sand-apple ink were all your letters in fact suns forgotten after all that trouble — are those bellows blowing some a field of broken bottles fragments blue a tune invented to divert a girl

i thy soul shall find itself alone ’ mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone— not one of all the crowd to pry into thine hour of secrecy ii be silent in that solitude which is not loneliness—for then the spirits of the dead who stood in life before thee are again in death around thee—and their will shall overshadow thee be still iii the night tho ’ clear shall frown— and the stars shall look not down from their high thrones in the heaven with light like hope to mortals given— but their red orbs without beam to thy weariness shall seem as a burning and a fever which would cling to thee for ever iv now are thoughts thou shalt not banish now are visions ne ’ er to vanish from thy spirit shall they pass no more—like dew-drop from the grass v the breeze—the breath of god—is still— and the mist upon the hill shadowy—shadowy—yet unbroken is a symbol and a token— how it hangs upon the trees a mystery of mysteries
in legends of the jews lewis ginzberg writes that an egyptian princess hung a tapestry woven with diamonds and pearls above king solomon ’ s bed when the king wanted to rise he thought he saw stars and believing it was night slept on scaling ladders with buckets of white enamel i painted the stars and the moon on my windowpanes to hold back days and nights i yanked the telephone and stopped the wooden clock the weeks a lightning stroke desire turned to love with my blue diamond i sliced minutes in half and made days vanish fooling the hours i became so skillful at firmaments that miracles occurred a bearded comet moved across the room breeding no omens tearing no major kingdoms into small provinces but there it was reminding us that rock may spin and flare lifting the senses burning into sight you eased pale hands away i saw your shoulders recede through doorways watched your image fail with your famished smile i left our room with dream-filled eyes and standing in the sun i gazed at bricks and glass and saw suddenly flashing in stony light the stars and the moon

the amities of morning and the buxom habits of birds that swing a bell-bright city in their intelligent wings last night ’ s squall has drawn off like anger ’ s tide the remote and muffled waters beating solitudinous rocks and murmurous in the hidden parts ebbing and beating of the mind as some half-forgotten name the rain has withdrawn like the tents and the greeks like the hard-to-believe- in days of our childhood light moves the whole massed flotilla of morning kin to the upward flight of birds returning and brutality the hungers and the hatreds seem fabulous seem members the gouty rat and straggly root collaborate earth in wounds deaths decays— past hours its rutted crusts— with the billowy sky is the field- upon-field and all one of one master observing the various fruits somewhere a child in a cage inferior bodies making a passable road a girl passionate with pain an old man watching the earth escape like his once endless strengths his poems head- long and one fills with awe—as the town with morning every cranny the birds brimming fire- escapes and broken windows— that the earth like some wise breath never balked a many- membered bird-flight should include all must be a terrible good the eyes passing contracted from night and war the stars undertook finally emerge the topgallant of morning and those eyes roam free as the greeks wherever a drop of water is spindrift city of water gleaming there is home
there is a coal-black angel with a thick afric lip and he dwells like the hunted and harried in a swamp where the green frogs dip but his face is against a city which is over a bay of the sea and he breathes with a breath that is blastment and dooms by a far decree by night there is fear in the city through the darkness a star soareth on there ’ s a scream that screams up to the zenith then the poise of a meteor lone— lighting far the pale fright of the faces and downward the coming is seen then the rush and the burst and the havoc and wails and shrieks between it comes like the thief in the gloaming it comes and none may foretell the place of the coming—the glaring they live in a sleepless spell that wizens and withers and whitens it ages the young and the bloom of the maiden is ashes of roses— the swamp angel broods in his gloom swift is his messengers ’ going but slowly he saps their halls as if by delay deluding they move from their crumbling walls farther and farther away but the angel sends after and after by night with the flame of his ray— by night with the voice of his screaming— sends after them stone by stone and farther walls fall farther portals and weed follows weed through the town is this the proud city the scorner which never would yield the ground which mocked at the coal-black angel the cup of despair goes round vainly she calls upon michael the white man ’ s seraph was he for michael has fled from his tower to the angel over the sea who weeps for the woeful city let him weep for our guilty kind who joys at her wild despairing— christ the forgiver convert his mind

orpheus liked the glad personal quality of the things beneath the sky of course eurydice was a part of this then one day everything changed he rends rocks into fissures with lament gullies hummocks can ’ t withstand it the sky shudders from one horizon to the other almost ready to give up wholeness then apollo quietly told him “ leave it all on earth your lute what point why pick at a dull pavan few care to follow except a few birds of dusty feather not vivid performances of the past. ” but why not all other things must change too the seasons are no longer what they once were but it is the nature of things to be seen only once as they happen along bumping into other things getting along somehow that ’ s where orpheus made his mistake of course eurydice vanished into the shade she would have even if he hadn ’ t turned around no use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel of recorded history flashes past struck dumb unable to utter an intelligent comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train only love stays on the brain and something these people these other ones call life singing accurately so that the notes mount straight up out of the well of dim noon and rival the tiny sparkling yellow flowers growing around the brink of the quarry encapsulates the different weights of the things but it isn ’ t enough to just go on singing orpheus realized this and didn ’ t mind so much about his reward being in heaven after the bacchantes had torn him apart driven half out of their minds by his music what it was doing to them some say it was for his treatment of eurydice but probably the music had more to do with it and the way music passes emblematic of life and how you can not isolate a note of it and say it is good or bad you must wait till it ’ s over “ the end crowns all ” meaning also that the “ tableau ” is wrong for although memories of a season for example melt into a single snapshot one can not guard treasure that stalled moment it too is flowing fleeting it is a picture of flowing scenery though living mortal over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt harsh strokes and to ask more than this is to become the tossing reeds of that slow powerful stream the trailing grasses playfully tugged at but to participate in the action no more than this then in the lowering gentian sky electric twitches are faintly apparent first then burst forth into a shower of fixed cream-colored flares the horses have each seen a share of the truth though each thinks “ i ’ m a maverick nothing of this is happening to me though i can understand the language of birds and the itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me their jousting ends in music much as trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm and is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees now day after day. ” but how late to be regretting all this even bearing in mind that regrets are always late too late to which orpheus a bluish cloud with white contours replies that these are of course not regrets at all merely a careful scholarly setting down of unquestioned facts a record of pebbles along the way and no matter how all this disappeared or got where it was going it is no longer material for a poem its subject matters too much and not enough standing there helplessly while the poem streaked by its tail afire a bad comet screaming hate and disaster but so turned inward that the meaning good or other can never become known the singer thinks constructively builds up his chant in progressive stages like a skyscraper but at the last minute turns away the song is engulfed in an instant in blackness which must in turn flood the whole continent with blackness for it can not see the singer must then pass out of sight not even relieved of the evil burthen of the words stellification is for the few and comes about much later when all record of these people and their lives has disappeared into libraries onto microfilm a few are still interested in them “ but what about so-and-so ” is still asked on occasion but they lie frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name in whose tale are hidden syllables of what happened so long before that in some small town one indifferent summer
there may be chaos still around the world this little world that in my thinking lies for mine own bosom is the paradise where all my life ’ s fair visions are unfurled within my nature ’ s shell i slumber curled unmindful of the changing outer skies where now perchance some new-born eros flies or some old cronos from his throne is hurled i heed them not or if the subtle night haunt me with deities i never saw i soon mine eyelid ’ s drowsy curtain draw to hide their myriad faces from my sight they threat in vain the whirlwind can not awe a happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw

once it smiled a silent dell where the people did not dwell they had gone unto the wars trusting to the mild-eyed stars nightly from their azure towers to keep watch above the flowers in the midst of which all day the red sun-light lazily lay now each visitor shall confess the sad valley ’ s restlessness nothing there is motionless— nothing save the airs that brood over the magic solitude ah by no wind are stirred those trees that palpitate like the chill seas around the misty hebrides ah by no wind those clouds are driven that rustle through the unquiet heaven uneasily from morn till even over the violets there that lie in myriad types of the human eye— over the lilies there that wave and weep above a nameless grave they wave —from out their fragrant tops external dews come down in drops they weep —from off their delicate stems perennial tears descend in gems
part i i in a far country and a distant age ere sprites and fays had bade farewell to earth a boy was born of humble parentage the stars that shone upon his lonely birth did seem to promise sovereignty and fame— yet no tradition hath preserved his name ii ’ t is said that on the night when he was born a beauteous shape swept slowly through the room its eyes broke on the infant like a morn and his cheek brightened like a rose in bloom but as it passed away there followed after a sigh of pain and sounds of elvish laughter iii and so his parents deemed him to be blest beyond the lot of mortals they were poor as the most timid bird that stored its nest with the stray gleanings at their cottage-door yet they contrived to rear their little dove and he repaid them with the tenderest love iv the child was very beautiful in sooth and as he waxed in years grew lovelier still on his fair brow the aureole of truth beamed and the purest maidens with a thrill looked in his eyes and from their heaven of blue saw thoughts like sinless angels peering through v need there was none of censure or of praise to mould him to the kind parental hand yet there was ever something in his ways which those about him could not understand a self-withdrawn and independent bliss beside the father ’ s love the mother ’ s kiss vi for oft when he believed himself alone they caught brief snatches of mysterious rhymes which he would murmur in an undertone like a pleased bee ’ s in summer and at times a strange far look would come into his eyes as if he saw a vision in the skies vii and he upon a simple leaf would pore as if its very texture unto him had some deep meaning sometimes by the door from noon until a summer-day grew dim he lay and watched the clouds and to his thought night with her stars but fitful slumbers brought viii in the long hours of twilight when the breeze talked in low tones along the woodland rills or the loud north its stormy minstrelsies blent with wild noises from the distant hills the boy—his rosy hand against his ear curved like a sea-shell—hushed as some rapt seer ix followed the sounds and ever and again as the wind came and went in storm or play he seemed to hearken as to some far strain of mingled voices calling him away and they who watched him held their breath to trace the still and fixed attention in his face x once on a cold and loud-voiced winter night the three were seated by their cottage-fire— the mother watching by its flickering light the wakeful urchin and the dozing sire there was a brief quick motion like a bird ’ s and the boy ’ s thought thus rippled into words xi “ o mother thou hast taught me many things but none i think more beautiful than speech— a nobler power than even those broad wings i used to pray for when i longed to reach that distant peak which on our vale looks down and wears the star of evening for a crown xii “ but mother while our human words are rife to us with meaning other sounds there be which seem and are the language of a life around yet unlike ours winds talk the sea murmurs articulately and the sky listens and answers though inaudibly xiii “ by stream and spring in glades and woodlands lone beside our very cot i ’ ve gathered flowers inscribed with signs and characters unknown but the frail scrolls still baffle all my powers what is this language and where is the key that opes its weird and wondrous mystery xiv “ the forests know it and the mountains know and it is written in the sunset ’ s dyes a revelation to the world below is daily going on before our eyes and but for sinful thoughts i do not doubt that we could spell the thrilling secret out xv “ o mother somewhere on this lovely earth i lived and understood that mystic tongue but for some reason to my second birth only the dullest memories have clung like that fair tree that even while blossoming keeps the dead berries of a former spring xvi “ who shall put life in these —my nightly dreams some teacher of supernal powers foretell a fair and stately shape appears which seems bright with all truth and once in a dark dell within the forest unto me there came a voice that must be hers which called my name. ” xvii puzzled and frightened wondering more and more the mother heard but did not comprehend “ so early dallying with forbidden lore oh what will chance and wherein will it end my child my child ” she caught him to her breast “ oh let me kiss these wildering thoughts to rest xviii “ they can not come from god who freely gives all that we need to have or ought to know beware my son some evil influence strives to grieve thy parents and to work thee woe alas the vision i misunderstood it could not be an angel fair and good. ” xix and then in low and tremulous tones she told the story of his birth-night the boy ’ s eyes as the wild tale went on were bright and bold with a weird look that did not seem surprise “ perhaps ” he said “ this lady and her elves will one day come and take me to themselves. ” xx “ and would ’ st thou leave us ” “ dearest mother no hush i will check these thoughts that give thee pain or if they flow as they perchance must flow at least i will not utter them again hark didst thou hear a voice like many streams mother it is the spirit of my dreams ” xxi thenceforth whatever impulse stirred below in the deep heart beneath that childish breast those lips were sealed and though the eye would glow yet the brow wore an air of perfect rest cheerful content with calm though strong control he shut the temple-portals of his soul xxii and when too restlessly the mighty throng of fancies woke within his teeming mind all silently they formed in glorious song and floated off unheard and undivined perchance not lost—with many a voiceless prayer they reached the sky and found some record there xxiii softly and swiftly sped the quiet days the thoughtful boy has blossomed into youth and still no maiden would have feared his gaze and still his brow was noble with the truth yet though he masks the pain with pious art there burns a restless fever in his heart xxiv a childish dream is now a deathless need which drives him to far hills and distant wilds the solemn faith and fervor of his creed bold as a martyr ’ s simple as a child ’ s the eagle knew him as she knew the blast and the deer did not flee him as he passed xxv but gentle even in his wildest mood always and most he loved the bluest weather and in some soft and sunny solitude couched like a milder sunshine on the heather he communed with the winds and with the birds as if they might have answered him in words xxvi deep buried in the forest was a nook remote and quiet as its quiet skies he knew it sought it loved it as a book full of his own sweet thoughts and memories dark oaks and fluted chestnuts gathering round pillared and greenly domed a sloping mound xxvii whereof—white purple azure golden red confused like hues of sunset—the wild flowers wove a rich dais through crosslights overhead glanced the clear sunshine fell the fruitful showers and here the shyest bird would fold her wings here fled the fairest and the gentlest things xxviii thither one night of mist and moonlight came the youth with nothing deeper in his thoughts than to behold beneath the silver flame new aspects of his fair and favorite spot a single ray attained the ground and shed just light enough to guide the wanderer ’ s tread xxix and high and hushed arose the stately trees yet shut within themselves like dungeons where lay fettered all the secrets of the breeze silent but not as slumbering all things there wore to the youth ’ s aroused imagination an air of deep and solemn expectation xxx “ hath heaven ” the youth exclaimed “ a sweeter spot or earth another like it —yet even here the old mystery dwells and though i read it not here most i hope—it is or seems so near so many hints come to me but alas i can not grasp the shadows as they pass xxxi “ here from the very turf beneath me i catch but just catch i know not what faint sound and darkly guess that from yon silent sky float starry emanations to the ground these ears are deaf these human eyes are blind i want a purer heart a subtler mind xxxii “ sometimes—could it be fancy —i have felt the presence of a spirit who might speak as down in lowly reverence i knelt its very breath has kissed my burning cheek but i in vain have hushed my own to hear a wing or whisper stir the silent air ” xxxiii is not the breeze articulate hark oh hark a distant murmur like a voice of floods and onward sweeping slowly through the dark bursts like a call the night-wind from the woods low bow the flowers the trees fling loose their dreams and through the waving roof a fresher moonlight streams xxxiv “ mortal ” —the word crept slowly round the place as if that wind had breathed it from no star streams that soft lustre on the dreamer ’ s face again a hushing calm while faint and far the breeze goes calling onward through the night dear god what vision chains that wide-strained sight xxxv over the grass and flowers and up the slope glides a white cloud of mist self-moved and slow that pausing at the hillock ’ s moonlit cope swayed like a flame of silver from below the breathless youth with beating heart beholds a mystic motion in its argent folds xxxvi yet his young soul is bold and hope grows warm as flashing through that cloud of shadowy crape with sweep of robes and then a gleaming arm slowly developing at last took shape a face and form unutterably bright that cast a golden glamour on the night xxxvii but for the glory round it it would seem almost a mortal maiden and the boy unto whom love was yet an innocent dream shivered and crimsoned with an unknown joy as to the young spring bounds the passionate south he could have clasped and kissed her mouth to mouth xxxviii yet something checked that was and was not dread till in a low sweet voice the maiden spake she was the fairy of his dreams she said and loved him simply for his human sake and that in heaven wherefrom she took her birth they called her poesy the angel of the earth xxxix “ and ever since that immemorial hour when the glad morning-stars together sung my task hath been beneath a mightier power to keep the world forever fresh and young i give it not its fruitage and its green but clothe it with a glory all unseen xl “ i sow the germ which buds in human art and with my sister science i explore with light the dark recesses of the heart and nerve the will and teach the wish to soar i touch with grace the body ’ s meanest clay while noble souls are nobler for my sway xli “ before my power the kings of earth have bowed i am the voice of freedom and the sword leaps from its scabbard when i call aloud wherever life in sacrifice is poured wherever martyrs die or patriots bleed i weave the chaplet and award the meed xlii “ where passion stoops or strays is cold or dead i lift from error or to action thrill or if it rage too madly in its bed the tempest hushes at my ‘ peace be still ’ i know how far its tides should sink or swell and they obey my sceptre and my spell xliii “ all lovely things and gentle—the sweet laugh of children girlhood ’ s kiss and friendship ’ s clasp the boy that sporteth with the old man ’ s staff the baby and the breast its fingers grasp— all that exalts the grounds of happiness all griefs that hallow and all joys that bless xliv “ to me are sacred at my holy shrine love breathes its latest dreams its earliest hints i turn life ’ s tasteless waters into wine and flush them through and through with purple tints wherever earth is fair and heaven looks down i rear my altars and i wear my crown xlv “ i am the unseen spirit thou hast sought i woke those shadowy questionings that vex thy young mind lost in its own cloud of thought and rouse the soul they trouble and perplex i filled thy days with visions and thy nights blessed with all sweetest sounds and fairy sights xlvi “ not here not in this world may i disclose the mysteries in which this life is hearsed some doubts there be that with some earthly woes by death alone shall wholly be dispersed yet on those very doubts from this low sod thy soul shall pass beyond the stars to god xlvii “ and so to knowledge climbing grade by grade thou shalt attain whatever mortals can and what thou may ’ st discover by my aid thou shalt translate unto thy brother man and men shall bless the power that flings a ray into their night from thy diviner day xlviii “ for from thy lofty height thy words shall fall upon their spirits like bright cataracts that front a sunrise thou shalt hear them call amid their endless waste of arid facts as wearily they plod their way along upon the rhythmic zephyrs of thy song xlix “ all this is in thy reach but much depends upon thyself—thy future i await i give the genius point the proper ends but the true bard is his own only fate into thy soul my soul have i infused take care thy lofty powers be wisely used l “ the poet owes a high and holy debt which if he feel he craves not to be heard for the poor boon of praise or place nor yet does the mere joy of song as with the bird of many voices prompt the choral lay that cheers that gentle pilgrim on his way li “ nor may he always sweep the passionate lyre which is his heart only for such relief as an impatient spirit may desire lest from the grave which hides a private grief the spells of song call up some pallid wraith to blast or ban a mortal hope or faith lii “ yet over his deep soul with all its crowd of varying hopes and fears he still must brood as from its azure height a tranquil cloud watches its own bright changes in the flood self-reading not self-loving—they are twain— and sounding while he mourns the depths of pain liii “ thus shall his songs attain the common breast dyed in his own life ’ s blood the sign and seal even as the thorns which are the martyr ’ s crest that do attest his office and appeal unto the universal human heart in sanction of his mission and his art liv “ much yet remains unsaid—pure must he be oh blessed are the pure for they shall hear where others hear not see where others see with a dazed vision who have drawn most near my shrine have ever brought a spirit cased and mailed in a body clean and chaste lv “ the poet to the whole wide world belongs even as the teacher is the child ’ s—i said no selfish aim should ever mar his songs but self wears many guises men may wed self in another and the soul may be self to its centre all unconsciously lvi “ and therefore must the poet watch lest he in the dark struggle of this life should take stains which he might not notice he must flee falsehood however winsome and forsake all for the truth assured that truth alone is beauty and can make him all my own lvii “ and he must be as armed warrior strong and he must be as gentle as a girl and he must front and sometimes suffer wrong with brow unbent and lip untaught to curl for wrath and scorn and pride however just fill the clear spirit ’ s eyes with earthly dust. ” the story came to me—it recks not whence— in fragments oh if i could tell it all if human speech indeed could tell it all ’ t were not a whit less wondrous than if i should find untouched in leaf and stem and bright as when it bloomed three thousand years ago on some idalian slope a perfect rose alas a leaf or two and they perchance scarce worth the hiving one or two dead leaves are the sole harvest of a summer ’ s toil there was a moment ne ’ er to be recalled when to the poet ’ s hope within my heart they wore a tint like life ’ s but in my hand i know not why they withered i have heard somewhere of some dead monarch from the tomb where he had slept a century and more brought forth that when the coffin was laid bare albeit the body in its mouldering robes was fleshless yet one feature still remained perfect or perfect seemed at least the eyes gleamed for a second on the startled crowd and then went out in ashes even thus the story when i drew it from the grave where it had lain so long did seem i thought not wholly lifeless but even while i gazed to fix its features on my heart and called the world to wonder with me lo it proved i looked upon a corpse what further fell in that lone forest nook how much was taught how much was only hinted what the youth promised if promise were required to do or strive for what the gifts he bore away— or added powers or blessings—how at last the vision ended and he sought his home how lived there and how long and when he passed into the busy world to seek his fate i know not and if any ever knew the tale hath perished from the earth for here the slender thread on which my song is strung breaks off and many after-years of life are lost to sight the life to reappear only toward its close—as of a dream we catch the end and opening but forget that which had joined them in the dreaming brain or as a mountain with a belt of mist that shows his base and far above a peak with a blue plume of pines but turn the page and read the only hints that yet remain part ii i it is not winter yet but that sweet time in autumn when the first cool days are past a week ago the leaves were hoar with rime and some have dropped before the north wind ’ s blast but the mild hours are back and at mid-noon the day hath all the genial warmth of june ii what slender form lies stretched along the mound can it be his the wanderer ’ s with that brow gray in its prime those eyes that wander round listlessly with a jaded glance that now seems to see nothing where it rests and then pores on each trivial object in its ken iii see how a gentle maid ’ s wan fingers clasp the last fond love-notes of some faithless hand thus with a transient interest his weak grasp holds a few leaves as when of old he scanned the meaning in their gold and crimson streaks but the sweet dream has vanished hush he speaks iv “ once more once more after long pain and toil and yet not long if i should count by years i breathe my native air and tread the soil i trod in childhood if i shed no tears no happy tears ’ t is that their fount is dry and joy that can not weep must sigh must sigh v “ these leaves my boyish books in days of yore when as the weeks sped by i seemed to stand ever upon the brink of some wild lore these leaves shall make my bed and—for the hand of god is on me chilling brain and breath— i shall not ask a softer couch in death vi “ here was it that i saw or dreamed i saw i know not which that shape of love and light spirit of song have i not owned thy law have i not taught or striven to teach the right and kept my heart as clean my life as sweet as mortals may when mortals mortals meet vii “ thou know ’ st how i went forth my youthful breast on fire with thee amid the paths of men once in my wanderings my lone footsteps pressed a mountain forest in a sombre glen down which its thunderous boom a cataract flung a little bird unheeded built and sung viii “ so fell my voice amid the whirl and rush of human passions if unto my art sorrow hath sometimes owed a gentler gush i know it not if any poet-heart hath kindled at my songs its light divine i know it not no ray came back to mine ix “ alone in crowds once more i sought to make of senseless things my friends the clouds that burn above the sunset and the flowers that shake their odors in the wind—these would not turn their faces from me far from cities i forgot the scornful world that passed me by x “ yet even the world ’ s cold slights i might have borne nor fled though sorrowing but i shrank at last when one sweet face too sweet i thought for scorn looked scornfully upon me then i passed from all that youth had dreamed or manhood planned into the self that none would understand xi “ she was—i never wronged her womanhood by crowning it with praises not her own— she was all earth ’ s and earth ’ s too in that mood when she brings forth her fairest i atone now in this fading brow and failing frame that such a soul such soul as mine could tame xii “ clay to its kindred clay i loved in sooth too deeply and too purely to be blest with something more of lust and less of truth she would have sunk all blushes on my breast and—but i must not blame her—in my ear death whispers and the end thank god draws near ” xiii hist on the perfect silence of the place comes and dies off a sound like far-off rain with voices mingled on the poet ’ s face a shadow where no shadow should have lain falls the next moment nothing meets his sight yet something moves betwixt him and the light xiv and a voice murmurs “ wonder not but hear me to behold again thou need ’ st not seek yet by the dim-felt influence on the air and by the mystic shadow on thy cheek know though thou may ’ st not touch with fleshly hands the genius of thy life beside thee stands xv “ unto no fault o weary-hearted one unto no fault of man ’ s thou ow ’ st thy fate all human hearts that beat this earth upon all human thoughts and human passions wait upon the genuine bard to him belong and help in their own way the poet ’ s song xvi “ how blame the world for the world hast thou wrought or wast thou but as one who aims to fling the weight of some unutterable thought down like a burden what from questioning too subtly thy own spirit and to speech but half subduing themes beyond the reach xvii “ of mortal reason what from living much in that dark world of shadows where the soul wanders bewildered striving still to clutch yet never clutching once a shadowy goal which always flies and while it flies seems near thy songs were riddles hard to mortal ear xviii “ this was the hidden selfishness that marred thy teachings ever this the false key-note that on such souls as might have loved thee jarred like an unearthly language thou did ’ st float on a strange water those who stood on land gazed but they could not leave their beaten strand xix “ your elements were different and apart— the world ’ s and thine—and even in those intense and watchful broodings o ’ er thy inmost heart it was thy own peculiar difference that thou did ’ st seek nor did ’ st thou care to find aught that would bring thee nearer to thy kind xx “ not thus the poet who in blood and brain would represent his race and speak for all weaves the bright woof of that impassioned strain which drapes as if for some high festival of pure delights—whence few of human birth may rightly be shut out—the common earth xxi “ as the same law that moulds a planet rounds a drop of dew so the great poet spheres worlds in himself no selfish limit bounds a sympathy that folds all characters all ranks all passions and all life almost in its wide circle like some noble host xxii “ he spreads the riches of his soul and bids partake who will age has its saws of truth and love is for the maiden ’ s drooping lids and words of passion for the earnest youth wisdom for all and when it seeks relief tears and their solace for the heart of grief xxiii “ nor less on him than thee the mysteries within him and about him ever weigh— the meanings in the stars and in the breeze all the weird wonders of the common day truths that the merest point removes from reach and thoughts that pause upon the brink of speech xxiv “ but on the surface of his song these lie as shadows not as darkness and alway even though it breathe the secrets of the sky there is a human purpose in the lay as some tall fir that whispers to the stars shields at its base a cotter ’ s lattice-bars xxv “ even such my poet for thou still art mine thou might ’ st have been and now have calmly died a priest and not a victim at the shrine alas yet was it all thy fault i chide perchance myself within thee and the fate to which thy power was solely consecrate xxvi “ thy life hath not been wholly without use albeit that use is partly hidden now in thy unmingled scorn of any truce with this world ’ s specious falsehoods often thou hast uttered through some all unworldly song truths that for man might else have slumbered long xxvii “ and these not always vainly on the crowd have fallen some are cherished now and some in mystic phrases wrapped as in a shroud wait the diviner who as yet is dumb upon the breast of god—the gate of birth closed on a dreamless ignorance of earth xxviii “ and therefore though thy name shall pass away even as a cloud that hath wept all its showers yet as that cloud shall live again one day in the glad grass and in the happy flowers so in thy thoughts though clothed in sweeter rhymes thy life shall bear its flowers in future times ”

all their songs are of one hour before dawn when the birds begin i sing another in helpless midday at the hour even sparrows have no heart to shrill comes news suddenly the unimaginable needs imagination and finds none violet ocean only nothing smoke of thyme and of cedar ornate birds nothing even a god who came here hearing a sweet voice would find only old fires now brittle in the blackened trees she was mast and sail she was a stillness pregnant with motion adorable to me as all my life i have hidden a cruel secret ocean in sinews and in sleep and cowardice she forgave me once she wept for me our child died then and she is with him

the clew paying out through his fingers a deftness that would bring him back to her its softness the softness of skin as if drawn from herself directly the faint labial smell guiding him up and out as some dampness on the air might lead a stone-blind man to the light asterios dead for sure his crumpled horn his muzzle thick with blood so at delos they stopped theseus and the young athenians and stepped up to the `` altar of horns '' to dance a puzzle- dance its moves unreadable except to those who 'd walked the blank meanders of the labyrinth and this was midday a fierce sun the blaze of their nakedness the glitter of repetitions a dazzle rising off the sea the scents of pine and hyacinth well things change new passions new threats new fears new consequences too nowadays we do n't think much about theseus the minotaur ariadne on the beach at naxos staring out at the coming years but people still dance that dance just common folk those criss-cross steps that no one had to teach at weddings and wakes in bars or parks as if hope and heart could meet as if they might even now somehow dance themselves out of the dark

phoebus was gone all gone his journey over his sister was riding high nothing bridled her her light was falling shining into woods and rivers wild animals opened their jaws wide stirred to prey but in the human world all was sleep pause relaxation torpor one night in an april which had just gone by the likeness of my love stood beside me suddenly he called my name so quietly he touched me gently his voice was drowning in tears it failed completely his sighs overwhelmed him finally he could not speak clearly i shuddered at his touch i felt the fear of it i trembled as if i knew the true terror of it i opened my arms wide and pressed him against my body then i froze i was ice all ice my blood drained into it he had fled here was my embrace—and there was nothing in it fully awake now i cried out loudly '' where are you fleeing to why are you rushing away wait wait for me if you want i can enter there because the truth is i want to live with you forever '' but soon i regretted it—that i had spoken out this way and all the time the windows of the terrace had been wide open the light of the moon poured down its beauty its radiance and i grieved and grieved i grieved for so long the tears flowed down my cheeks tributaries of tears it was a whole day before i could stop weeping
from `` metamorphoses '' book ii 846-875 majesty is incompatible truly with love they cohabit nowhere together the father and chief of the gods whose right hand is armed with the triple-forked lightning who shakes the whole world with a nod laid dignity down with his sceptre adopting the guise of a bull that mixed with the cattle and lowed as he ambled around the fresh fields a beautiful animal colored like snow that no footprint has trodden and which no watery south wind has melted his muscular neck bulged dewlaps hung down from his chin his curved horns you might think had been hand carved perfect more purely translucent than pearl his unthreatening brow and far from formidable eyes made his face appear tranquil agenor 's daughter was truly amazed that this beautiful bull did not seem to manifest any hostility though he was gentle she trembled at first to touch him but soon she approached him adorning his muzzle with flowers then he rejoiced as a lover and while he looked forward to hoped for pleasures he slobbered all over her hands and could hardly postpone the joys that remained so he frolicked and bounded about on the green grass laying his snowy-white flanks on the yellowish sands as her fear was little by little diminished he offered his chest for her virgin hand to caress and his horns to be decked with fresh flowers the royal maiden not knowing on whom she was sitting was even so bold as also to climb on the back of the bull as the god very slowly inched from the shore and the dry land he planted his spurious footprints deep in the shallows thus swimming out farther he carried his prey off into the midst of the sea almost fainting with terror she glanced back as she was carried away at the shore left behind as she gripped one horn in her right hand while clutching the back of the beast with the other meanwhile her fluttering draperies billowed behind on the sea breeze
after dark the bar full of women part of me loves—the part that stood naked outside the window of miss geneva recent divorcée who owned a gun o miss geneva where are you now—orpheus says she did not perish she was not turned to ash in the brutal light she found a good job she made good money she had her own insurance and a house she was a decent wife i know descent lives in the word decent the bar noise makes a kind of silence when orpheus hands me his sunglasses i see how fire changes everything in the mind i am behind a woman whose skirt is hiked above her hips as bound as touch permits saying do n't forget me when i become the liquid out of which names are born salt-milk milk-sweet and animal-made i want to be a human above the body uprooted and right a fold of pleas released but i am a black wound what 's left of the deed
the deep male growl of the sea-lashed headland —sophocles philoctetes august long ago the summer lemnian not like the deeds of those who killed their men the self a glowing bead like hephaestus falling daylong out of heaven in the old story the island 's interior a forge a glory hole the odor of wild thyme borne offshore steadily the aegean sea purple wine-dark without epithet and as i walked on the beach my mother not long dead the perfect crystal of my self-regard so lately flawed and landscape made to echo my own low cry in the island 's empty places i found a pure white bone that wind and salt had scoured of every grief and all self-pity and so i came to the love of others
o fluent one o muscle full of hydrogen o stuff of grief whom the greeks accuse of spoiling souls whose destiny is downward whose reflecting 's up—i think i must have come from you just one more cup
sprawling like some small group of picnickers they 're propped among the shadows of the trees though one seems drunk spread-eagled nothing stirs except the flies that clog their cavities a red cleft rules the parting of that head you stretch a little and slide out of bed acres of debris are in sodden flood about the ruined village which concedes in blackened matchwood to the tide of mud its smoking households rising from the weeds arms reach up stiffly as for an embrace out of the mirror you observe your face while sunlight offers all that you desire the aztecs to appease your counterparts would hook still-living bodies from the fire hack out and hold aloft the pulsing hearts drenching the steps with blood so they might give those idle brutes each day a day to live you have today stark-eyed and hollow-faced her rigid ribcage almost bursting through the skin a girl sits in a land laid waste and stares out blankly so then it is you— the thought had not occurred to you before— it 's you huitzilopochtli god of war
do n't be misled that sea-song you hear when the shell 's at your ear it 's all in your head that primordial tide— the slurp and salt-slosh of the brain 's briny wash— is on the inside truth be told the whole place everything that the eye can take in to the sky and beyond into space lives inside of your skull when you set your sad head down on procrustes bed you lay down the whole universe you recline on the pillow the cosmos grows dim the soft ghost in the squishy machine which the world is retires someday it will expire then all will go silent and dark for the moment however the black- ness is just temporary the planet you carry will shortly swing back from the far nether regions and life will continue— but only within you which raises a question that comes up again and again as to why god would make ear and eye to face outward not in
on the day we moved in the pings bumps and snaps were scary it 's true but probably normal a house accepting new patterns of weight with protest the way no conviction goes gently we laughed a little and called it `` our spirit '' later that night when the power conked out and the kids were crying the ghost got a name '' daniel '' and a history of whispered exploits all of them harmless like nursery rhymes or like the little fibs we tell ourselves to explain why this or that has led to suffering pretty soon we were using him for everything when the christmas tree fell it was `` daniel '' when my wife lost her ring it was `` daniel '' when the kids forgot to feed the goldfish and it turned up dead its eyes silvered over like water shadowed under sheets of ice well that became daniel too which was curious and pauses me now as i make the long walk down the hall to the bathroom in darkness and hear in soft concert the sound of my footfalls answered at once by my children 's voices still calling to daniel behind their door
do n't bring haw into the house at night or in any month with a red fruit in season or when starlings bank against the light do n't bring haw in do n't give me reason to think you have hidden haw about you tucked in secret may its thorn thwart you plucked in blossom powdered by your thumb i will smell it for the hum of haw is long its hold is low and lilting if you bring haw in i will know you want me gone to the fairies and their jilting i will know you want me buried in the deep green field where god knows what is rotting
my uncle fletcher our county seer bestowed his gifts on my no-good cousin jeff who had a feeling about nearly everything `` that guy of hers '' `` those fucking queers '' he 'd say giving me the eye which was the same eye that could gaze upon a yellow froth of newborns and know the cockerels from the pullets
who would believe them winged who would believe they could be beautiful who would believe they could fall so in love with mortals that they would attach themselves as scars attach and ride the skin sometimes we hear them in our dreams rattling their skulls clicking their bony fingers envying our crackling hair our spice filled flesh they have heard me beseeching as i whispered into my own cupped hands enough not me again enough but who can distinguish one human voice amid such choruses of desire
for marybelle her daughter wrote back to say my friend had died my friend to whom i wrote a letter maybe twice a year from time to time i 'd pictured her amid strange foliage and in a mongol yurt for she was fond of travel why not a flock of something darkening the sky so we would know ah so-and-so is gone for a woman from the city this might perhaps be pigeons blacking out the sun or else a human messenger as once when she was fabric shopping bolt of green silk furled across her body garbo passed and nodded at macy 's years ago when i was not a creature in her world of course she bought the cloth but never sewed the dress `` a massive stroke and i take comfort in the fact she felt no pain '' logic says we should make omens of our garbos and our birds but which one bears the message which one just the mess from the kayak i 've seen pigeons nesting underneath the pier a dim ammoniated stink where one flew into my face i read this as a sign that rancid smash of feathers but could n't fathom what it meant trapped in the lag-time of an oracle 's translation foolish mind wanting to obliterate the lag and why— let memory wait to catch up to its sorrow
somewhere in eden after all this time does there still stand abandoned like a ruined city gates sealed with grisly nails the luckless garden is sultry day still followed there by sultry dusk sultry night where on the branches sallow and purple the fruit hangs rotting is there still underground spreading like lace among the rocks a network of unexploited lodes onyx and gold through the lush greenery their wash echoing afar do there still flow the four glassy streams of which no mortal drinks somewhere in eden after all this time does there still stand like a city in ruins forsaken doomed to slow decay the failed garden
she awoke to find her fishtail clean gone but in the bed with her were two long cold thingammies you 'd have thought they were tangles of kelp or collops of ham `` they 're no doubt taking the piss it being new year 's eve half the staff legless with drink and the other half playing pranks still this is taking it a bit far '' and with that she hurled the two thingammies out of the room but here 's the thing she still does n't get— why she tumbled out after them arse-over-tip ... how she was connected to those two thingammies and how they were connected to her it was the sister who gave her the wink and let her know what was what `` you have one leg attached to you there and another one underneath that one leg two legs ... a-one and a-two ... now you have to learn what they can do '' in the long months that followed i wonder if her heart fell the way her arches fell her instep arches
a night address the world is wasted on you show us one clear time beyond childhood or the bottle you spent your whole self—hoarding no blood-bank back-up some future aim to fuel—or let yourself look foolish in reckless style on barstool backstreet or dancefloor without a dim image of your hamming hobbling you the whole while voyeur to your own couplings you never did come with them did you even when you did you said hell is details when hell was just the cave the concave- mirrored skull you dwelt inside your left hand polishing while the other shook to clinch a deal— provide provide sure in the end like any soul you were endless and yets—brave deft with phrases kind— three cheers for you too closed to want what others love you vetoed life— were there other worlds to crave
a lavender fog breeds with our children our girls are dying on the roadsides their wombs pried open by the scramble that grows inside save us from the lavender fog — it ’ s the ghosts of your dead people who have never bothered our village before their shapes convulse in our water sources when we get close enough to hear their ghostly voices they say yum-yum pleadingly and shout out better better as in i ’ ll get better some of our children have taken these as lyrics your ghosts are corrupting the youth stop using us as musical instruments this is a great taboo you have violated go back to making tubes of wood vibrate and scraping your goat gut
act 2 scene 2 clindor a young picaresque hero has been living by his wits in paris but has now drifted to bordeaux to become the valet of a braggart bravo named matamore he is chiefly employed as a go-between carrying matamore 's amorous messages to the beautiful isabelle—who only suffers the master because she is in love with the messenger clindor sir why so restless is there any need with all your fame for one more glorious deed have you not slain enough bold foes by now and must you have fresh laurels for your brow matamore it 's true i 'm restless and i ca n't decide which of two foes should first be nullified— the mogul emperor or the persian sophy clindor ah let them live a while sir neither trophy would add a great deal to your fame and standing and where 's the army that you 'd be commanding matamore army ah villain coward do you doubt that with this arm alone i 'd wipe them out the mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield and drives divisions from the battlefield my wrath against these rulers needs engage only a piddling portion of my rage with one commandment given to the fates i oust the strongest monarchs from their states thunder 's my cannon my troops the destinies one blow lays low a thousand enemies one breath and all their hopes go up in smoke yet you dare speak of armies what a joke no longer shall a second mars employ you with but a glance you rogue i shall destroy you ... and yet the thought of her whom i adore softens me now and i 'm enraged no more that little archer whom every god obeys forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays observe how my ferocity which hates and hacks and slaughters gently dissipates when i recall my lady and my face is changed by thoughts of beauty love and grace clindor oh sir you have a hundred selves or more you 're as handsome now as you were grim before i ca n't imagine any lady who could stubbornly refuse her heart to you matamore whatever i may have said feel no alarm sometimes i terrify sometimes i charm depending on my humor i inspire men with anxiety women with desire before i had the power to suppress my beauty women gave me much distress when i appeared they swooned in quantity and thousands died each day for love of me with every princess i had many a tryst and every queen came begging to be kissed the ethiopian and the japanese murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas two sultanesses could not but adore me two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me which strained my friendship with the turkish nation clindor their anger could but gild your reputation matamore still all that was more trouble than it was worth it balked my plans for conquering the earth what 's more i tired of it and to deter such nuisances sent word to jupiter that if he could not put a stop to these fond women and their importunities i 'd rise up in a rage and end his reign as ruler of the gods and would obtain for mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder needless to say the coward knuckled under he did as i desired and now you see i 'm handsome only when i choose to be clindor what love notes you 'd receive were that not so matamore do n't bring me any ... unless from her you know what does she say of me clindor today she said that you inspire all hearts with love and dread and that if what you promise her comes true she 'll feel herself a goddess thanks to you matamore back in the times i 've just been speaking of goddesses also pestered me for love and i shall tell you of a strange event which caused confusion without precedent and threw all nature into disarray the sun was powerless to rise one day because that bright much-worshipped deity could not find where the dawn his guide might be he sought her everywhere in cephalus bower in old tithonus bed in memnon 's tower but since aurora nowhere was in sight the day till noontide was as black as night clindor where was the goddess during these alarms matamore in my bedchamber offering me her charms but she gained nothing by such shameless actions my heart was blind to all her bright attractions and all she got by showing off her beauty was a firm command to go and do her duty clindor that curious story sir i now recall i was in mexico where i heard it all they said that persia vexed by the insult to their famous sun god had it in for you matamore i heard as much and would have made them pay but was in transylvania that day where their ambassador hastened to appease my wrath with presents and apologies clindor your brave heart showed them clemency how fine matamore just look my friend upon this face of mine there every human virtue can be found of all the foes i 've stamped into the ground whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside there was not one who did not fall through pride but those who humbly honored my perfection have kept their power through a wise subjection the modest kings of europe are all my vassals i do not sack their towns or wreck their castles i let them reign but it 's another story in africa where i scorched the territory of certain kings who lacked humility and left great deserts there for all to see those endless sands beneath those skies of fire are a great monument to my righteous ire clindor let us revert to love your lady 's here matamore my cursèd rival 's at her side i fear clindor where are you going matamore he is n't brave this dunce and yet he 's vain and could be bold for once perhaps he 'll challenge me from foolish pride merely because he 's at the lady 's side clindor by doing so the fool might come to harm matamore i ca n't be valorous when i 'm full of charm clindor cease to be charming and be terrible sir matamore oh you do n't realize what that would incur i ca n't be terrible by halves you know i 'd slaughter both my mistress and my foe until they part let 's stand aside and wait clindor your prudence like your valor is very great they withdraw to a corner
once in the city of kalamazoo the gods went walking two and two with the friendly phoenix the stars of orion the speaking pony and singing lion for in kalamazoo in a cottage apart lived the girl with the innocent heart thenceforth the city of kalamazoo was the envied intimate chum of the sun he rose from a cave by the principal street the lions sang the dawn-horns blew and the ponies danced on silver feet he hurled his clouds of love around deathless colors of his old heart draped the houses and dyed the ground o shrine of the wide young yankee land incense city of kalamazoo that held in the midnight the priceless sun as a jeweller holds an opal in hand from the awkward city of oshkosh came love the bully no whip shall tame bringing his gang of sinners bold and i was the least of his oshkosh men but none were reticent none were old and we joined the singing phoenix then and shook the lilies of kalamazoo all for one hidden butterfly bulls of glory in cars of war we charged the boulevards proud to die for her ribbon sailing there on high our blood set gutters all aflame where the sun slept without any heat— cold rock till he must rise again she made great poets of wolf-eyed men— the dear queen-bee of kalamazoo with her crystal wings and her honey heart we fought for her favors a year and a day oh the bones of the dead the oshkosh dead that were scattered along her pathway red and then in her harum-scarum way she left with a passing traveller-man— with a singing irishman went to japan why do the lean hyenas glare where the glory of artemis had begun— of atalanta joan of arc cinderella becky thatcher and orphant annie all in one who burned this city of kalamazoo till nothing was left but a ribbon or two— one scorched phoenix that mourned in the dew acres of ashes a junk-man 's cart a torn-up letter a dancing shoe and the bones of the dead the dead who burned this city of kalamazoo— love-town troy-town kalamazoo a harum-scarum innocent heart
i have read somewhere that the birds of fairyland are white as snow.—w b. yeats where all the trees bear golden flowers and all the birds are white where fairy folk in dancing hours burn stars for candlelight where every wind and leaf can talk but no man understand save one whose child-feet chanced to walk green paths of fairyland i followed two swift silver wings i stalked a roving song i startled shining silent things i wandered all day long but when it seemed the shadowy hours whispered of soft-foot night i crept home to sweet common flowers brown birds and candlelight

mother when he lay when thy son lay pierc 'd by the shaft which flies in darkness where was lorn urania when adonais died with veiled eyes 'mid listening echoes in her paradise she sate while one with soft enamour 'd breath rekindled all the fading melodies with which like flowers that mock the corse beneath he had adorn 'd and hid the coming bulk of death iii oh weep for adonais—he is dead wake melancholy mother wake and weep yet wherefore quench within their burning bed thy fiery tears and let thy loud heart keep like his a mute and uncomplaining sleep for he is gone where all things wise and fair descend—oh dream not that the amorous deep will yet restore him to the vital air death feeds on his mute voice and laughs at our despair iv most musical of mourners weep again lament anew urania he died who was the sire of an immortal strain blind old and lonely when his country 's pride the priest the slave and the liberticide trampled and mock 'd with many a loathed rite of lust and blood he went unterrified into the gulf of death but his clear sprite yet reigns o'er earth the third among the sons of light v most musical of mourners weep anew not all to that bright station dar 'd to climb and happier they their happiness who knew whose tapers yet burn through that night of time in which suns perish 'd others more sublime struck by the envious wrath of man or god have sunk extinct in their refulgent prime and some yet live treading the thorny road which leads through toil and hate to fame 's serene abode vi but now thy youngest dearest one has perish 'd the nursling of thy widowhood who grew like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherish 'd and fed with true-love tears instead of dew most musical of mourners weep anew thy extreme hope the loveliest and the last the bloom whose petals nipp 'd before they blew died on the promise of the fruit is waste the broken lily lies—the storm is overpast vii to that high capital where kingly death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay he came and bought with price of purest breath a grave among the eternal.—come away haste while the vault of blue italian day is yet his fitting charnel-roof while still he lies as if in dewy sleep he lay awake him not surely he takes his fill of deep and liquid rest forgetful of all ill. viii he will awake no more oh never more within the twilight chamber spreads apace the shadow of white death and at the door invisible corruption waits to trace his extreme way to her dim dwelling-place the eternal hunger sits but pity and awe soothe her pale rage nor dares she to deface so fair a prey till darkness and the law of change shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw ix oh weep for adonais the quick dreams the passion-winged ministers of thought who were his flocks whom near the living streams of his young spirit he fed and whom he taught the love which was its music wander not— wander no more from kindling brain to brain but droop there whence they sprung and mourn their lot round the cold heart where after their sweet pain they ne'er will gather strength or find a home again x and one with trembling hands clasps his cold head and fans him with her moonlight wings and cries `` our love our hope our sorrow is not dead see on the silken fringe of his faint eyes like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies a tear some dream has loosen 'd from his brain '' lost angel of a ruin 'd paradise she knew not 't was her own as with no stain she faded like a cloud which had outwept its rain xi one from a lucid urn of starry dew wash 'd his light limbs as if embalming them another clipp 'd her profuse locks and threw the wreath upon him like an anadem which frozen tears instead of pearls begem another in her wilful grief would break her bow and winged reeds as if to stem a greater loss with one which was more weak and dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek xii another splendour on his mouth alit that mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit and pass into the panting heart beneath with lightning and with music the damp death quench 'd its caress upon his icy lips and as a dying meteor stains a wreath of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips it flush 'd through his pale limbs and pass 'd to its eclipse xiii and others came desires and adorations winged persuasions and veil 'd destinies splendours and glooms and glimmering incarnations of hopes and fears and twilight phantasies and sorrow with her family of sighs and pleasure blind with tears led by the gleam of her own dying smile instead of eyes came in slow pomp the moving pomp might seem like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream xiv all he had lov 'd and moulded into thought from shape and hue and odour and sweet sound lamented adonais morning sought her eastern watch-tower and her hair unbound wet with the tears which should adorn the ground dimm 'd the aëreal eyes that kindle day afar the melancholy thunder moan 'd pale ocean in unquiet slumber lay and the wild winds flew round sobbing in their dismay xv lost echo sits amid the voiceless mountains and feeds her grief with his remember 'd lay and will no more reply to winds or fountains or amorous birds perch 'd on the young green spray or herdsman 's horn or bell at closing day since she can mimic not his lips more dear than those for whose disdain she pin 'd away into a shadow of all sounds a drear murmur between their songs is all the woodmen hear xvi grief made the young spring wild and she threw down her kindling buds as if she autumn were or they dead leaves since her delight is flown for whom should she have wak 'd the sullen year to phoebus was not hyacinth so dear nor to himself narcissus as to both thou adonais wan they stand and sere amid the faint companions of their youth with dew all turn 'd to tears odour to sighing ruth xvii thy spirit 's sister the lorn nightingale mourns not her mate with such melodious pain not so the eagle who like thee could scale heaven and could nourish in the sun 's domain her mighty youth with morning doth complain soaring and screaming round her empty nest as albion wails for thee the curse of cain light on his head who pierc 'd thy innocent breast and scar 'd the angel soul that was its earthly guest xviii ah woe is me winter is come and gone but grief returns with the revolving year the airs and streams renew their joyous tone the ants the bees the swallows reappear fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead seasons bier the amorous birds now pair in every brake and build their mossy homes in field and brere and the green lizard and the golden snake like unimprison 'd flames out of their trance awake xix through wood and stream and field and hill and ocean a quickening life from the earth 's heart has burst as it has ever done with change and motion from the great morning of the world when first god dawn 'd on chaos in its stream immers 'd the lamps of heaven flash with a softer light all baser things pant with life 's sacred thirst diffuse themselves and spend in love 's delight the beauty and the joy of their renewed might xx the leprous corpse touch 'd by this spirit tender exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath like incarnations of the stars when splendour is chang 'd to fragrance they illumine death and mock the merry worm that wakes beneath nought we know dies shall that alone which knows be as a sword consum 'd before the sheath by sightless lightning —the intense atom glows a moment then is quench 'd in a most cold repose xxi alas that all we lov 'd of him should be but for our grief as if it had not been and grief itself be mortal woe is me whence are we and why are we of what scene the actors or spectators great and mean meet mass 'd in death who lends what life must borrow as long as skies are blue and fields are green evening must usher night night urge the morrow month follow month with woe and year wake year to sorrow xxii he will awake no more oh never more `` wake thou '' cried misery `` childless mother rise out of thy sleep and slake in thy heart 's core a wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs '' and all the dreams that watch 'd urania 's eyes and all the echoes whom their sister 's song had held in holy silence cried `` arise '' swift as a thought by the snake memory stung from her ambrosial rest the fading splendour sprung xxiii she rose like an autumnal night that springs out of the east and follows wild and drear the golden day which on eternal wings even as a ghost abandoning a bier had left the earth a corpse sorrow and fear so struck so rous 'd so rapt urania so sadden 'd round her like an atmosphere of stormy mist so swept her on her way even to the mournful place where adonais lay xxiv out of her secret paradise she sped through camps and cities rough with stone and steel and human hearts which to her aery tread yielding not wounded the invisible palms of her tender feet where'er they fell and barbed tongues and thoughts more sharp than they rent the soft form they never could repel whose sacred blood like the young tears of may pav 'd with eternal flowers that undeserving way xxv in the death-chamber for a moment death sham 'd by the presence of that living might blush 'd to annihilation and the breath revisited those lips and life 's pale light flash 'd through those limbs so late her dear delight `` leave me not wild and drear and comfortless as silent lightning leaves the starless night leave me not '' cried urania her distress rous 'd death death rose and smil 'd and met her vain caress xxvi `` stay yet awhile speak to me once again kiss me so long but as a kiss may live and in my heartless breast and burning brain that word that kiss shall

and can not thence depart xxvii `` o gentle child beautiful as thou wert why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men too soon and with weak hands though mighty heart dare the unpastur 'd dragon in his den defenceless as thou wert oh where was then wisdom the mirror 'd shield or scorn the spear or hadst thou waited the full cycle when thy spirit should have fill 'd its crescent sphere the monsters of life 's waste had fled from thee like deer xxviii `` the herded wolves bold only to pursue the obscene ravens clamorous o'er the dead the vultures to the conqueror 's banner true who feed where desolation first has fed and whose wings rain contagion how they fled when like apollo from his golden bow the pythian of the age one arrow sped and smil 'd the spoilers tempt no second blow they fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low xxix `` the sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn he sets and each ephemeral insect then is gather 'd into death without a dawn and the immortal stars awake again so is it in the world of living men a godlike mind soars forth in its delight making earth bare and veiling heaven and when it sinks the swarms that dimm 'd or shar 'd its light leave to its kindred lamps the spirit 's awful night '' xxx thus ceas 'd she and the mountain shepherds came their garlands sere their magic mantles rent the pilgrim of eternity whose fame over his living head like heaven is bent an early but enduring monument came veiling all the lightnings of his song in sorrow from her wilds ierne sent the sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong and love taught grief to fall like music from his tongue xxxi midst others of less note came one frail form a phantom among men companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm whose thunder is its knell he as i guess had gaz 'd on nature 's naked loveliness actaeon-like and now he fled astray with feeble steps o'er the world 's wilderness and his own thoughts along that rugged way pursu 'd like raging hounds their father and their prey xxxii a pardlike spirit beautiful and swift— a love in desolation mask'd—a power girt round with weakness—it can scarce uplift the weight of the superincumbent hour it is a dying lamp a falling shower a breaking billow even whilst we speak is it not broken on the withering flower the killing sun smiles brightly on a cheek the life can burn in blood even while the heart may break xxxiii his head was bound with pansies overblown and faded violets white and pied and blue and a light spear topp 'd with a cypress cone round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew yet dripping with the forest 's noonday dew vibrated as the ever-beating heart shook the weak hand that grasp 'd it of that crew he came the last neglected and apart a herd-abandon 'd deer struck by the hunter 's dart xxxiv all stood aloof and at his partial moan smil 'd through their tears well knew that gentle band who in another 's fate now wept his own as in the accents of an unknown land he sung new sorrow sad urania scann'd the stranger 's mien and murmur 'd `` who art thou '' he answer 'd not but with a sudden hand made bare his branded and ensanguin 'd brow which was like cain 's or christ's—oh that it should be so xxxv what softer voice is hush 'd over the dead athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown what form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed in mockery of monumental stone the heavy heart heaving without a moan if it be he who gentlest of the wise taught sooth 'd lov 'd honour 'd the departed one let me not vex with inharmonious sighs the silence of that heart 's accepted sacrifice xxxvi our adonais has drunk poison—oh what deaf and viperous murderer could crown life 's early cup with such a draught of woe the nameless worm would now itself disown it felt yet could escape the magic tone whose prelude held all envy hate and wrong but what was howling in one breast alone silent with expectation of the song whose master 's hand is cold whose silver lyre unstrung xxxvii live thou whose infamy is not thy fame live fear no heavier chastisement from me thou noteless blot on a remember 'd name but be thyself and know thyself to be and ever at thy season be thou free to spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow remorse and self-contempt shall cling to thee hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow and like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt—as now xxxviii nor let us weep that our delight is fled far from these carrion kites that scream below he wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead thou canst not soar where he is sitting now dust to the dust but the pure spirit shall flow back to the burning fountain whence it came a portion of the eternal which must glow through time and change unquenchably the same whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame xxxix peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep he hath awaken 'd from the dream of life 't is we who lost in stormy visions keep with phantoms an unprofitable strife and in mad trance strike with our spirit 's knife invulnerable nothings we decay like corpses in a charnel fear and grief convulse us and consume us day by day and cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay xl he has outsoar 'd the shadow of our night envy and calumny and hate and pain and that unrest which men miscall delight can touch him not and torture not again from the contagion of the world 's slow stain he is secure and now can never mourn a heart grown cold a head grown gray in vain nor when the spirit 's self has ceas 'd to burn with sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn xli he lives he wakes—'tis death is dead not he mourn not for adonais thou young dawn turn all thy dew to splendour for from thee the spirit thou lamentest is not gone ye caverns and ye forests cease to moan cease ye faint flowers and fountains and thou air which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown o'er the abandon 'd earth now leave it bare even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair xlii he is made one with nature there is heard his voice in all her music from the moan of thunder to the song of night 's sweet bird he is a presence to be felt and known in darkness and in light from herb and stone spreading itself where'er that power may move which has withdrawn his being to its own which wields the world with never-wearied love sustains it from beneath and kindles it above xliii he is a portion of the loveliness which once he made more lovely he doth bear his part while the one spirit 's plastic stress sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there all new successions to the forms they wear torturing th unwilling dross that checks its flight to its own likeness as each mass may bear and bursting in its beauty and its might from trees and beasts and men into the heaven 's light xliv the splendours of the firmament of time may be eclips 'd but are extinguish 'd not like stars to their appointed height they climb and death is a low mist which can not blot the brightness it may veil when lofty thought lifts a young heart above its mortal lair and love and life contend in it for what shall be its earthly doom the dead live there and move like winds of light on dark and stormy air xlv the inheritors of unfulfill 'd renown rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought far in the unapparent chatterton rose pale his solemn agony had not yet faded from him sidney as he fought and as he fell and as he liv 'd and lov'd sublimely mild a spirit without spot arose and lucan by his death approv 'd oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reprov 'd xlvi and many more whose names on earth are dark but whose transmitted effluence can not die so long as fire outlives the parent spark rose rob 'd in dazzling immortality `` thou art become as one of us '' they cry `` it was for thee yon kingless sphere has long swung blind in unascended majesty silent alone amid a heaven of song assume thy winged throne thou vesper of our throng '' xlvii who mourns for adonais oh come forth fond wretch and know thyself and him aright clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous earth as from a centre dart thy spirit 's light beyond all worlds until its spacious might satiate the void circumference then shrink even to a point within our day and night and keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink when hope has kindled hope and lur 'd thee to the brink xlviii or go to rome which is the sepulchre oh not of him but of our joy 't is nought that ages empires and religions there lie buried in the ravage they have wrought for such as he can lend—they borrow not glory from those who made the world their prey and he is gather 'd to the kings of thought who wag 'd contention with their time 's decay and of the past are all that can not pass away xlix go thou to rome—at once the paradise the grave the city and the wilderness and where its wrecks like shatter 'd mountains rise and flowering weeds and fragrant copses dress the bones of desolation 's nakedness pass till the spirit of the spot shall lead thy footsteps to a slope of green access where like an infant 's smile over the dead a light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread l and gray walls moulder round on which dull time feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime pavilioning the dust of him who plann'd this refuge for his memory doth stand like flame transform 'd to marble and beneath a field is spread on which a newer band have pitch 'd in heaven 's smile their camp of death welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguish 'd breath li here pause these graves are all too young as yet to have outgrown the sorrow which consign'd its charge to each and if the seal is set here on one fountain of a mourning mind break it not thou too surely shalt thou find thine own well full if thou returnest home of tears and gall from the world 's bitter wind seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb what adonais is why fear we to become lii the one remains the many change and pass heaven 's light forever shines earth 's shadows fly life like a dome of many-colour 'd glass stains the white radiance of eternity until death tramples it to fragments.—die if thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek follow where all is fled —rome 's azure sky flowers ruins statues music words are weak the glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak liii why linger why turn back why shrink my heart thy hopes are gone before from all things here they have departed thou shouldst now depart a light is pass 'd from the revolving year and man and woman and what still is dear attracts to crush repels to make thee wither the soft sky smiles the low wind whispers near 't is adonais calls oh hasten thither no more let life divide what death can join together liv that light whose smile kindles the universe that beauty in which all things work and move that benediction which the eclipsing curse of birth can quench not that sustaining love which through the web of being blindly wove by man and beast and earth and air and sea burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of the fire for which all thirst now beams on me consuming the last clouds of cold mortality lv the breath whose might i have invok 'd in song descends on me my spirit 's bark is driven far from the shore far from the trembling throng whose sails were never to the tempest given the massy earth and sphered skies are riven i am borne darkly fearfully afar whilst burning through the inmost veil of heaven the soul of adonais like a star beacons from the abode where the eternal are

town — far from it for one town 's as like another as all are unlike london oh he knows it — and there 's the stratford in him he denies it and there 's the shakespeare in him so god help him i tell him he needs greek but neither god nor greek will help him nothing will help that man you see the fates have given him so much he must have all or perish — or look out of london where he sees too many lords they 're part of half what ails him i suppose there 's nothing fouler down among the demons than what it is he feels when he remembers the dust and sweat and ointment of his calling with his lords looking on and laughing at him king as he is he ca n't be king de facto and that 's as well because he would n't like it he 'd frame a lower rating of men then than he has now and after that would come an abdication or an apoplexy he ca n't be king not even king of stratford — though half the world if not the whole of it may crown him with a crown that fits no king save lord apollo 's homesick emissary not there on avon or on any stream where naiads and their white arms are no more shall he find home again it 's all too bad but there 's a comfort for he 'll have that house — the best you ever saw and he 'll be there anon as you 're an alderman good god he makes me lie awake o'nights and laugh and you have known him from his origin you tell me and a most uncommon urchin he must have been to the few seeing ones — a trifle terrifying i dare say discovering a world with his man 's eyes quite as another lad might see some finches if he looked hard and had an eye for nature but this one had his eyes and their foretelling and he had you to fare with and what else he must have had a father and a mother — in fact i 've heard him say so — and a dog as a boy should i venture and the dog most likely was the only man who knew him a dog for all i know is what he needs as much as anything right here to-day to counsel him about his disillusions old aches and parturitions of what 's coming — a dog of orders an emeritus to wag his tail at him when he comes home and then to put his paws up on his knees and say `` for god 's sake what 's it all about '' i do n't know whether he needs a dog or not — or what he needs i tell him he needs greek i 'll talk of rules and aristotle with him and if his tongue 's at home he 'll say to that i have your word that aristotle knows and you mine that i do n't know aristotle '' he 's all at odds with all the unities and what 's yet worse it does n't seem to matter he treads along through time 's old wilderness as if the tramp of all the centuries had left no roads — and there are none for him he does n't see them even with those eyes — and that 's a pity or i say it is accordingly we have him as we have him — going his way the way that he goes best a pleasant animal with no great noise or nonsense anywhere to set him off — save only divers and inclement devils have made of late his heart their dwelling place a flame half ready to fly out sometimes at some annoyance may be fanned up in him but soon it falls and when it falls goes out he knows how little room there is in there for crude and futile animosities and how much for the joy of being whole and how much for long sorrow and old pain on our side there are some who may be given to grow old wondering what he thinks of us and some above us who are in his eyes above himself — and that 's quite right and english yet here we smile or disappoint the gods who made it so the gods have always eyes to see men scratch and they see one down here who itches manor-bitten to the bone albeit he knows himself — yes yes he knows — the lord of more than england and of more than all the seas of england in all time shall ever wash. d 'ye wonder that i laugh he sees me and he does n't seem to care and why the devil should he i ca n't tell you i 'll meet him out alone of a bright sunday trim rather spruce and quite the gentleman `` what ho my lord '' say i. he does n't hear me wherefore i have to pause and look at him he 's not enormous but one looks at him a little on the round if you insist for now god save the mark he 's growing old he 's five and forty and to hear him talk these days you 'd call him eighty then you 'd add more years to that he 's old enough to be the father of a world and so he is `` ben you 're a scholar what 's the time of day '' says he and there shines out of him again an aged light that has no age or station — the mystery that 's his — a mischievous half-mad serenity that laughs at fame for being won so easy and at friends who laugh at him for what he wants the most and for his dukedom down in warwickshire — by which you see we 're all a little jealous ... poor greene i fear the color of his name was even as that of his ascending soul and he was one where there are many others — some scrivening to the end against their fate their puppets all in ink and all to die there and some with hands that once would shade an eye that scanned euripides and æschylus will reach by this time for a pot-house mop to slush their first and last of royalties poor devils and they all play to his hand for so it was in athens and old rome but that 's not here or there i 've wandered off greene does it or i 'm careful where 's that boy yes he 'll go back to stratford and we 'll miss him dear sir there 'll be no london here without him we 'll all be riding one of these fine days down there to see him — and his wife wo n't like us and then we 'll think of what he never said of women — which if taken all in all with what he did say would buy many horses though nowadays he 's not so much for women '' so few of them '' he says `` are worth the guessing '' but there 's a worm at work when he says that and while he says it one feels in the air a deal of circumambient hocus-pocus they 've had him dancing till his toes were tender and he can feel 'em now come chilly rains there 's no long cry for going into it however and we do n't know much about it but you in stratford like most here in london have more now in the sonnets than you paid for he 's put one there with all her poison on to make a singing fiction of a shadow that 's in his life a fact and always will be but she 's no care of ours though time i fear will have a more reverberant ado about her than about another one who seems to have decoyed him married him and sent him scuttling on his way to london — with much already learned and more to learn and more to follow lord how i see him now pretending maybe trying to be like us whatever he may have meant we never had him he failed us or escaped or what you will — and there was that about him god knows what — we 'd flayed another had he tried it on us that made as many of us as had wits more fond of all his easy distances than one another 's noise and clap-your-shoulder but think you not my friend he 'd never talk talk he was eldritch at it and we listened — thereby acquiring much we knew before about ourselves and hitherto had held irrelevant or not prime to the purpose and there were some of course and there be now disordered and reduced amazedly to resignation by the mystic seal of young finality the gods had laid on everything that made him a young demon and one or two shot looks at him already as he had been their executioner and once or twice he was not knowing it — or knowing being sorry for poor clay and saying nothing ... yet for all his engines you 'll meet a thousand of an afternoon who strut and sun themselves and see around 'em a world made out of more that has a reason than his i swear that he sees here to-day though he may scarcely give a fool an exit but we mark how he sees in everything a law that given we flout it once too often brings fire and iron down on our naked heads to me it looks as if the power that made him for fear of giving all things to one creature left out the first — faith innocence illusion whatever 't is that keeps us out o bedlam — and thereby for his too consuming vision empowered him out of nature though to see him you 'd never guess what 's going on inside him he 'll break out some day like a keg of ale with too much independent frenzy in it and all for collaring what he knows wo n't keep and what he 'd best forget — but that he ca n't you 'll have it and have more than i 'm foretelling and there 'll be such a roaring at the globe as never stunned the bleeding gladiators he 'll have to change the color of its hair a bit for now he calls it cleopatra black hair would never do for cleopatra but you and i are not yet two old women and you 're a man of office what he does is more to you than how it is he does it — and that 's what the lord god has never told him they work together and the devil helps 'em they do it of a morning or if not they do it of a night in which event he 's peevish of a morning he seems old he 's not the proper stomach or the sleep — and they 're two sovran agents to conserve him against the fiery art that has no mercy but what 's in that prodigious grand new house i gather something happening in his boyhood fulfilled him with a boy 's determination to make all stratford 'ware of him well well i hope at last he 'll have his joy of it and all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves and frogs and owls and unicorns moreover be less than hell to his attendant ears oh past a doubt we 'll all go down to see him he may be wise with london two days off down there some wind of heaven may yet revive him but there 's no quickening breath from anywhere small make of him again the poised young faun from warwickshire who 'd made it seems already a legend of himself before i came to blink before the last of his first lightning whatever there be there 'll be no more of that the coming on of his old monster time has made him a still man and he has dreams were fair to think on once and all found hollow he knows how much of what men paint themselves would blister in the light of what they are he sees how much of what was great now shares an eminence transformed and ordinary he knows too much of what the world has hushed in others to be loud now for himself he knows now at what height low enemies may reach his heart and high friends let him fall but what not even such as he may know bedevils him the worst his lark may sing at heaven 's gate how he will and for as long as joy may listen but he sees no gate save one whereat the spent clay waits a little before the churchyard has it and the worm not long ago late in an afternoon i came on him unseen down lambeth way and on my life i was afear 'd of him he gloomed and mumbled like a soul from tophet his hands behind him and his head bent solemn `` what is it now '' said i — `` another woman '' that made him sorry for me and he smiled `` no ben '' he mused `` it 's nothing it 's all nothing we come we go and when we 're done we 're done '' spiders and flies — we 're mostly one or t'other — we come we go and when we 're done we 're done '' by god you sing that song as if you knew it '' said i by way of cheering him `` what ails ye '' `` i think i must have come down here to think '' says he to that and pulls his little beard '' your fly will serve as well as anybody and what 's his hour he flies and flies and flies and in his fly 's mind has a brave appearance and then your spider gets him in her net and eats him out and hangs him up to dry that 's nature the kind mother of us all and then your slattern housemaid swings her broom and where 's your spider and that 's nature also it 's nature and it 's nothing it 's all nothing it 's all a world where bugs and emperors go singularly back to the same dust each in his time and the old ordered stars that sang together ben will sing the same old stave to-morrow '' when he talks like that there 's nothing for a human man to do but lead him to some grateful nook like this where we be now and there to make him drink he 'll drink for love of me and then be sick a sad sign always in a man of parts and always very ominous the great should be as large in liquor as in love — and our great friend is not so large in either one disaffects him and the other fails him whatso he drinks that has an antic in it he 's wondering what 's to pay in his insides and while his eyes are on the cyprian he 's fribbling all the time with that damned house we laugh here at his thrift but after all it may be thrift that saves him from the devil god gave it anyhow — and we 'll suppose he knew the compound of his handiwork to-day the clouds are with him but anon he 'll out of 'em enough to shake the tree of life itself and bring down fruit unheard-of — and throwing in the bruised and whole together prepare a wine to make us drunk with wonder and if he live there 'll be a sunset spell thrown over him as over a glassed lake that yesterday was all a black wild water god send he live to give us if no more what now 's a-rampage in him and exhibit with a decent half-allegiance to the ages an earnest of at least a casual eye turned once on what he owes to gutenberg and to the fealty of more centuries than are as yet a picture in our vision `` there 's time enough — i 'll do it when i 'm old and we 're immortal men '' he says to that and then he says to me `` ben what 's 'immortal think you by any force of ordination it may be nothing of a sort more noisy than a small oblivion of component ashes that of a dream-addicted world was once a moving atomy much like your friend here '' nothing will help that man to make him laugh i said then he was a mad mountebank — and by the lord i nearer made him cry i could have eat an eft then on my knees tail claws and all of him for i had stung the king of men who had no sting for me and i had hurt him in his memories and i say now as i shall say again i love the man this side idolatry he 'll do it when he 's old he says i wonder he may not be so ancient as all that for such as he the thing that is to do will do itself — but there 's a reckoning the sessions that are now too much his own the roiling inward of a stilled outside the churning out of all those blood-fed lines the nights of many schemes and little sleep the full brain hammered hot with too much thinking the vexed heart over-worn with too much aching — this weary jangling of conjoined affairs made out of elements that have no end and all confused at once i understand is not what makes a man to live forever o no not now he 'll not be going now there 'll be time yet for god knows what explosions before he goes he 'll stay awhile just wait just wait a year or two for cleopatra for she 's to be a balsam and a comfort and that 's not all a jape of mine now either for granted once the old way of apollo sings in a man he may then if he 's able strike unafraid whatever strings he will upon the last and wildest of new lyres nor out of his new magic though it hymn the shrieks of dungeoned hell shall he create a madness or a gloom to shut quite out a cleaving daylight and a last great calm triumphant over shipwreck and all storms he might have given aristotle creeps but surely would have given him his katharsis he 'll not be going yet there 's too much yet unsung within the man but when he goes i 'd stake ye coin o the realm his only care for a phantom world he sounded and found wanting will be a portion here a portion there of this or that thing or some other thing that has a patent and intrinsical equivalence in those egregious shillings and yet he knows god help him tell me now if ever there was anything let loose on earth by gods or devils heretofore like this mad careful proud indifferent shakespeare where was it if it ever was by heaven 'twas never yet in rhodes or pergamon — in thebes or nineveh a thing like this no thing like this was ever out of england and that he knows i wonder if he cares perhaps he does ... o lord that house in stratford

where the remote bermudas ride in th ’ ocean ’ s bosom unespy ’ d from a small boat that row ’ d along the list ’ ning winds receiv ’ d this song what should we do but sing his praise that led us through the wat ’ ry maze unto an isle so long unknown and yet far kinder than our own where he the huge sea-monsters wracks that lift the deep upon their backs he lands us on a grassy stage safe from the storm ’ s and prelates ’ rage he gave us this eternal spring which here enamels everything and sends the fowls to us in care on daily visits through the air he hangs in shades the orange bright like golden lamps in a green night and does in the pomegranates close jewels more rich than ormus shows he makes the figs our mouths to meet and throws the melons at our feet but apples plants of such a price no tree could ever bear them twice with cedars chosen by his hand from lebanon he stores the land and makes the hollow seas that roar proclaim the ambergris on shore he cast of which we rather boast the gospel ’ s pearl upon our coast and in these rocks for us did frame a temple where to sound his name oh let our voice his praise exalt till it arrive at heaven ’ s vault which thence perhaps rebounding may echo beyond the mexic bay thus sung they in the english boat an holy and a cheerful note and all the way to guide their chime with falling oars they kept the time
the best game the fairies play the best game of all is sliding down steeples— you know they ’ re very tall you fly to the weathercock and when you hear it crow you fold your wings and clutch your things and then let go they have a million other games— cloud-catching ’ s one and mud-mixing after rain is heaps and heaps of fun but when you go and stay with them never mind the rest take my advice—they ’ re very nice but steeple-sliding ’ s best
in the desolate depths of a perilous place the bogeyman lurks with a snarl on his face never dare never dare to approach his dark lair for he 's waiting just waiting to get you he skulks in the shadows relentless and wild in his search for a tender delectable child with his steely sharp claws and his slavering jaws oh he 's waiting just waiting to get you many have entered his dreary domain but not even one has been heard from again they no doubt made a feast for the butchering beast and he 's waiting just waiting to get you in that sulphurous sunless and sinister place he 'll crumple your bones in his bogey embrace never never go near if you hold your life dear for oh what he 'll do when he gets you

my love looks like a girl to-night but she is old the plaits that lie along her pillow are not gold but threaded with filigree silver and uncanny cold she looks like a young maiden since her brow is smooth and fair her cheeks are very smooth her eyes are closed she sleeps a rare still winsome sleep so still and so composed nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her dreams of perfect things she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream and her dead mouth sings by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings

holding only a handful of rushlight they pressed deeper into the dark at a crouch until the great rock chamber flowered around them and they stood in an enormous womb of flickering light and darklight a place to make a start raised hands cast flapping shadows over the sleeker shapes of radiance they 've left the world of weather and panic behind them and gone on in drawing the dark in their wake pushing as one pulse to the core of stone the pigments mixed in big shells are crushed ore petals and pollens berries and the binding juices oozed out of chosen barks the beasts begin to take shape from hands and feather-tufts soaked in ochre manganese madder mallow white stroking the live rock letting slopes and contours mould those forms from chance coaxing rigid dips and folds and bulges to lend themselves to necks bellies swelling haunches a forehead or a twist of horn tails and manes curling to a crazy gallop intent and human they attach the mineral vegetable animal realms to themselves inscribing the one unbroken line everything depends on from that impenetrable centre to the outer intangibles of light and air even the speed of the horse the bison 's fear the arc of gentleness that this big-bellied cow arches over its spindling calf or the lancing dance of death that bristles out of the buck's struck flank on this one line they leave a beak-headed human figure of sticks and one small chalky human hand we 'll never know if they worked in silence like people praying—the way our monks illuminated their own dark ages in cross-hatched rocky cloisters where they contrived a binding labyrinth of lit affinities to spell out in nature 's lace and fable their mindful blinding sixth sense of a god of shadows—or whether like birds tracing their great bloodlines over the globe they kept a constant gossip up of praise encouragement complaint it does n't matter we know they went with guttering rushlight into the dark came to terms with the given world must have had —as their hands moved steadily by spiderlight—one desire we 'd recognise they would—before going on beyond this border zone this nowhere that is now here—leave something upright and bright behind them in the dark
`` as certain also of your own poets have said '' — acts 17.28 cleon the poet from the sprinkled isles lily on lily that o'erlace the sea and laugh their pride when the light wave lisps `` greece '' — to protus in his tyranny much health they give thy letter to me even now i read and seem as if i heard thee speak the master of thy galley still unlades gift after gift they block my court at last and pile themselves along its portico royal with sunset like a thought of thee and one white she-slave from the group dispersed of black and white slaves like the chequer-work pavement at once my nation 's work and gift now covered with this settle-down of doves one lyric woman in her crocus vest woven of sea-wools with her two white hands commends to me the strainer and the cup thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses mine well-counselled king in thy munificence for so shall men remark in such an act of love for him whose song gives life its joy — thy recognition of the use of life nor call thy spirit barely adequate to help on life in straight ways broad enough for vulgar souls by ruling and the rest thou in the daily building of thy tower — whether in fierce and sudden spasms of toil or through dim lulls of unapparent growth or when the general work 'mid good acclaim climbed with the eye to cheer the architect — didst ne'er engage in work for mere work 's sake— hadst ever in thy heart the luring hope of some eventual rest a-top of it whence all the tumult of the building hushed thou first of men might'st look out to the east the vulgar saw thy tower thou sawest the sun for this i promise on thy festival to pour libation looking o'er the sea making this slave narrate thy fortunes speak thy great words and describe thy royal face— wishing thee wholly where zeus lives the most within the eventual element of calm thy letter 's first requirement meets me here it is as thou hast heard in one short life i cleon have effected all those things thou wonderingly dost enumerate that epos on thy hundred plates of gold is mine —and also mine the little chant so sure to rise from every fishing-bark when lights at prow the seamen haul their net the image of the sun-god on the phare men turn from the sun 's self to see is mine the pœcile o'er-storied its whole length as thou didst hear with painting is mine too i know the true proportions of a man and woman also not observed before and i have written three books on the soul proving absurd all written hitherto and putting us to ignorance again for music —why i have combined the moods inventing one in brief all arts are mine thus much the people know and recognize throughout our seventeen islands marvel not we of these latter days with greater mind than our forerunners since more composite look not so great beside their simple way to a judge who only sees one way at once one mind-point and no other at a time — compares the small part of a man of us with some whole man of the heroic age great in his way—not ours nor meant for ours and ours is greater had we skill to know for what we call this life of men on earth this sequence of the soul 's achievements here being as i find much reason to conceive intended to be viewed eventually as a great whole not analyzed to parts but each part having reference to all — how shall a certain part pronounced complete endure effacement by another part was the thing done —then what 's to do again see in the chequered pavement opposite suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb and next a lozenge then a trapezoid— he did not overlay them superimpose the new upon the old and blot it out but laid them on a level in his work making at last a picture there it lies so first the perfect separate forms were made the portions of mankind and after so occurred the combination of the same for where had been a progress otherwise mankind made up of all the single men — in such a synthesis the labour ends now mark me those divine men of old time have reached thou sayest well each at one point the outside verge that rounds our faculty and where they reached who can do more than reach it takes but little water just to touch at some one point the inside of a sphere and as we turn the sphere touch all the rest in due succession but the finer air which not so palpably nor obviously though no less universally can touch the whole circumference of that emptied sphere fills it more fully than the water did holds thrice the weight of water in itself resolved into a subtler element and yet the vulgar call the sphere first full up to the visible height—and after void not knowing air 's more hidden properties and thus our soul misknown cries out to zeus to vindicate his purpose in our life why stay we on the earth unless to grow long since i imaged wrote the fiction out that he or other god descended here and once for all showed simultaneously what in its nature never can be shown piecemeal or in succession —showed i say the worth both absolute and relative of all his children from the birth of time his instruments for all appointed work i now go on to image —might we hear the judgment which should give the due to each show where the labour lay and where the ease and prove zeus self the latent everywhere this is a dream —but no dream let us hope that years and days the summers and the springs follow each other with unwaning powers the grapes which dye thy wine are richer far through culture than the wild wealth of the rock the suave plum than the savage-tasted drupe the pastured honey-bee drops choicer sweet the flowers turn double and the leaves turn flowers that young and tender crescent-moon thy slave sleeping above her robe as buoyed by clouds refines upon the women of my youth what and the soul alone deteriorates i have not chanted verse like homer no— nor swept string like terpander no—nor carved and painted men like phidias and his friend i am not great as they are point by point but i have entered into sympathy with these four running these into one soul who separate ignored each other 's art say is it nothing that i know them all the wild flower was the larger i have dashed rose-blood upon its petals pricked its cup's honey with wine and driven its seed to fruit and show a better flower if not so large i stand myself refer this to the gods whose gift alone it is which shall i dare all pride apart upon the absurd pretext that such a gift by chance lay in my hand discourse of lightly or depreciate it might have fallen to another 's hand what then i pass too surely let at least truth stay and next of what thou followest on to ask this being with me as i declare o king my works in all these varicoloured kinds so done by me accepted so by men— thou askest if my soul thus in men 's hearts i must not be accounted to attain the very crown and proper end of life inquiring thence how now life closeth up i face death with success in my right hand whether i fear death less than dost thyself the fortunate of men `` for '' writest thou '' thou leavest much behind while i leave nought thy life stays in the poems men shall sing the pictures men shall study while my life complete and whole now in its power and joy dies altogether with my brain and arm is lost indeed since what survives myself the brazen statue to o'erlook my grave set on the promontory which i named and that—some supple courtier of my heir shall use its robed and sceptred arm perhaps to fix the rope to which best drags it down i go then triumph thou who dost not go '' nay thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind is this apparent when thou turn'st to muse upon the scheme of earth and man in chief that admiration grows as knowledge grows that imperfection means perfection hid reserved in part to grace the after-time if in the morning of philosophy ere aught had been recorded nay perceived thou with the light now in thee couldst have looked on all earth 's tenantry from worm to bird ere man her last appeared upon the stage— thou wouldst have seen them perfect and deduced the perfectness of others yet unseen conceding which —had zeus then questioned thee '' shall i go on a step improve on this do more for visible creatures than is done '' thou wouldst have answered `` ay by making each grow conscious in himself—by that alone all 's perfect else the shell sucks fast the rock the fish strikes through the sea the snake both swims and slides forth range the beasts the birds take flight till life 's mechanics can no further go— and all this joy in natural life is put like fire from off thy finger into each so exquisitely perfect is the same but 't is pure fire and they mere matter are it has them not they it and so i choose for man thy last premeditated work if i might add a glory to the scheme that a third thing should stand apart from both a quality arise within his soul which intro-active made to supervise and feel the force it has may view itself and so be happy '' man might live at first the animal life but is there nothing more in due time let him critically learn how he lives and the more he gets to know of his own life 's adaptabilities the more joy-giving will his life become thus man who hath this quality is best but thou king hadst more reasonably said '' let progress end at once —man make no step beyond the natural man the better beast using his senses not the sense of sense '' in man there 's failure only since he left the lower and inconscious forms of life we called it an advance the rendering plain man 's spirit might grow conscious of man 's life and by new lore so added to the old take each step higher over the brute 's head this grew the only life the pleasure-house watch-tower and treasure-fortress of the soul which whole surrounding flats of natural life seemed only fit to yield subsistence to a tower that crowns a country but alas the soul now climbs it just to perish there for thence we have discovered 't is no dream— we know this which we had not else perceived that there 's a world of capability for joy spread round about us meant for us inviting us and still the soul craves all and still the flesh replies `` take no jot more than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad nay so much less as that fatigue has brought deduction to it '' we struggle fain to enlarge our bounded physical recipiency increase our power supply fresh oil to life repair the waste of age and sickness no it skills not life 's inadequate to joy as the soul sees joy tempting life to take they praise a fountain in my garden here wherein a naiad sends the water-bow thin from her tube she smiles to see it rise what if i told her it is just a thread from that great river which the hills shut up and mock her with my leave to take the same the artificer has given her one small tube past power to widen or exchange—what boots to know she might spout oceans if she could she can not lift beyond her first thin thread and so a man can use but a man 's joy while he sees god 's is it for zeus to boast '' see man how happy i live and despair— that i may be still happier—for thy use '' if this were so we could not thank our lord as hearts beat on to doing 't is not so— malice it is not is it carelessness still no if care—where is the sign i ask and get no answer and agree in sum o king with thy profound discouragement who seest the wider but to sigh the more most progress is most failure thou sayest well the last point now —thou dost except a case— holding joy not impossible to one with artist-gifts—to such a man as i who leave behind me living works indeed for such a poem such a painting lives what dost thou verily trip upon a word confound the accurate view of what joy is caught somewhat clearer by my eyes than thine with feeling joy confound the knowing how and showing how to live my faculty with actually living —otherwise where is the artist 's vantage o'er the king because in my great epos i display how divers men young strong fair wise can act— is this as though i acted if i paint carve the young phoebus am i therefore young methinks i 'm older that i bowed myself the many years of pain that taught me art indeed to know is something and to prove how all this beauty might be enjoyed is more but knowing nought to enjoy is something too yon rower with the moulded muscles there lowering the sail is nearer it than i. i can write love-odes thy fair slave 's an ode i get to sing of love when grown too grey for being beloved she turns to that young man the muscles all a-ripple on his back i know the joy of kingship well thou art king `` but '' sayest thou— and i marvel i repeat to find thee trip on such a mere word `` what thou writest paintest stays that does not die sappho survives because we sing her songs and aeschylus because we read his plays '' why if they live still let them come and take thy slave in my despite drink from thy cup speak in my place thou diest while i survive say rather that my fate is deadlier still in this that every day my sense of joy grows more acute my soul intensified by power and insight more enlarged more keen while every day my hairs fall more and more my hand shakes and the heavy years increase— the horror quickening still from year to year the consummation coming past escape when i shall know most and yet least enjoy— when all my works wherein i prove my worth being present still to mock me in men 's mouths alive still in the praise of such as thou i i the feeling thinking acting man the man who loved his life so over-much sleep in my urn it is so horrible i dare at times imagine to my need some future state revealed to us by zeus unlimited in capability for joy as this is in desire for joy —to seek which the joy-hunger forces us that stung by straitness of our life made strait on purpose to make prized the life at large— freed by the throbbing impulse we call death we burst there as the worm into the fly who while a worm still wants his wings but no zeus has not yet revealed it and alas he must have done so were it possible live long and happy and in that thought die glad for what was farewell and for the rest i can not tell thy messenger aright where to deliver what he bears of thine to one called paulus we have heard his fame indeed if christus be not one with him— i know not nor am troubled much to know thou canst not think a mere barbarian jew as paulus proves to be one circumcised hath access to a secret shut from us thou wrongest our philosophy o king in stooping to inquire of such an one as if his answer could impose at all he writeth doth he well and he may write oh the jew findeth scholars certain slaves who touched on this same isle preached him and christ and as i gathered from a bystander their doctrine could be held by no sane man
mist clogs the sunshine smoky dwarf houses hem me round everywhere a vague dejection weighs down my soul yet while i languish everywhere countless prospects unroll themselves and countless beings pass countless moods far hence in asia on the smooth convent-roofs on the gilt terraces of holy lassa bright shines the sun grey time-worn marbles hold the pure muses in their cool gallery by yellow tiber they still look fair strange unloved uproar shrills round their portal yet not on helicon kept they more cloudless their noble calm through sun-proof alleys in a lone sand-hemm'd city of africa a blind led beggar age-bow 'd asks alms no bolder robber erst abode ambush'd deep in the sandy waste no clearer eyesight spied prey afar saharan sand-winds sear 'd his keen eyeballs spent is the spoil he won for him the present holds only pain two young fair lovers where the warm june-wind fresh from the summer fields plays fondly round them stand tranced in joy with sweet join 'd voices and with eyes brimming '' ah '' they cry `` destiny prolong the present time stand still here '' the prompt stern goddess shakes her head frowning time gives his hour-glass its due reversal their hour is gone with weak indulgence did the just goddess lengthen their happiness she lengthen 'd also distress elsewhere the hour whose happy unalloy 'd moments i would eternalise ten thousand mourners well pleased see end the bleak stern hour whose severe moments i would annihilate is pass 'd by others in warmth light joy time so complain 'd of who to no one man shows partiality brings round to all men some undimm 'd hours
a mountainous and mystic brute no rein can curb no arrow shoot upon whose doomed deformed back i sweep the planets ’ scorching track old is the elf and wise men say his hair grows green as ours grows grey he mocks the stars with myriad hands high as that swinging forest stands but though in pigmy wanderings dull i scour the deserts of his skull i never find the face eyes teeth lowering or laughing underneath i met my foe in an empty dell his face in the sun was naked hell i thought ‘ one silent bloody blow no priest would curse no crowd would know. ’ then cowered a daisy half concealed watched for the fame of that poor field and in that flower and suddenly earth opened its one eye on me
cold eyelids that hide like a jewel hard eyes that grow soft for an hour the heavy white limbs and the cruel red mouth like a venomous flower when these are gone by with their glories what shall rest of thee then what remain o mystic and sombre dolores our lady of pain seven sorrows the priests give their virgin but thy sins which are seventy times seven seven ages would fail thee to purge in and then they would haunt thee in heaven fierce midnights and famishing morrows and the loves that complete and control all the joys of the flesh all the sorrows that wear out the soul o garment not golden but gilded o garden where all men may dwell o tower not of ivory but builded by hands that reach heaven from hell o mystical rose of the mire o house not of gold but of gain o house of unquenchable fire our lady of pain o lips full of lust and of laughter curled snakes that are fed from my breast bite hard lest remembrance come after and press with new lips where you pressed for my heart too springs up at the pressure mine eyelids too moisten and burn ah feed me and fill me with pleasure ere pain come in turn in yesterday 's reach and to-morrow 's out of sight though they lie of to-day there have been and there yet shall be sorrows that smite not and bite not in play the life and the love thou despisest these hurt us indeed and in vain o wise among women and wisest our lady of pain who gave thee thy wisdom what stories that stung thee what visions that smote wert thou pure and a maiden dolores when desire took thee first by the throat what bud was the shell of a blossom that all men may smell to and pluck what milk fed thee first at what bosom what sins gave thee suck we shift and bedeck and bedrape us thou art noble and nude and antique libitina thy mother priapus thy father a tuscan and greek we play with light loves in the portal and wince and relent and refrain loves die and we know thee immortal our lady of pain fruits fail and love dies and time ranges thou art fed with perpetual breath and alive after infinite changes and fresh from the kisses of death of languors rekindled and rallied of barren delights and unclean things monstrous and fruitless a pallid and poisonous queen could you hurt me sweet lips though i hurt you men touch them and change in a trice the lilies and languors of virtue for the raptures and roses of vice those lie where thy foot on the floor is these crown and caress thee and chain o splendid and sterile dolores our lady of pain there are sins it may be to discover there are deeds it may be to delight what new work wilt thou find for thy lover what new passions for daytime or night what spells that they know not a word of whose lives are as leaves overblown what tortures undreamt of unheard of unwritten unknown ah beautiful passionate body that never has ached with a heart on thy mouth though the kisses are bloody though they sting till it shudder and smart more kind than the love we adore is they hurt not the heart or the brain o bitter and tender dolores our lady of pain as our kisses relax and redouble from the lips and the foam and the fangs shall no new sin be born for men 's trouble no dream of impossible pangs with the sweet of the sins of old ages wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore too sweet is the rind say the sages too bitter the core hast thou told all thy secrets the last time and bared all thy beauties to one ah where shall we go then for pastime if the worst that can be has been done but sweet as the rind was the core is we are fain of thee still we are fain o sanguine and subtle dolores our lady of pain by the hunger of change and emotion by the thirst of unbearable things by despair the twin-born of devotion by the pleasure that winces and stings the delight that consumes the desire the desire that outruns the delight by the cruelty deaf as a fire and blind as the night by the ravenous teeth that have smitten through the kisses that blossom and bud by the lips intertwisted and bitten till the foam has a savour of blood by the pulse as it rises and falters by the hands as they slacken and strain i adjure thee respond from thine altars our lady of pain wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining the light fire in the veins of a boy but he comes to thee sad without feigning who has wearied of sorrow and joy less careful of labour and glory than the elders whose hair has uncurled and young but with fancies as hoary and grey as the world i have passed from the outermost portal to the shrine where a sin is a prayer what care though the service be mortal o our lady of torture what care all thine the last wine that i pour is the last in the chalice we drain o fierce and luxurious dolores our lady of pain all thine the new wine of desire the fruit of four lips as they clung till the hair and the eyelids took fire the foam of a serpentine tongue the froth of the serpents of pleasure more salt than the foam of the sea now felt as a flame now at leisure as wine shed for me ah thy people thy children thy chosen marked cross from the womb and perverse they have found out the secret to cozen the gods that constrain us and curse they alone they are wise and none other give me place even me in their train o my sister my spouse and my mother our lady of pain for the crown of our life as it closes is darkness the fruit thereof dust no thorns go as deep as a rose 's and love is more cruel than lust time turns the old days to derision our loves into corpses or wives and marriage and death and division make barren our lives and pale from the past we draw nigh thee and satiate with comfortless hours and we know thee how all men belie thee and we gather the fruit of thy flowers the passion that slays and recovers the pangs and the kisses that rain on the lips and the limbs of thy lovers our lady of pain the desire of thy furious embraces is more than the wisdom of years on the blossom though blood lie in traces though the foliage be sodden with tears for the lords in whose keeping the door is that opens on all who draw breath gave the cypress to love my dolores the myrtle to death and they laughed changing hands in the measure and they mixed and made peace after strife pain melted in tears and was pleasure death tingled with blood and was life like lovers they melted and tingled in the dusk of thine innermost fane in the darkness they murmured and mingled our lady of pain in a twilight where virtues are vices in thy chapels unknown of the sun to a tune that enthralls and entices they were wed and the twain were as one for the tune from thine altar hath sounded since god bade the world 's work begin and the fume of thine incense abounded to sweeten the sin love listens and paler than ashes through his curls as the crown on them slips lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes and laughs with insatiable lips thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses with music that scares the profane thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses our lady of pain thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive in his lips all thy serpents shall nestle in his hands all thy cruelties thrive in the daytime thy voice shall go through him in his dreams he shall feel thee and ache thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him asleep and awake thou shalt touch and make redder his roses with juice not of fruit nor of bud when the sense in the spirit reposes thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood thine thine the one grace we implore is who would live and not languish or feign o sleepless and deadly dolores our lady of pain dost thou dream in a respite of slumber in a lull of the fires of thy life of the days without name without number when thy will stung the world into strife when a goddess the pulse of thy passion smote kings as they revelled in rome and they hailed thee re-risen o thalassian foam-white from the foam when thy lips had such lovers to flatter when the city lay red from thy rods and thine hands were as arrows to scatter the children of change and their gods when the blood of thy foemen made fervent a sand never moist from the main as one smote them their lord and thy servant our lady of pain on sands by the storm never shaken nor wet from the washing of tides nor by foam of the waves overtaken nor winds that the thunder bestrides but red from the print of thy paces made smooth for the world and its lords ringed round with a flame of fair faces and splendid with swords there the gladiator pale for thy pleasure drew bitter and perilous breath there torments laid hold on the treasure of limbs too delicious for death when thy gardens were lit with live torches when the world was a steed for thy rein when the nations lay prone in thy porches our lady of pain when with flame all around him aspirant stood flushed as a harp-player stands the implacable beautiful tyrant rose-crowned having death in his hands and a sound as the sound of loud water smote far through the flight of the fires and mixed with the lightning of slaughter a thunder of lyres dost thou dream of what was and no more is the old kingdoms of earth and the kings dost thou hunger for these things dolores for these in a world of new things but thy bosom no fasts could emaciate no hunger compel to complain those lips that no bloodshed could satiate our lady of pain as of old when the world 's heart was lighter through thy garments the grace of thee glows the white wealth of thy body made whiter by the blushes of amorous blows and seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers and branded by kisses that bruise when all shall be gone that now lingers ah what shall we lose thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion and thy limbs are as melodies yet and move to the music of passion with lithe and lascivious regret what ailed us o gods to desert you for creeds that refuse and restrain come down and redeem us from virtue our lady of pain all shrines that were vestal are flameless but the flame has not fallen from this though obscure be the god and though nameless the eyes and the hair that we kiss low fires that love sits by and forges fresh heads for his arrows and thine hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies with kisses and wine thy skin changes country and colour and shrivels or swells to a snake 's let it brighten and bloat and grow duller we know it the flames and the flakes red brands on it smitten and bitten round skies where a star is a stain and the leaves with thy litanies written our lady of pain on thy bosom though many a kiss be there are none such as knew it of old was it alciphron once or arisbe male ringlets or feminine gold that thy lips met with under the statue whence a look shot out sharp after thieves from the eyes of the garden-god at you across the fig-leaves then still through dry seasons and moister one god had a wreath to his shrine then love was the pearl of his oyster and venus rose red out of wine we have all done amiss choosing rather such loves as the wise gods disdain intercede for us thou with thy father our lady of pain in spring he had crowns of his garden red corn in the heat of the year then hoary green olives that harden when the grape-blossom freezes with fear and milk-budded myrtles with venus and vine-leaves with bacchus he trod and ye said `` we have seen he hath seen us a visible god '' what broke off the garlands that girt you what sundered you spirit and clay weak sins yet alive are as virtue to the strength of the sins of that day for dried is the blood of thy lover ipsithilla contracted the vein cry aloud `` will he rise and recover our lady of pain '' cry aloud for the old world is broken cry out for the phrygian is priest and rears not the bountiful token and spreads not the fatherly feast from the midmost of ida from shady recesses that murmur at morn they have brought and baptized her our lady a goddess new-born and the chaplets of old are above us and the oyster-bed teems out of reach old poets outsing and outlove us and catullus makes mouths at our speech who shall kiss in thy father 's own city with such lips as he sang with again intercede for us all of thy pity our lady of pain out of dindymus heavily laden her lions draw bound and unfed a mother a mortal a maiden a queen over death and the dead she is cold and her habit is lowly her temple of branches and sods most fruitful and virginal holy a mother of gods she hath wasted with fire thine high places she hath hidden and marred and made sad the fair limbs of the loves the fair faces of gods that were goodly and glad she slays and her hands are not bloody she moves as a moon in the wane white-robed and thy raiment is ruddy our lady of pain they shall pass and their places be taken the gods and the priests that are pure they shall pass and shalt thou not be shaken they shall perish and shalt thou endure death laughs breathing close and relentless in the nostrils and eyelids of lust with a pinch in his fingers of scentless and delicate dust but the worm shall revive thee with kisses thou shalt change and transmute as a god as the rod to a serpent that hisses as the serpent again to a rod thy life shall not cease though thou doff it thou shalt live until evil be slain and good shall die first said thy prophet our lady of pain did he lie did he laugh does he know it now he lies out of reach out of breath thy prophet thy preacher thy poet sin 's child by incestuous death did he find out in fire at his waking or discern as his eyelids lost light when the bands of the body were breaking and all came in sight who has known all the evil before us or the tyrannous secrets of time though we match not the dead men that bore us at a song at a kiss at a crime — though the heathen outface and outlive us and our lives and our longings are twain — ah forgive us our virtues forgive us our lady of pain who are we that embalm and embrace thee with spices and savours of song what is time that his children should face thee what am i that my lips do thee wrong i could hurt thee — but pain would delight thee or caress thee — but love would repel and the lovers whose lips would excite thee are serpents in hell who now shall content thee as they did thy lovers when temples were built and the hair of the sacrifice braided and the blood of the sacrifice spilt in lampsacus fervent with faces in aphaca red from thy reign who embraced thee with awful embraces our lady of pain where are they cotytto or venus astarte or ashtaroth where do their hands as we touch come between us is the breath of them hot in thy hair from their lips have thy lips taken fever with the blood of their bodies grown red hast thou left upon earth a believer if these men are dead they were purple of raiment and golden filled full of thee fiery with wine thy lovers in haunts unbeholden in marvellous chambers of thine they are fled and their footprints escape us who appraise thee adore and abstain o daughter of death and priapus our lady of pain what ails us to fear overmeasure to praise thee with timorous breath o mistress and mother of pleasure the one thing as certain as death we shall change as the things that we cherish shall fade as they faded before as foam upon water shall perish as sand upon shore we shall know what the darkness discovers if the grave-pit be shallow or deep and our fathers of old and our lovers we shall know if they sleep not or sleep we shall see whether hell be not heaven find out whether tares be not grain and the joys of thee seventy times seven

emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain 's brow there is a path on the sea 's azure floor no keel has ever plough 'd that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart 's sister wilt thou sail with me our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea treading each other 's heels unheededly it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remain 'd a solitude but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold the blue aegean girds this chosen home with ever-changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul—they seem like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle 'twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer wash 'd by the soft blue oceans of young air it is a favour 'd place famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain-peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the wingèd storms chanting their thunder-psalm to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality and from the sea there rise and from the sky there fall clear exhalations soft and bright veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle 's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island-people know 'tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean-king ere crime had been invented in the world 's young prime rear 'd it a wonder of that simple time an envy of the isles a pleasure-house made sacred to his sister and his spouse it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assum 'd its form then grown out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been eras 'd and in the place of it the ivy and the wild-vine interknit the volumes of their many-twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter-woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen or fragments of the day 's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another 's arms and dream of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality this isle and house are mine and i have vow'd thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but can not die folded within their own eternity our simple life wants little and true taste hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill the ring-dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love-lament and the owls flit round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measur 'd by the pants of their calm sleep be this our home in life and when years heap their wither 'd hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one meanwhile we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour or linger where the pebble-paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— possessing and possess 'd by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expir 'd night asleep through which the awaken 'd day can never peep a veil for our seclusion close as night 's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again and we will talk until thought 's melody become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being 's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be confus 'd in passion 's golden purity as mountain-springs under the morning sun we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh wherefore two one passion in twin-hearts which grows and grew till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigur 'd ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another 's substance finding food like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and can not pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation woe is me the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love 's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire— i pant i sink i tremble i expire

an emerald dungeon ’ s blacklight glow glimmered in the deeper reaches where my son and i could hear the slub of water riddling through the muck we ’ d stumbled on it following a stream his first cave made stranger still by a chill that closes on the goblined heart of a boy inflamed by stories where gnome-clans hoarded underground bone-shard mandrake monkey gland and eel and so grave hansel paying out his last scraps of bread he inched inward looking back and gathering himself as he devolved step by step along the wet-ribbed walls the omphalos seepage of a subterranea that dreamed us into its kingdom come where like some secret dreams make known the burnt-punk smell of marijuana cluttered up the air and just beyond just close enough to see a spur of light that like a dwindling eyemote disappeared then the sound a human soul makes as it slips out from the throat composed in darkness my son ’ s hand closed on mine i bent to whisper we could turn back now but his voice was there before me saying “ something ’ s here. ” and something was something that in that instant rose and moved off from us or drew up close in either case my son came to me almost weightlessly at first then hungry for what was filling up my arms the startled upriding bodyweight of a boy i ’ d never before felt rock so solidly into the place i was blind and hunkered in the earthen air i held him only a moment there we didn ’ t speak and though the wheeze of his breathing must ’ ve stopped my ears for weeks to come settling him back to sleep at night or waking him from some troubling dream i ’ d hear the soft concussion of an outsized heart- beat i could not decide was mine or his or the stranger ’ s i had brought us to or if what happened would happen again years from now when he is grown and i have grown newly strange to him

morning and evening maids heard the goblins cry “ come buy our orchard fruits come buy come buy apples and quinces lemons and oranges plump unpeck ’ d cherries melons and raspberries bloom-down-cheek

gooseberries bright-fire-like barberries figs to fill your mouth citrons from the south sweet to tongue and sound to eye come buy come buy. ” evening by evening among the brookside rushes laura bow ’ d her head to hear lizzie veil ’ d her blushes crouching close together in the cooling weather with clasping arms and cautioning lips with tingling cheeks and finger tips “ lie close ” laura said pricking up her golden head “ we must not look at goblin men we must not buy their fruits who knows upon what soil they fed their hungry thirsty roots ” “ come buy ” call the goblins hobbling down the glen “ oh ” cried lizzie “ laura laura you should not peep at goblin men. ” lizzie cover ’ d up her eyes cover ’ d close lest they should look laura rear ’ d her glossy head and whisper ’ d like the restless brook “ look lizzie look lizzie down the glen tramp little men one hauls a basket one bears a plate one lugs a golden dish of many pounds weight how fair the vine must grow whose grapes are so luscious how warm the wind must blow through those fruit bushes. ” “ no ” said lizzie “ no no no their offers should not charm us their evil gifts would harm us. ” she thrust a dimpled finger in each ear shut eyes and ran curious laura chose to linger wondering at each merchant man one had a cat ’ s face one whisk ’ d a tail one tramp ’ d at a rat ’ s pace one crawl ’ d like a snail one like a wombat prowl ’ d obtuse and furry one like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry she heard a voice like voice of doves cooing all together they sounded kind and full of loves in the pleasant weather laura stretch ’ d her gleaming neck like a rush-imbedded swan like a lily from the beck like a moonlit poplar branch like a vessel at the launch when its last restraint is gone backwards up the mossy glen turn ’ d and troop ’ d the goblin men with their shrill repeated cry “ come buy come buy. ” when they reach ’ d where laura was they stood stock still upon the moss leering at each other brother with queer brother signalling each other brother with sly brother one set his basket down one rear ’ d his plate one began to weave a crown of tendrils leaves and rough nuts brown men sell not such in any town one heav ’ d the golden weight of dish and fruit to offer her “ come buy come buy ” was still their cry laura stared but did not stir long ’ d but had no money the whisk-tail ’ d merchant bade her taste in tones as smooth as honey the cat-faced purr ’ d the rat-faced spoke a word of welcome and the snail-paced even was heard one parrot-voiced and jolly cried “ pretty goblin ” still for “ pretty polly ” — one whistled like a bird but sweet-tooth laura spoke in haste “ good folk i have no coin to take were to purloin i have no copper in my purse i have no silver either and all my gold is on the furze that shakes in windy weather above the rusty heather. ” “ you have much gold upon your head ” they answer ’ d all together “ buy from us with a golden curl. ” she clipp ’ d a precious golden lock she dropp ’ d a tear more rare than pearl then suck ’ d their fruit globes fair or red sweeter than honey from the rock stronger than man-rejoicing wine clearer than water flow ’ d that juice she never tasted such before how should it cloy with length of use she suck ’ d and suck ’ d and suck ’ d the more fruits which that unknown orchard bore she suck ’ d until her lips were sore then flung the emptied rinds away but gather ’ d up one kernel stone and knew not was it night or day as she turn ’ d home alone lizzie met her at the gate full of wise upbraidings “ dear you should not stay so late twilight is not good for maidens should not loiter in the glen in the haunts of goblin men do you not remember jeanie how she met them in the moonlight took their gifts both choice and many ate their fruits and wore their flowers pluck ’ d from bowers where summer ripens at all hours but ever in the noonlight she pined and pined away sought them by night and day found them no more but dwindled and grew grey then fell with the first snow while to this day no grass will grow where she lies low i planted daisies there a year ago that never blow you should not loiter so. ” “ nay hush ” said laura “ nay hush my sister i ate and ate my fill yet my mouth waters still to-morrow night i will buy more ” and kiss ’ d her “ have done with sorrow i ’ ll bring you plums to-morrow fresh on their mother twigs cherries worth getting you can not think what figs my teeth have met in what melons icy-cold piled on a dish of gold too huge for me to hold what peaches with a velvet nap pellucid grapes without one seed odorous indeed must be the mead whereon they grow and pure the wave they drink with lilies at the brink and sugar-sweet their sap. ” golden head by golden head like two pigeons in one nest folded in each other ’ s wings they lay down in their curtain ’ d bed like two blossoms on one stem like two flakes of new-fall ’ n snow like two wands of ivory tipp ’ d with

rights the house kneaded cakes of whitest wheat cakes for dainty mouths to eat next churn ’ d butter whipp ’ d up cream fed their poultry sat and sew ’ d talk ’ d as modest maidens should lizzie with an open heart laura in an absent dream one content one sick in part one warbling for the mere bright day ’ s delight one longing for the night at length slow evening came they went with pitchers to the reedy brook lizzie most placid in her look laura most like a leaping flame they drew the gurgling water from its deep lizzie pluck ’ d purple and rich golden flags then turning homeward said “ the sunset flushes those furthest loftiest crags come laura not another maiden lags no wilful squirrel wags the beasts and birds are fast asleep. ” but laura loiter ’ d still among the rushes and said the bank was steep and said the hour was early still the dew not fall ’ n the wind not chill listening ever but not catching the customary cry “ come buy come buy ” with its iterated jingle of sugar-baited words not for all her watching once discerning even one goblin racing whisking tumbling hobbling let alone the herds that used to tramp along the glen in groups or single of brisk fruit-merchant men till lizzie urged “ o laura come i hear the fruit-call but i dare not look you should not loiter longer at this brook come with me home the stars rise the moon bends her arc each glowworm winks her spark let us get home before the night grows dark for clouds may gather though this is summer weather put out the lights and drench us through then if we lost our way what should we do ” laura turn ’ d cold as stone to find her sister heard that cry alone that goblin cry “ come buy our fruits come buy. ” must she then buy no more such dainty fruit must she no more such succous pasture find gone deaf and blind her tree of life droop ’ d from the root she said not one word in her heart ’ s sore ache but peering thro ’ the dimness nought discerning trudg ’ d home her pitcher dripping all the way so crept to bed and lay silent till lizzie slept then sat up in a passionate yearning and gnash ’ d her teeth for baulk ’ d desire and wept as if her heart would break day after day night after night laura kept watch in vain in sullen silence of exceeding pain she never caught again the goblin cry “ come buy come buy ” — she never spied the goblin men hawking their fruits along the glen but when the noon wax ’ d bright her hair grew thin and grey she dwindled as the fair full moon doth turn to swift decay and burn her fire away one day remembering her kernel-stone she set it by a wall that faced the south dew ’ d it with tears hoped for a root watch ’ d for a waxing shoot but there came none it never saw the sun it never felt the trickling moisture run while with sunk eyes and faded mouth she dream ’ d of melons as a traveller sees false waves in desert drouth with shade of leaf-crown ’ d trees and burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze she no more swept the house tended the fowls or cows fetch ’ d honey kneaded cakes of wheat brought water from the brook but sat down listless in the chimney-nook and would not eat tender lizzie could not bear to watch her sister ’ s cankerous care yet not to share she night and morning caught the goblins ’ cry “ come buy our orchard fruits come buy come buy ” — beside the brook along the glen she heard the tramp of goblin men the yoke and stir poor laura could not hear long ’ d to buy fruit to comfort her but fear ’ d to pay too dear she thought of jeanie in her grave who should have been a bride but who for joys brides hope to have fell sick and died in her gay prime in earliest winter time with the first glazing rime with the first snow-fall of crisp winter time till laura dwindling seem ’ d knocking at death ’ s door then lizzie weigh ’ d no more better and worse but put a silver penny in her purse kiss ’ d laura cross ’ d the heath with clumps of furze at twilight halted by the brook and for the first time in her life began to listen and look laugh ’ d every goblin when they spied her peeping came towards her hobbling flying running leaping puffing and blowing chuckling clapping crowing clucking and gobbling mopping and mowing full of airs and graces pulling wry faces demure grimaces cat-like and rat-like ratel- and wombat-like snail-paced in a hurry parrot-voiced and whistler helter skelter hurry skurry chattering like magpies fluttering like pigeons gliding like fishes — hugg ’ d her and kiss ’ d her squeez ’ d and caress ’ d her stretch ’ d up their dishes panniers and plates “ look at our apples russet and dun bob at our cherries bite at our peaches citrons and dates grapes for the asking pears red with basking out in the sun plums on their twigs pluck them and suck them pomegranates figs. ” — “ good folk ” said lizzie mindful of jeanie “ give me much and many — held out her apron toss ’ d them her penny “ nay take a seat with us honour and eat with us ” they answer ’ d grinning “ our feast is but beginning night yet is early warm and dew-pearly wakeful and starry such fruits as these no man can carry half their bloom would fly half their dew would dry half their flavour would pass by sit down and feast with us be welcome guest with us cheer you and rest with us. ” — “ thank you ” said lizzie “ but one waits at home alone for me so without further parleying if you will not sell me any of your fruits though much and many give me back my silver penny i toss ’ d you for a fee. ” — they began to scratch their pates no longer wagging purring but visibly demurring grunting and snarling one call ’ d her proud cross-grain ’ d uncivil their tones wax ’ d loud their looks were evil lashing their tails they trod and hustled her elbow ’ d and jostled her claw ’ d with their nails barking mewing hissing mocking tore her gown and soil ’ d her stocking twitch ’ d her hair out by the roots stamp ’ d upon her tender feet held her hands and squeez ’ d their fruits against her mouth to make her eat white and golden lizzie stood like a lily in a flood — like a rock of blue-vein ’ d stone lash ’ d by tides obstreperously — like a beacon left alone in a hoary roaring sea sending up a golden fire — like a fruit-crown ’ d orange-tree white with blossoms honey-sweet sore beset by wasp and bee — like a royal virgin town topp ’ d with gilded dome and spire close beleaguer ’ d by a fleet mad to tug her standard down one may lead a horse to water twenty can not make him drink though the goblins cuff ’ d and caught her coax ’ d and fought her bullied and besought her scratch ’ d her pinch ’ d her black as ink kick ’ d and knock ’ d her maul ’ d and mock ’ d her lizzie utter ’ d not a word would not open lip from lip lest they should cram a mouthful in but laugh ’ d in heart to feel the drip of juice that syrupp ’ d all her face and lodg ’ d in dimples of her chin and streak ’ d her neck which quaked like curd at last the evil people worn out by her resistance flung back her penny kick ’ d their fruit along whichever road they took not leaving root or stone or shoot some writh ’ d into the ground some div ’ d into the brook with ring and ripple some scudded on the gale without a sound some vanish ’ d in the distance in a smart ache tingle lizzie went her way knew not was it night or day sprang up the bank tore thro ’ the furze threaded copse and dingle and heard her penny jingle bouncing in her purse — its bounce was music to her ear she ran and ran as if she fear ’ d some goblin man dogg ’ d her with gibe or curse or something worse but not one goblin scurried after nor was she prick ’ d by fear the kind heart made her windy-paced that urged her home quite out of breath with haste and inward laughter she cried “ laura ” up the garden “ did you miss me come and kiss me never mind my bruises hug me kiss me suck my juices squeez ’ d from goblin fruits for you goblin pulp and goblin dew eat me drink me love me laura make much of me for your sake i have braved the glen and had to do with goblin merchant men. ” laura started from her chair flung her arms up in the air clutch ’ d her hair “ lizzie lizzie have you tasted for my sake the fruit forbidden must your light like mine be hidden your young life like mine be wasted undone in mine undoing and ruin ’ d in my ruin thirsty canker ’ d goblin-ridden ” — she clung about her sister kiss ’ d and kiss ’ d and kiss ’ d her tears once again refresh ’ d her shrunken eyes dropping like rain after long sultry drouth shaking with aguish fear and pain she kiss ’ d and kiss ’ d her with a hungry mouth her lips began to scorch that juice was wormwood to her tongue she loath ’ d the feast writhing as one possess ’ d she leap ’ d and sung rent all her robe and wrung her hands in lamentable haste and beat her breast her locks stream ’ d like the torch borne by a racer at full speed or like the mane of horses in their flight or like an eagle when she stems the light straight toward the sun or like a caged thing freed or like a flying flag when armies run swift fire spread through her veins knock ’ d at her heart met the fire smouldering there and overbore its lesser flame she gorged on bitterness without a name ah fool to choose such part of soul-consuming care sense fail ’ d in the mortal strife like the watch-tower of a town which an earthquake shatters down like a lightning-stricken mast like a wind-uprooted tree spun about like a foam-topp ’ d waterspout cast down headlong in the sea she fell at last pleasure past and anguish past is it death or is it life life out of death that night long lizzie watch ’ d by her counted her pulse ’ s flagging stir felt for her breath held water to her lips and cool ’ d her face with tears and fanning leaves but when the first birds chirp ’ d about their eaves and early reapers plodded to the place of golden sheaves and dew-wet grass bow ’ d in the morning winds so brisk to pass and new buds with new day open ’ d of cup-like lilies on the stream laura awoke as from a dream laugh ’ d in the innocent old way hugg ’ d lizzie but not twice or thrice her gleaming locks show ’ d not one thread of grey her breath was sweet as may and light danced in her eyes days weeks months years afterwards when both were wives with children of their own their mother-hearts beset with fears their lives bound up in tender lives laura would call the little ones and tell them of her early prime those pleasant days long gone of not-returning time would talk about the haunted glen the wicked quaint fruit-merchant men their fruits like honey to the throat but poison in the blood men sell not such in any town would tell them how her sister stood in deadly peril to do her good and win the fiery

chorus the world 's great age begins anew the golden years return the earth doth like a snake renew her winter weeds outworn heaven smiles and faiths and empires gleam like wrecks of a dissolving dream a brighter hellas rears its mountains from waves serener far a new peneus rolls his fountains against the morning star where fairer tempes bloom there sleep young cyclads on a sunnier deep a loftier argo cleaves the main fraught with a later prize another orpheus sings again and loves and weeps and dies a new ulysses leaves once more calypso for his native shore oh write no more the tale of troy if earth death 's scroll must be nor mix with laian rage the joy which dawns upon the free although a subtler sphinx renew riddles of death thebes never knew another athens shall arise and to remoter time bequeath like sunset to the skies the splendour of its prime and leave if nought so bright may live all earth can take or heaven can give saturn and love their long repose shall burst more bright and good than all who fell than one who rose than many unsubdu 'd not gold not blood their altar dowers but votive tears and symbol flowers oh cease must hate and death return cease must men kill and die cease drain not to its dregs the urn of bitter prophecy the world is weary of the past oh might it die or rest at last
his heart is like a boat that sets forth alone on the ocean and goes far out from him as aphrodite proceeds on her pleasure journeys he pours the gold down the runnels into a great mystery under the sand when he pulls it up by the feet and knocks off the scale it is a god what is it she finds with those men that equals this dark birthing he makes each immortal manifest the deities remain invisible in their pretty gardens of grass and violets of daffodils and jasmine even his wife lives like that going on yachts speaking to the captains in the familiar let them have it the noons and rain and joy he makes a world here out of frog songs and packed earth he made his wife so she contains the green-fleshed melons of lindos thalo blue of the sea and one ripe peach at five in the morning he fashioned her by the rules with love made her with rage and disillusion

from the forests and highlands we come we come from the river-girt islands where loud waves are dumb listening to my sweet pipings the wind in the reeds and the rushes the bees on the bells of thyme the birds on the myrtle bushes the cicale above in the lime and the lizards below in the grass were as silent as ever old tmolus was listening to my sweet pipings liquid peneus was flowing and all dark tempe lay in pelion 's shadow outgrowing the light of the dying day speeded by my sweet pipings the sileni and sylvans and fauns and the nymphs of the woods and the waves to the edge of the moist river-lawns and the brink of the dewy caves and all that did then attend and follow were silent with love as you now apollo with envy of my sweet pipings i sang of the dancing stars i sang of the daedal earth and of heaven and the giant wars and love and death and birth— and then i chang 'd my pipings singing how down the vale of maenalus i pursu 'd a maiden and clasp 'd a reed gods and men we are all deluded thus it breaks in our bosom and then we bleed all wept as i think both ye now would if envy or age had not frozen your blood at the sorrow of my sweet pipings
vicisti galilæe i have lived long enough having seen one thing that love hath an end goddess and maiden and queen be near me now and befriend thou art more than the day or the morrow the seasons that laugh or that weep for these give joy and sorrow but thou proserpina sleep sweet is the treading of wine and sweet the feet of the dove but a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love yea is not even apollo with hair and harpstring of gold a bitter god to follow a beautiful god to behold i am sick of singing the bays burn deep and chafe i am fain to rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain for the gods we know not of who give us our daily breath we know they are cruel as love or life and lovely as death o gods dethroned and deceased cast forth wiped out in a day from your wrath is the world released redeemed from your chains men say new gods are crowned in the city their flowers have broken your rods they are merciful clothed with pity the young compassionate gods but for me their new device is barren the days are bare things long past over suffice and men forgotten that were time and the gods are at strife ye dwell in the midst thereof draining a little life from the barren breasts of love i say to you cease take rest yea i say to you all be at peace till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease wilt thou yet take all galilean but these thou shalt not take the laurel the palms and the pæan the breasts of the nymphs in the brake breasts more soft than a dove 's that tremble with tenderer breath and all the wings of the loves and all the joy before death all the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre dropped and deep in the flowers with strings that flicker like fire more than these wilt thou give things fairer than all these things nay for a little we live and life hath mutable wings a little while and we die shall life not thrive as it may for no man under the sky lives twice outliving his day and grief is a grievous thing and a man hath enough of his tears why should he labour and bring fresh grief to blacken his years thou hast conquered o pale galilean the world has grown grey from thy breath we have drunken of things lethean and fed on the fullness of death laurel is green for a season and love is sweet for a day but love grows bitter with treason and laurel outlives not may sleep shall we sleep after all for the world is not sweet in the end for the old faiths loosen and fall the new years ruin and rend fate is a sea without shore and the soul is a rock that abides but her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides o lips that the live blood faints in the leavings of racks and rods o ghastly glories of saints dead limbs of gibbeted gods though all men abase them before you in spirit and all knees bend i kneel not neither adore you but standing look to the end all delicate days and pleasant all spirits and sorrows are cast far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past where beyond the extreme sea-wall and between the remote sea-gates waste water washes and tall ships founder and deep death waits where mighty with deepening sides clad about with the seas as with wings and impelled of invisible tides and fulfilled of unspeakable things white-eyed and poisonous-finned shark-toothed and serpentine-curled rolls under the whitening wind of the future the wave of the world the depths stand naked in sunder behind it the storms flee away in the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey in its sides is the north-wind bound and its salt is of all men 's tears with light of ruin and sound of changes and pulse of years with travail of day after day and with trouble of hour upon hour and bitter as blood is the spray and the crests are as fangs that devour and its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be and its noise as the noise in a dream and its depth as the roots of the sea and the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air and the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble and time is made bare will ye bridle the deep sea with reins will ye chasten the high sea with rods will ye take her to chain her with chains who is older than all ye gods all ye as a wind shall go by as a fire shall ye pass and be past ye are gods and behold ye shall die and the waves be upon you at last in the darkness of time in the deeps of the years in the changes of things ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps and the world shall forget you for kings though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod though these that were gods are dead and thou being dead art a god though before thee the throned cytherean be fallen and hidden her head yet thy kingdom shall pass galilean thy dead shall go down to thee dead of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around thou art throned where another was king where another was queen she is crowned yea once we had sight of another but now she is queen say these not as thine not as thine was our mother a blossom of flowering seas clothed round with the world 's desire as with raiment and fair as the foam and fleeter than kindled fire and a goddess and mother of rome for thine came pale and a maiden and sister to sorrow but ours her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers white rose of the rose-white water a silver splendour a flame bent down unto us that besought her and earth grew sweet with her name for thine came weeping a slave among slaves and rejected but she came flushed from the full-flushed wave and imperial her foot on the sea and the wonderful waters knew her the winds and the viewless ways and the roses grew rosier and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays ye are fallen our lords by what token we wise that ye should not fall ye were all so fair that are broken and one more fair than ye all but i turn to her still having seen she shall surely abide in the end goddess and maiden and queen be near me now and befriend o daughter of earth of my mother her crown and blossom of birth i am also i also thy brother i go as i came unto earth in the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven the night where thou art where the silence is more than all tunes where sleep overflows from the heart where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world and the red rose is white and the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night and the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of gods from afar grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star in the sweet low light of thy face under heavens untrod by the sun let my soul with their souls find place and forget what is done and undone thou art more than the gods who number the days of our temporal breath let these give labour and slumber but thou proserpina death therefore now at thy feet i abide for a season in silence i know i shall die as my fathers died and sleep as they sleep even so for the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span a little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man so long i endure no longer and laugh not again neither weep for there is no god found stronger than death and death is a sleep
excerpt book i deep in the shady sadness of a vale far sunken from the healthy breath of morn far from the fiery noon and eve 's one star sat gray-hair 'd saturn quiet as a stone still as the silence round about his lair forest on forest hung about his head like cloud on cloud no stir of air was there not so much life as on a summer 's day robs not one light seed from the feather 'd grass but where the dead leaf fell there did it rest a stream went voiceless by still deadened more by reason of his fallen divinity spreading a shade the naiad 'mid her reeds press 'd her cold finger closer to her lips along the margin-sand large foot-marks went no further than to where his feet had stray 'd and slept there since upon the sodden ground his old right hand lay nerveless listless dead unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed while his bow 'd head seem 'd list'ning to the earth his ancient mother for some comfort yet it seem 'd no force could wake him from his place but there came one who with a kindred hand touch 'd his wide shoulders after bending low with reverence though to one who knew it not she was a goddess of the infant world by her in stature the tall amazon had stood a pigmy 's height she would have ta'en achilles by the hair and bent his neck or with a finger stay 'd ixion 's wheel her face was large as that of memphian sphinx pedestal 'd haply in a palace court when sages look 'd to egypt for their lore but oh how unlike marble was that face how beautiful if sorrow had not made sorrow more beautiful than beauty 's self there was a listening fear in her regard as if calamity had but begun as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up one hand she press 'd upon that aching spot where beats the human heart as if just there though an immortal she felt cruel pain the other upon saturn 's bended neck she laid and to the level of his ear leaning with parted lips some words she spake in solemn tenour and deep organ tone some mourning words which in our feeble tongue would come in these like accents o how frail to that large utterance of the early gods `` saturn look up —though wherefore poor old king i have no comfort for thee no not one i can not say `` o wherefore sleepest thou '' for heaven is parted from thee and the earth knows thee not thus afflicted for a god and ocean too with all its solemn noise has from thy sceptre pass 'd and all the air is emptied of thine hoary majesty thy thunder conscious of the new command rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house and thy sharp lightning in unpractis 'd hands scorches and burns our once serene domain o aching time o moments big as years all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth and press it so upon our weary griefs that unbelief has not a space to breathe saturn sleep on —o thoughtless why did i thus violate thy slumbrous solitude why should i ope thy melancholy eyes saturn sleep on while at thy feet i weep '' as when upon a tranced summer-night those green-rob 'd senators of mighty woods tall oaks branch-charmed by the earnest stars dream and so dream all night without a stir save from one gradual solitary gust which comes upon the silence and dies off as if the ebbing air had but one wave so came these words and went the while in tears she touch 'd her fair large forehead to the ground just where her falling hair might be outspread a soft and silken mat for saturn 's feet one moon with alteration slow had shed her silver seasons four upon the night and still these two were postured motionless like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern the frozen god still couchant on the earth and the sad goddess weeping at his feet until at length old saturn lifted up his faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone and all the gloom and sorrow of the place and that fair kneeling goddess and then spake as with a palsied tongue and while his beard shook horrid with such aspen-malady '' o tender spouse of gold hyperion thea i feel thee ere i see thy face look up and let me see our doom in it look up and tell me if this feeble shape is saturn 's tell me if thou hear'st the voice of saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow naked and bare of its great diadem peers like the front of saturn who had power to make me desolate whence came the strength how was it nurtur 'd to such bursting forth while fate seem 'd strangled in my nervous grasp but it is so and i am smother 'd up and buried from all godlike exercise of influence benign on planets pale of admonitions to the winds and seas of peaceful sway above man 's harvesting and all those acts which deity supreme doth ease its heart of love in.—i am gone away from my own bosom i have left my strong identity my real self somewhere between the throne and where i sit here on this spot of earth search thea search open thine eyes eterne and sphere them round upon all space space starr 'd and lorn of light space region 'd with life-air and barren void spaces of fire and all the yawn of hell.— search thea search and tell me if thou seest a certain shape or shadow making way with wings or chariot fierce to repossess a heaven he lost erewhile it must—it must be of ripe progress—saturn must be king yes there must be a golden victory there must be gods thrown down and trumpets blown of triumph calm and hymns of festival upon the gold clouds metropolitan voices of soft proclaim and silver stir of strings in hollow shells and there shall be beautiful things made new for the surprise of the sky-children i will give command thea thea thea where is saturn '' this passion lifted him upon his feet and made his hands to struggle in the air his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat his eyes to fever out his voice to cease he stood and heard not thea 's sobbing deep a little time and then again he snatch'd utterance thus.— '' but can not i create can not i form can not i fashion forth another world another universe to overbear and crumble this to nought where is another chaos where `` —that word found way unto olympus and made quake the rebel three.—thea was startled up and in her bearing was a sort of hope as thus she quick-voic 'd spake yet full of awe `` this cheers our fallen house come to our friends o saturn come away and give them heart i know the covert from thence came i hither '' thus brief then with beseeching eyes she went with backward footing through the shade a space he follow 'd and she turn 'd to lead the way through aged boughs that yielded like the mist which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed more sorrow like to this and such like woe too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe the titans fierce self-hid or prison-bound groan 'd for the old allegiance once more and listen 'd in sharp pain for saturn 's voice but one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept his sov'reignty and rule and majesty — blazing hyperion on his orbed fire still sat still snuff 'd the incense teeming up from man to the sun 's god yet unsecure for as among us mortals omens drear fright and perplex so also shuddered he— not at dog 's howl or gloom-bird 's hated screech or the familiar visiting of one upon the first toll of his passing bell or prophesyings of the midnight lamp but horrors portion 'd to a giant nerve oft made hyperion ache his palace bright bastion 'd with pyramids of glowing gold and touch 'd with shade of bronzed obelisks glar 'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts arches and domes and fiery galleries and all its curtains of aurorian clouds flush 'd angerly while sometimes eagle 's wings unseen before by gods or wondering men darken 'd the place and neighing steeds were heard not heard before by gods or wondering men also when he would taste the spicy wreaths of incense breath 'd aloft from sacred hills instead of sweets his ample palate took savour of poisonous brass and metal sick and so when harbour 'd in the sleepy west after the full completion of fair day — for rest divine upon exalted couch and slumber in the arms of melody he pac 'd away the pleasant hours of ease with stride colossal on from hall to hall while far within each aisle and deep recess his winged minions in close clusters stood amaz 'd and full of fear like anxious men who on wide plains gather in panting troops when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers even now while saturn rous 'd from icy trance went step for step with thea through the woods hyperion leaving twilight in the rear came slope upon the threshold of the west then as was wont his palace-door flew ope in smoothest silence save what solemn tubes blown by the serious zephyrs gave of sweet and wandering sounds slow-breathed melodies and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape in fragrance soft and coolness to the eye that inlet to severe magnificence stood full blown for the god to enter in he enter 'd but he enter 'd full of wrath his flaming robes stream 'd out beyond his heels and gave a roar as if of earthly fire that scar 'd away the meek ethereal hours and made their dove-wings tremble on he flared from stately nave to nave from vault to vault through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light and diamond-paved lustrous long arcades until he reach 'd the great main cupola there standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot and from the basements deep to the high towers jarr 'd his own golden region and before the quavering thunder thereupon had ceas 'd his voice leapt out despite of godlike curb to this result `` o dreams of day and night o monstrous forms o effigies of pain o spectres busy in a cold cold gloom o lank-ear 'd phantoms of black-weeded pools why do i know ye why have i seen ye why is my eternal essence thus distraught to see and to behold these horrors new saturn is fallen am i too to fall am i to leave this haven of my rest this cradle of my glory this soft clime this calm luxuriance of blissful light these crystalline pavilions and pure fanes of all my lucent empire it is left deserted void nor any haunt of mine the blaze the splendour and the symmetry i can not see—but darkness death and darkness even here into my centre of repose the shady visions come to domineer insult and blind and stifle up my pomp.— fall —no by tellus and her briny robes over the fiery frontier of my realms i will advance a terrible right arm shall scare that infant thunderer rebel jove and bid old saturn take his throne again `` — he spake and ceas 'd the while a heavier threat held struggle with his throat but came not forth for as in the theatres of crowded men hubbub increases more they call out `` hush '' so at hyperion 's words the phantoms pale bestirr 'd themselves thrice horrible and cold and from the mirror 'd level where he stood a mist arose as from a scummy marsh at this through all his bulk an agony crept gradual from the feet unto the crown like a lithe serpent vast and muscular making slow way with head and neck convuls'd from over-strained might releas 'd he fled to the eastern gates and full six dewy hours before the dawn in season due should blush he breath 'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals clear 'd them of heavy vapours burst them wide suddenly on the ocean 's chilly streams the planet orb of fire whereon he rode each day from east to west the heavens through spun round in sable curtaining of clouds nor therefore veiled quite blindfold and hid but ever and anon the glancing spheres circles and arcs and broad-belting colure glow 'd through and wrought upon the muffling dark sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep up to the zenith —hieroglyphics old which sages and keen-ey 'd astrologers then living on the earth with labouring thought won from the gaze of many centuries now lost save what we find on remnants huge of stone or marble swart their import gone their wisdom long since fled.—two wings this orb possess 'd for glory two fair argent wings ever exalted at the god 's approach and now from forth the gloom their plumes immense rose one by one till all outspreaded were while still the dazzling globe maintain 'd eclipse awaiting for hyperion 's command fain would he have commanded fain took throne and bid the day begin if but for change he might not —no though a primeval god the sacred seasons might not be disturb 'd therefore the operations of the dawn stay 'd in their birth even as here 't is told those silver wings expanded sisterly eager to sail their orb the porches wide open 'd upon the dusk demesnes of night and the bright titan phrenzied with new woes unus 'd to bend by hard compulsion bent his spirit to the sorrow of the time and all along a dismal rack of clouds upon the boundaries of day and night he stretch 'd himself in grief and radiance faint there as he lay the heaven with its stars look 'd down on him with pity and the voice of coelus from the universal space thus whisper 'd low and solemn in his ear `` o brightest of my children dear earth-born and sky-engendered son of mysteries all unrevealed even to the powers which met at thy creating at whose joys and palpitations sweet and pleasures soft i c oe lus wonder how they came and whence and at the fruits thereof what shapes they be distinct and visible symbols divine manifestations of that beauteous life diffus 'd unseen throughout eternal space of these new-form 'd art thou oh brightest child of these thy brethren and the goddesses there is sad feud among ye and rebellion of son against his sire i saw him fall i saw my first-born tumbled from his throne to me his arms were spread to me his voice found way from forth the thunders round his head pale wox i and in vapours hid my face art thou too near such doom vague fear there is for i have seen my sons most unlike gods divine ye were created and divine in sad demeanour solemn undisturb 'd unruffled like high gods ye liv 'd and ruled now i behold in you fear hope and wrath actions of rage and passion even as i see them on the mortal world beneath in men who die.—this is the grief o son sad sign of ruin sudden dismay and fall yet do thou strive as thou art capable as thou canst move about an evident god and canst oppose to each malignant hour ethereal presence —i am but a voice my life is but the life of winds and tides no more than winds and tides can i avail — but thou canst.—be thou therefore in the van of circumstance yea seize the arrow 's barb before the tense string murmur.—to the earth for there thou wilt find saturn and his woes meanwhile i will keep watch on thy bright sun and of thy seasons be a careful nurse `` — ere half this region-whisper had come down hyperion arose and on the stars lifted his curved lids and kept them wide until it ceas 'd and still he kept them wide and still they were the same bright patient stars then with a slow incline of his broad breast like to a diver in the pearly seas forward he stoop 'd over the airy shore and plung 'd all noiseless into the deep night
dagonet the fool whom gawain in his mood had made mock-knight of arthur 's table round at camelot high above the yellowing woods danced like a wither 'd leaf before the hall and toward him from the hall with harp in hand and from the crown thereof a carcanet of ruby swaying to and fro the prize of tristram in the jousts of yesterday came tristram saying `` why skip ye so sir fool '' for arthur and sir lancelot riding once far down beneath a winding wall of rock heard a child wail a stump of oak half-dead from roots like some black coil of carven snakes clutch 'd at the crag and started thro mid air bearing an eagle 's nest and thro the tree rush 'd ever a rainy wind and thro the wind pierced ever a child 's cry and crag and tree scaling sir lancelot from the perilous nest this ruby necklace thrice around her neck and all unscarr 'd from beak or talon brought a maiden babe which arthur pitying took then gave it to his queen to rear the queen but coldly acquiescing in her white arms received and after loved it tenderly and named it nestling so forgot herself a moment and her cares till that young life being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold past from her and in time the carcanet vext her with plaintive memories of the child so she delivering it to arthur said '' take thou the jewels of this dead innocence and make them an thou wilt a tourney-prize '' to whom the king `` peace to thine eagle-borne dead nestling and this honour after death following thy will but o my queen i muse why ye not wear on arm or neck or zone those diamonds that i rescued from the tarn and lancelot won methought for thee to wear '' `` would rather you had let them fall '' she cried '' plunge and be lost—ill-fated as they were a bitterness to me —ye look amazed not knowing they were lost as soon as given— slid from my hands when i was leaning out above the river—that unhappy child past in her barge but rosier luck will go with these rich jewels seeing that they came not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer but the sweet body of a maiden babe perchance—who knows —the purest of thy knights may win them for the purest of my maids '' she ended and the cry of a great jousts with trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways from camelot in among the faded fields to furthest towers and everywhere the knights arm 'd for a day of glory before the king but on the hither side of that loud morn into the hall stagger 'd his visage ribb'd from ear to ear with dogwhip-weals his nose bridge-broken one eye out and one hand off and one with shatter 'd fingers dangling lame a churl to whom indignantly the king `` my churl for whom christ died what evil beast hath drawn his claws athwart thy face or fiend man was it who marr 'd heaven 's image in thee thus '' then sputtering thro the hedge of splinter 'd teeth yet strangers to the tongue and with blunt stump pitch-blacken 'd sawing the air said the maim 'd churl `` he took them and he drave them to his tower— some hold he was a table-knight of thine— a hundred goodly ones—the red knight he— lord i was tending swine and the red knight brake in upon me and drave them to his tower and when i call 'd upon thy name as one that doest right by gentle and by churl maim 'd me and maul 'd and would outright have slain save that he sware me to a message saying 'tell thou the king and all his liars that i have founded my round table in the north and whatsoever his own knights have sworn my knights have sworn the counter to it—and say my tower is full of harlots like his court but mine are worthier seeing they profess to be none other than themselves—and say my knights are all adulterers like his own but mine are truer seeing they profess to be none other and say his hour is come the heathen are upon him his long lance broken and his excalibur a straw `` then arthur turn 'd to kay the seneschal '' take thou my churl and tend him curiously like a king 's heir till all his hurts be whole the heathen—but that ever-climbing wave hurl 'd back again so often in empty foam hath lain for years at rest—and renegades thieves bandits leavings of confusion whom the wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere friends thro your manhood and your fealty —now make their last head like satan in the north my younger knights new-made in whom your flower waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds move with me toward their quelling which achieved the loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore but thou sir lancelot sitting in my place enchair 'd to-morrow arbitrate the field for wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it only to yield my queen her own again speak lancelot thou art silent is it well '' thereto sir lancelot answer 'd `` it is well yet better if the king abide and leave the leading of his younger knights to me else for the king has will 'd it it is well '' then arthur rose and lancelot follow 'd him and while they stood without the doors the king turn 'd to him saying `` is it then so well or mine the blame that oft i seem as he of whom was written 'a sound is in his ears the foot that loiters bidden go —the glance that only seems half-loyal to command — a manner somewhat fall'n from reverence— or have i dream 'd the bearing of our knights tells of a manhood ever less and lower or whence the fear lest this my realm uprear 'd by noble deeds at one with noble vows from flat confusion and brute violences reel back into the beast and be no more '' he spoke and taking all his younger knights down the slope city rode and sharply turn'd north by the gate in her high bower the queen working a tapestry lifted up her head watch 'd her lord pass and knew not that she sigh 'd then ran across her memory the strange rhyme of bygone merlin `` where is he who knows from the great deep to the great deep he goes '' but when the morning of a tournament by these in earnest those in mockery call'd the tournament of the dead innocence brake with a wet wind blowing lancelot round whose sick head all night like birds of prey the words of arthur flying shriek 'd arose and down a streetway hung with folds of pure white samite and by fountains running wine where children sat in white with cups of gold moved to the lists and there with slow sad steps ascending fill 'd his double-dragon 'd chair he glanced and saw the stately galleries dame damsel each thro worship of their queen white-robed in honour of the stainless child and some with scatter 'd jewels like a bank of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire he look 'd but once and vail 'd his eyes again the sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream to ears but half-awaked then one low roll of autumn thunder and the jousts began and ever the wind blew and yellowing leaf and gloom and gleam and shower and shorn plume went down it sighing weariedly as one who sits and gazes on a faded fire when all the goodlier guests are past away sat their great umpire looking o'er the lists he saw the laws that ruled the tournament broken but spake not once a knight cast down before his throne of arbitration cursed the dead babe and the follies of the king and once the laces of a helmet crack 'd and show 'd him like a vermin in its hole modred a narrow face anon he heard the voice that billow 'd round the barriers roar an ocean-sounding welcome to one knight but newly-enter 'd taller than the rest and armour 'd all in forest green whereon there tript a hundred tiny silver deer and wearing but a holly-spray for crest with ever-scattering berries and on shield a spear a harp a bugle—tristram—late from overseas in brittany return 'd and marriage with a princess of that realm isolt the white—sir tristram of the woods— whom lancelot knew had held sometime with pain his own against him and now yearn 'd to shake the burthen off his heart in one full shock with tristram ev'n to death his strong hands gript and dinted the gilt dragons right and left until he groan 'd for wrath—so many of those that ware their ladies colours on the casque drew from before sir tristram to the bounds and there with gibes and flickering mockeries stood while he mutter 'd `` craven crests o shame what faith have these in whom they sware to love the glory of our round table is no more '' so tristram won and lancelot gave the gems not speaking other word than `` hast thou won art thou the purest brother see the hand wherewith thou takest this is red '' to whom tristram half plagued by lancelot 's languorous mood made answer `` ay but wherefore toss me this like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound let be thy fair queen 's fantasy strength of heart and might of limb but mainly use and skill are winners in this pastime of our king my hand—belike the lance hath dript upon it— no blood of mine i trow but o chief knight right arm of arthur in the battlefield great brother thou nor i have made the world be happy in thy fair queen as i in mine '' and tristram round the gallery made his horse caracole then bow 'd his homage bluntly saying '' fair damsels each to him who worships each sole queen of beauty and of love behold this day my queen of beauty is not here '' and most of these were mute some anger 'd one murmuring `` all courtesy is dead '' and one '' the glory of our round table is no more '' then fell thick rain plume droopt and mantle clung and pettish cries awoke and the wan day went glooming down in wet and weariness but under her black brows a swarthy one laugh 'd shrilly crying `` praise the patient saints our one white day of innocence hath past tho somewhat draggled at the skirt so be it the snowdrop only flowering thro the year would make the world as blank as winter-tide come—let us gladden their sad eyes our queen's and lancelot 's at this night 's solemnity with all the kindlier colours of the field '' so dame and damsel glitter 'd at the feast variously gay for he that tells the tale liken 'd them saying as when an hour of cold falls on the mountain in midsummer snows and all the purple slopes of mountain flowers pass under white till the warm hour returns with veer of wind and all are flowers again so dame and damsel cast the simple white and glowing in all colours the live grass rose-campion bluebell kingcup poppy glanced about the revels and with mirth so loud beyond all use that half-amazed the queen and wroth at tristram and the lawless jousts brake up their sports then slowly to her bower parted and in her bosom pain was lord and little dagonet on the morrow morn high over all the yellowing autumn-tide danced like a wither 'd leaf before the hall then tristram saying `` why skip ye so sir fool '' wheel 'd round on either heel dagonet replied '' belike for lack of wiser company or being fool and seeing too much wit makes the world rotten why belike i skip to know myself the wisest knight of all '' `` ay fool '' said tristram `` but 't is eating dry to dance without a catch a roundelay to dance to '' then he twangled on his harp and while he twangled little dagonet stood quiet as any water-sodden log stay 'd in the wandering warble of a brook but when the twangling ended skipt again and being ask 'd `` why skipt ye not sir fool '' made answer `` i had liefer twenty years skip to the broken music of my brains than any broken music thou canst make '' then tristram waiting for the quip to come '' good now what music have i broken fool '' and little dagonet skipping `` arthur the king 's for when thou playest that air with queen isolt thou makest broken music with thy bride her daintier namesake down in brittany— and so thou breakest arthur 's music too '' `` save for that broken music in thy brains sir fool '' said tristram `` i would break thy head fool i came late the heathen wars were o'er the life had flown we sware but by the shell— i am but a fool to reason with a fool— come thou art crabb 'd and sour but lean me down sir dagonet one of thy long asses ears and harken if my music be not true `` 'free love—free field—we love but while we may the woods are hush 'd their music is no more the leaf is dead the yearning past away new leaf new life—the days of frost are o'er new life new love to suit the newer day new loves are sweet as those that went before free love—free field—we love but while we may `` ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune not stood stockstill i made it in the woods and heard it ring as true as tested gold '' but dagonet with one foot poised in his hand '' friend did ye mark that fountain yesterday made to run wine —but this had run itself all out like a long life to a sour end— and them that round it sat with golden cups to hand the wine to whosoever came— the twelve small damosels white as innocence in honour of poor innocence the babe who left the gems which innocence the queen lent to the king and innocence the king gave for a prize—and one of those white slips handed her cup and piped the pretty one 'drink drink sir fool and thereupon i drank spat—pish—the cup was gold the draught was mud '' and tristram `` was it muddier than thy gibes is all the laughter gone dead out of thee — not marking how the knighthood mock thee fool— 'fear god honour the king—his one true knight— sole follower of the vows'—for here be they who knew thee swine enow before i came smuttier than blasted grain but when the king had made thee fool thy vanity so shot up it frighted all free fool from out thy heart which left thee less than fool and less than swine a naked aught—yet swine i hold thee still for i have flung thee pearls and find thee swine '' and little dagonet mincing with his feet '' knight an ye fling those rubies round my neck in lieu of hers i 'll hold thou hast some touch of music since i care not for thy pearls swine i have wallow 'd i have wash'd—the world is flesh and shadow—i have had my day the dirty nurse experience in her kind hath foul 'd me—an i wallow 'd then i wash'd— i have had my day and my philosophies— and thank the lord i am king arthur 's fool swine say ye swine goats asses rams and geese troop 'd round a paynim harper once who thrumm'd on such a wire as musically as thou some such fine song—but never a king 's fool '' and tristram `` then were swine goats asses geese the wiser fools seeing thy paynim bard had such a mastery of his mystery that he could harp his wife up out of hell '' then dagonet turning on the ball of his foot '' and whither harp'st thou thine down and thyself down and two more a helpful harper thou that harpest downward dost thou know the star we call the harp of arthur up in heaven '' and tristram `` ay sir fool for when our king was victor wellnigh day by day the knights glorying in each new glory set his name high on all hills and in the signs of heaven '' and dagonet answer 'd `` ay and when the land was freed and the queen false ye set yourself to babble about him all to show your wit— and whether he were king by courtesy or king by right—and so went harping down the black king 's highway got so far and grew so witty that we play 'd at ducks and drakes with arthur 's vows on the great lake of fire tuwhoo do ye see it do ye see the star '' `` nay fool '' said tristram `` not in open day '' and dagonet `` nay nor will i see it and hear it makes a silent music up in heaven and i and arthur and the angels hear and then we skip '' `` lo fool '' he said `` ye talk fool 's treason is the king thy brother fool '' then little dagonet clapt his hands and shrill 'd '' ay ay my brother fool the king of fools conceits himself as god that he can make figs out of thistles silk from bristles milk from burning spurge honey from hornet-combs and men from beasts—long live the king of fools '' and down the city dagonet danced away but thro the slowly-mellowing avenues and solitary passes of the wood rode tristram toward lyonnesse and the west before him fled the face of queen isolt with ruby-circled neck but evermore past as a rustle or twitter in the wood made dull his inner keen his outer eye for all that walk 'd or crept or perch 'd or flew anon the face as when a gust hath blown unruffling waters re-collect the shape of one that in them sees himself return 'd but at the slot or fewmets of a deer or ev'n a fall'n feather vanish 'd again so on for all that day from lawn to lawn thro many a league-long bower he rode at length a lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs furze-cramm 'd and bracken-rooft the which himself built for a summer day with queen isolt against a shower dark in the golden grove appearing sent his fancy back to where she lived a moon in that low lodge with him till mark her lord had past the cornish king with six or seven when tristram was away and snatch 'd her thence yet dreading worse than shame her warrior tristram spake not any word but bode his hour devising wretchedness and now that desert lodge to tristram lookt so sweet that halting in he past and sank down on a drift of foliage random-blown but could not rest for musing how to smoothe and sleek his marriage over to the queen perchance in lone tintagil far from all the tonguesters of the court she had not heard but then what folly had sent him overseas after she left him lonely here a name was it the name of one in brittany isolt the daughter of the king `` isolt of the white hands '' they call 'd her the sweet name allured him first and then the maid herself who served him well with those white hands of hers and loved him well until himself had thought he loved her also wedded easily but left her all as easily and return 'd the black-blue irish hair and irish eyes had drawn him home—what marvel then he laid his brows upon the drifted leaf and dream 'd he seem 'd to pace the strand of brittany between isolt of britain and his bride and show 'd them both the ruby-chain and both began to struggle for it till his queen graspt it so hard that all her hand was red then cried the breton `` look her hand is red these be no rubies this is frozen blood and melts within her hand—her hand is hot with ill desires but this i gave thee look is all as cool and white as any flower '' follow 'd a rush of eagle 's wings and then a whimpering of the spirit of the child because the twain had spoil 'd her carcanet he dream 'd but arthur with a hundred spears rode far till o'er the illimitable reed and many a glancing plash and sallowy isle the wide-wing 'd sunset of the misty marsh glared on a huge machicolated tower that stood with open doors whereout was roll'd a roar of riot as from men secure amid their marshes ruffians at their ease among their harlot-brides an evil song `` lo there '' said one of arthur 's youth for there high on a grim dead tree before the tower a goodly brother of the table round swung by the neck and on the boughs a shield showing a shower of blood in a field noir and therebeside a horn inflamed the knights at that dishonour done the gilded spur till each would clash the shield and blow the horn but arthur waved them back alone he rode then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn that sent the face of all the marsh aloft an ever upward-rushing storm and cloud of shriek and plume the red knight heard and all even to tipmost lance and topmost helm in blood-red armour sallying howl 'd to the king `` the teeth of hell flay bare and gnash thee flat — lo art thou not that eunuch-hearted king who fain had clipt free manhood from the world— the woman-worshipper yea god 's curse and i slain was the brother of my paramour by a knight of thine and i that heard her whine and snivel being eunuch-hearted too sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell and stings itself to everlasting death to hang whatever knight of thine i fought and tumbled art thou king —look to thy life '' he ended arthur knew the voice the face wellnigh was helmet-hidden and the name went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind and arthur deign 'd not use of word or sword but let the drunkard as he stretch 'd from horse to strike him overbalancing his bulk down from the causeway heavily to the swamp fall as the crest of some slow-arching wave heard in dead night along that table-shore drops flat and after the great waters break whitening for half a league and thin themselves far over sands marbled with moon and cloud from less and less to nothing thus he fell head-heavy then the knights who watch 'd him roar'd and shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n there trampled out his face from being known and sank his head in mire and slimed themselves nor heard the king for their own cries but sprang thro open doors and swording right and left men women on their sodden faces hurl'd the tables over and the wines and slew till all the rafters rang with woman-yells and all the pavement stream 'd with massacre then echoing yell with yell they fired the tower which half that autumn night like the live north red-pulsing up thro alioth and alcor made all above it and a hundred meres about it as the water moab saw come round by the east and out beyond them flush'd the long low dune and lazy-plunging sea so all the ways were safe from shore to shore but in the heart of arthur pain was lord then out of tristram waking the red dream fled with a shout and that low lodge return 'd mid-forest and the wind among the boughs he whistled his good warhorse left to graze among the forest greens vaulted upon him and rode beneath an ever-showering leaf till one lone woman weeping near a cross stay 'd him `` why weep ye '' `` lord '' she said `` my man hath left me or is dead '' whereon he thought— '' what if she hate me now i would not this what if she love me still i would not that i know not what i would '' —but said to her '' yet weep not thou lest if thy mate return he find thy favour changed and love thee not '' — then pressing day by day thro lyonnesse last in a roky hollow belling heard the hounds of mark and felt the goodly hounds yelp at his heart but turning past and gain'd tintagil half in sea and high on land a crown of towers down in a casement sat a low sea-sunset glorying round her hair and glossy-throated grace isolt the queen and when she heard the feet of tristram grind the spiring stone that scaled about her tower flush 'd started met him at the doors and there belted his body with her white embrace crying aloud `` not mark—not mark my soul the footstep flutter 'd me at first not he catlike thro his own castle steals my mark but warrior-wise thou stridest thro his halls who hates thee as i him—ev'n to the death my soul i felt my hatred for my mark quicken within me and knew that thou wert nigh '' to whom sir tristram smiling `` i am here let be thy mark seeing he is not thine '' and drawing somewhat backward she replied '' can he be wrong 'd who is not ev'n his own but save for dread of thee had beaten me scratch 'd bitten blinded marr 'd me somehow—mark what rights are his that dare not strike for them not lift a hand—not tho he found me thus but harken have ye met him hence he went to-day for three days hunting—as he said— and so returns belike within an hour mark 's way my soul —but eat not thou with mark because he hates thee even more than fears nor drink and when thou passest any wood close vizor lest an arrow from the bush should leave me all alone with mark and hell my god the measure of my hate for mark is as the measure of my love for thee '' so pluck 'd one way by hate and one by love drain 'd of her force again she sat and spake to tristram as he knelt before her saying '' o hunter and o blower of the horn harper and thou hast been a rover too for ere i mated with my shambling king ye twain had fallen out about the bride of one—his name is out of me—the prize if prize she were— what marvel—she could see — thine friend and ever since my craven seeks to wreck thee villainously but o sir knight what dame or damsel have ye kneel 'd to last '' and tristram `` last to my queen paramount here now to my queen paramount of love and loveliness—ay lovelier than when first her light feet fell on our rough lyonnesse sailing from ireland '' softly laugh 'd isolt '' flatter me not for hath not our great queen my dole of beauty trebled '' and he said '' her beauty is her beauty and thine thine and thine is more to me—soft gracious kind— save when thy mark is kindled on thy lips most gracious but she haughty ev'n to him lancelot for i have seen him wan enow to make one doubt if ever the great queen have yielded him her love '' to whom isolt '' ah then false hunter and false harper thou who brakest thro the scruple of my bond calling me thy white hind and saying to me that guinevere had sinn 'd against the highest and i—misyoked with such a want of man— that i could hardly sin against the lowest '' he answer 'd `` o my soul be comforted if this be sweet to sin in leading-strings if here be comfort and if ours be sin crown 'd warrant had we for the crowning sin that made us happy but how ye greet me—fear and fault and doubt—no word of that fond tale— thy deep heart-yearnings thy sweet memories of tristram in that year he was away '' and saddening on the sudden spake isolt '' i had forgotten all in my strong joy to see thee—yearnings —ay for hour by hour here in the never-ended afternoon o sweeter than all memories of thee deeper than any yearnings after thee seem 'd those far-rolling westward-smiling seas watch 'd from this tower isolt of britain dash'd before isolt of brittany on the strand would that have chill 'd her bride-kiss wedded her fought in her father 's battles wounded there the king was all fulfill 'd with gratefulness and she my namesake of the hands that heal'd thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress— well—can i wish her any huger wrong than having known thee her too hast thou left to pine and waste in those sweet memories o were i not my mark 's by whom all men are noble i should hate thee more than love '' and tristram fondling her light hands replied '' grace queen for being loved she loved me well did i love her the name at least i loved isolt —i fought his battles for isolt the night was dark the true star set isolt the name was ruler of the dark—isolt care not for her patient and prayerful meek pale-blooded she will yield herself to god '' and isolt answer 'd `` yea and why not i mine is the larger need who am not meek pale-blooded prayerful let me tell thee now here one black mute midsummer night i sat lonely but musing on thee wondering where murmuring a light song i had heard thee sing and once or twice i spake thy name aloud then flash 'd a levin-brand and near me stood in fuming sulphur blue and green a fiend— mark 's way to steal behind one in the dark— for there was mark 'he has wedded her he said not said but hiss 'd it then this crown of towers so shook to such a roar of all the sky that here in utter dark i swoon 'd away and woke again in utter dark and cried 'i will flee hence and give myself to god'— and thou wert lying in thy new leman 's arms '' then tristram ever dallying with her hand '' may god be with thee sweet when old and gray and past desire '' a saying that anger 'd her `` 'may god be with thee sweet when thou art old and sweet no more to me i need him now for when had lancelot utter 'd aught so gross ev'n to the swineherd 's malkin in the mast the greater man the greater courtesy far other was the tristram arthur 's knight but thou thro ever harrying thy wild beasts— save that to touch a harp tilt with a lance becomes thee well—art grown wild beast thyself how darest thou if lover push me even in fancy from thy side and set me far in the gray distance half a life away her to be loved no more unsay it unswear flatter me rather seeing me so weak broken with mark and hate and solitude thy marriage and mine own that i should suck lies like sweet wines lie to me i believe will ye not lie not swear as there ye kneel and solemnly as when ye sware to him the man of men our king—my god the power was once in vows when men believed the king they lied not then who sware and thro their vows the king prevailing made his realm —i say swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old gray-hair 'd and past desire and in despair '' then tristram pacing moodily up and down '' vows did you keep the vow you made to mark more than i mine lied say ye nay but learnt the vow that binds too strictly snaps itself— my knighthood taught me this—ay being snapt— we run more counter to the soul thereof than had we never sworn i swear no more i swore to the great king and am forsworn for once—ev'n to the height—i honour 'd him 'man is he man at all methought when first i rode from our rough lyonnesse and beheld that victor of the pagan throned in hall— his hair a sun that ray 'd from off a brow like hillsnow high in heaven the steel-blue eyes the golden beard that clothed his lips with light— moreover that weird legend of his birth with merlin 's mystic babble about his end amazed me then his foot was on a stool shaped as a dragon he seem 'd to me no man but michaël trampling satan so i sware being amazed but this went by—the vows o ay—the wholesome madness of an hour— they served their use their time for every knight believed himself a greater than himself and every follower eyed him as a god till he being lifted up beyond himself did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done and so the realm was made but then their vows— first mainly thro that sullying of our queen— began to gall the knighthood asking whence had arthur right to bind them to himself dropt down from heaven wash 'd up from out the deep they fail 'd to trace him thro the flesh and blood of our old kings whence then a doubtful lord to bind them by inviolable vows which flesh and blood perforce would violate for feel this arm of mine—the tide within red with free chase and heather-scented air pulsing full man can arthur make me pure as any maiden child lock up my tongue from uttering freely what i freely hear bind me to one the wide world laughs at it and worldling of the world am i and know the ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour woos his own end we are not angels here nor shall be vows—i am woodman of the woods and hear the garnet-headed yaffingale mock them my soul we love but while we may and therefore is my love so large for thee seeing it is not bounded save by love '' here ending he moved toward her and she said '' good an i turn 'd away my love for thee to some one thrice as courteous as thyself— for courtesy wins woman all as well as valour may but he that closes both is perfect he is lancelot—taller indeed rosier and comelier thou—but say i loved this knightliest of all knights and cast thee back thine own small saw 'we love but while we may well then what answer '' he that while she spake mindful of what he brought to adorn her with the jewels had let one finger lightly touch the warm white apple of her throat replied '' press this a little closer sweet until— come i am hunger 'd and half-anger'd—meat wine wine—and i will love thee to the death and out beyond into the dream to come '' so then when both were brought to full accord she rose and set before him all he will 'd and after these had comforted the blood with meats and wines and satiated their hearts— now talking of their woodland paradise the deer the dews the fern the founts the lawns now mocking at the much ungainliness and craven shifts and long crane legs of mark— then tristram laughing caught the harp and sang `` ay ay o ay—the winds that bend the brier a star in heaven a star within the mere ay ay o ay—a star was my desire and one was far apart and one was near ay ay o ay—the winds that bow the grass and one was water and one star was fire and one will ever shine and one will pass ay ay o ay—the winds that move the mere '' then in the light 's last glimmer tristram show'd and swung the ruby carcanet she cried '' the collar of some order which our king hath newly founded all for thee my soul for thee to yield thee grace beyond thy peers '' `` not so my queen '' he said `` but the red fruit grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven and won by tristram as a tourney-prize and hither brought by tristram for his last love-offering and peace-offering unto thee '' he spoke he turn 'd then flinging round her neck claspt it and cried `` thine order o my queen '' but while he bow 'd to kiss the jewell 'd throat out of the dark just as the lips had touch 'd behind him rose a shadow and a shriek— '' mark 's way '' said mark and clove him thro the brain that night came arthur home and while he climb 'd all in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom the stairway to the hall and look 'd and saw the great queen 's bower was dark —about his feet a voice clung sobbing till he question 'd it '' what art thou '' and the voice about his feet sent up an answer sobbing `` i am thy fool and i shall never make thee smile again ''
that story which the bold sir bedivere first made and latest left of all the knights told when the man was no more than a voice in the white winter of his age to those with whom he dwelt new faces other minds for on their march to westward bedivere who slowly paced among the slumbering host heard in his tent the moanings of the king `` i found him in the shining of the stars i mark 'd him in the flowering of his fields but in his ways with men i find him not i waged his wars and now i pass and die o me for why is all around us here as if some lesser god had made the world but had not force to shape it as he would till the high god behold it from beyond and enter it and make it beautiful or else as if the world were wholly fair but that these eyes of men are dense and dim and have not power to see it as it is perchance because we see not to the close — for i being simple thought to work his will and have but stricken with the sword in vain and all whereon i lean 'd in wife and friend is traitor to my peace and all my realm reels back into the beast and is no more my god thou hast forgotten me in my death nay—god my christ—i pass but shall not die '' then ere that last weird battle in the west there came on arthur sleeping gawain kill'd in lancelot 's war the ghost of gawain blown along a wandering wind and past his ear went shrilling `` hollow hollow all delight hail king to-morrow thou shalt pass away farewell there is an isle of rest for thee and i am blown along a wandering wind and hollow hollow hollow all delight '' and fainter onward like wild birds that change their season in the night and wail their way from cloud to cloud down the long wind the dream shrill 'd but in going mingled with dim cries far in the moonlit haze among the hills as of some lonely city sack 'd by night when all is lost and wife and child with wail pass to new lords and arthur woke and call 'd '' who spake a dream o light upon the wind thine gawain was the voice—are these dim cries thine or doth all that haunts the waste and wild mourn knowing it will go along with me '' this heard the bold sir bedivere and spake '' o me my king let pass whatever will elves and the harmless glamour of the field but in their stead thy name and glory cling to all high places like a golden cloud for ever but as yet thou shalt not pass light was gawain in life and light in death is gawain for the ghost is as the man and care not thou for dreams from him but rise— i hear the steps of modred in the west and with him many of thy people and knights once thine whom thou hast loved but grosser grown than heathen spitting at their vows and thee right well in heart they know thee for the king arise go forth and conquer as of old '' then spake king arthur to sir bedivere '' far other is this battle in the west whereto we move than when we strove in youth and brake the petty kings and fought with rome or thrust the heathen from the roman wall and shook him thro the north ill doom is mine to war against my people and my knights the king who fights his people fights himself and they my knights who loved me once the stroke that strikes them dead is as my death to me yet let us hence and find or feel a way thro this blind haze which ever since i saw one lying in the dust at almesbury hath folded in the passes of the world '' then rose the king and moved his host by night and ever push 'd sir modred league by league back to the sunset bound of lyonnesse— a land of old upheaven from the abyss by fire to sink into the abyss again where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt and the long mountains ended in a coast of ever-shifting sand and far away the phantom circle of a moaning sea there the pursuer could pursue no more and he that fled no further fly the king and there that day when the great light of heaven burn 'd at his lowest in the rolling year on the waste sand by the waste sea they closed nor ever yet had arthur fought a fight like this last dim weird battle of the west a deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea whereof the chill to him who breathed it drew down with his blood till all his heart was cold with formless fear and ev'n on arthur fell confusion since he saw not whom he fought for friend and foe were shadows in the mist and friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew and some had visions out of golden youth and some beheld the faces of old ghosts look in upon the battle and in the mist was many a noble deed many a base and chance and craft and strength in single fights and ever and anon with host to host shocks and the splintering spear the hard mail hewn shield-breakings and the clash of brands the crash of battleaxes on shatter 'd helms and shrieks after the christ of those who falling down look 'd up for heaven and only saw the mist and shouts of heathen and the traitor knights oaths insult filth and monstrous blasphemies sweat writhings anguish labouring of the lungs in that close mist and cryings for the light moans of the dying and voices of the dead last as by some one deathbed after wail of suffering silence follows or thro death or deathlike swoon thus over all that shore save for some whisper of the seething seas a dead hush fell but when the dolorous day grew drearier toward twilight falling came a bitter wind clear from the north and blew the mist aside and with that wind the tide rose and the pale king glanced across the field of battle but no man was moving there nor any cry of christian heard thereon nor yet of heathen only the wan wave brake in among dead faces to and fro swaying the helpless hands and up and down tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen and shiver 'd brands that once had fought with rome and rolling far along the gloomy shores the voice of days of old and days to be then spake king arthur to sir bedivere and whiter than the mist that all day long had held the field of battle was the king `` hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world and wastes the narrow realm whereon we move and beats upon the faces of the dead my dead as tho they had not died for me — o bedivere for on my heart hath fall'n confusion till i know not what i am nor whence i am nor whether i be king behold i seem but king among the dead '' then spake the bold sir bedivere `` my king king everywhere and so the dead have kings there also will i worship thee as king yet still thy life is whole and still i live who love thee but who hates thee he that brought the heathen back among us yonder stands modred unharm 'd the traitor of thine house '' then spake the king `` my house hath been my doom but call not thou this traitor of my house who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me my house are rather they who sware my vows yea even while they brake them own 'd me king and well for thee saying in my dark hour when all the purport of my throne hath fail 'd that quick or dead thou hottest me for king king am i whatsoever be their cry and one last act of kinghood shalt thou see yet ere i pass '' and uttering this the king made at the man then modred smote his liege hard on that helm which many a heathen sword had beaten thin while arthur at one blow striking the last stroke with excalibur slew him and all but slain himself he fell so all day long the noise of battle roll'd among the mountains by the winter sea until king arthur 's table man by man had fall'n in lyonnesse about their lord king arthur then because his wound was deep the bold sir bedivere uplifted him and bore him to a chapel nigh the field a broken chancel with a broken cross that stood on a dark strait of barren land on one side lay the ocean and on one lay a great water and the moon was full then spake king arthur to sir bedivere '' the sequel of to-day unsolders all the goodliest fellowship of famous knights whereof this world holds record such a sleep they sleep—the men i loved i think that we shall never more at any future time delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds walking about the gardens and the halls of camelot as in the days that were i perish by this people which i made — tho merlin sware that i should come again to rule once more but let what will be be i am so deeply smitten thro the helm that without help i can not last till morn thou therefore take my brand excalibur which was my pride for thou rememberest how in those old days one summer noon an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake clothed in white samite mystic wonderful holding the sword—and how i row 'd across and took it and have worn it like a king and wheresoever i am sung or told in aftertime this also shall be known but now delay not take excalibur and fling him far into the middle mere watch what thou seëst and lightly bring me word '' to him replied the bold sir bedivere '' it is not meet sir king to leave thee thus aidless alone and smitten thro the helm— a little thing may harm a wounded man yet i thy hest will all perform at full watch what i see and lightly bring thee word '' so saying from the ruin 'd shrine he stept and in the moon athwart the place of tombs where lay the mighty bones of ancient men old knights and over them the sea-wind sang shrill chill with flakes of foam he stepping down by zigzag paths and juts of pointed rock came on the shining levels of the lake there drew he forth the brand excalibur and o'er him drawing it the winter moon brightening the skirts of a long cloud ran forth and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks myriads of topaz-lights and jacinth-work of subtlest jewellery he gazed so long that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood this way and that dividing the swift mind in act to throw but at the last it seem'd better to leave excalibur conceal'd there in the many-knotted waterflags that whistled stiff and dry about the marge so strode he back slow to the wounded king then spake king arthur to sir bedivere '' hast thou perform 'd my mission which i gave what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard '' and answer made the bold sir bedivere '' i heard the ripple washing in the reeds and the wild water lapping on the crag '' to whom replied king arthur faint and pale '' thou hast betray 'd thy nature and thy name not rendering true answer as beseem'd thy fealty nor like a noble knight for surer sign had follow 'd either hand or voice or else a motion of the mere this is a shameful thing for men to lie yet now i charge thee quickly go again as thou art lief and dear and do the thing i bade thee watch and lightly bring me word '' then went sir bedivere the second time across the ridge and paced beside the mere counting the dewy pebbles fix 'd in thought but when he saw the wonder of the hilt how curiously and strangely chased he smote his palms together and he cried aloud `` and if indeed i cast the brand away surely a precious thing one worthy note should thus be lost for ever from the earth which might have pleased the eyes of many men what good should follow this if this were done what harm undone deep harm to disobey seeing obedience is the bond of rule were it well to obey then if a king demand an act unprofitable against himself the king is sick and knows not what he does what record or what relic of my lord should be to aftertime but empty breath and rumours of a doubt but were this kept stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings some one might show it at a joust of arms saying 'king arthur 's sword excalibur wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills so might some old man speak in the aftertime to all the people winning reverence but now much honour and much fame were lost '' so spake he clouded with his own conceit and hid excalibur the second time and so strode back slow to the wounded king then spoke king arthur breathing heavily '' what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard and answer made the bold sir bedivere '' i heard the water lapping on the crag and the long ripple washing in the reeds '' to whom replied king arthur much in wrath '' ah miserable and unkind untrue unknightly traitor-hearted woe is me authority forgets a dying king laid widow 'd of the power in his eye that bow 'd the will i see thee what thou art for thou the latest-left of all my knights in whom should meet the offices of all thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt either from lust of gold or like a girl valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes yet for a man may fail in duty twice and the third time may prosper get thee hence but if thou spare to fling excalibur i will arise and slay thee with my hands '' then quickly rose sir bedivere and ran and leaping down the ridges lightly plunged among the bulrush beds and clutch 'd the sword and strongly wheel 'd and threw it the great brand made lightnings in the splendour of the moon and flashing round and round and whirl 'd in an arch shot like a streamer of the northern morn seen where the moving isles of winter shock by night with noises of the northern sea so flash 'd and fell the brand excalibur but ere he dipt the surface rose an arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful and caught him by the hilt and brandish 'd him three times and drew him under in the mere and lightly went the other to the king then spoke king arthur drawing thicker breath '' now see i by thine eyes that this is done speak out what is it thou hast heard or seen '' and answer made the bold sir bedivere '' sir king i closed mine eyelids lest the gems should blind my purpose for i never saw nor shall see here or elsewhere till i die not tho i live three lives of mortal men so great a miracle as yonder hilt then with both hands i flung him wheeling him but when i look 'd again behold an arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful that caught him by the hilt and brandish 'd him three times and drew him under in the mere '' and answer made king arthur breathing hard '' my end draws nigh 't is time that i were gone make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight and bear me to the margin yet i fear my wound hath taken cold and i shall die '' so saying from the pavement he half rose slowly with pain reclining on his arm and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture him sir bedivere remorsefully regarded thro his tears and would have spoken but he found not words then took with care and kneeling on one knee o'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands and rising bore him thro the place of tombs but as he walk 'd king arthur panted hard like one that feels a nightmare on his bed when all the house is mute so sigh 'd the king muttering and murmuring at his ear `` quick quick i fear it is too late and i shall die '' but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge clothed with his breath and looking as he walk 'd larger than human on the frozen hills he heard the deep behind him and a cry before his own thought drove him like a goad dry clash 'd his harness in the icy caves and barren chasms and all to left and right the bare black cliff clang 'd round him as he based his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— and on a sudden lo the level lake and the long glories of the winter moon then saw they how there hove a dusky barge dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern beneath them and descending they were ware that all the decks were dense with stately forms black-stoled black-hooded like a dream—by these three queens with crowns of gold and from them rose a cry that shiver 'd to the tingling stars and as it were one voice an agony of lamentation like a wind that shrills all night in a waste land where no one comes or hath come since the making of the world then murmur 'd arthur `` place me in the barge '' so to the barge they came there those three queens put forth their hands and took the king and wept but she that rose the tallest of them all and fairest laid his head upon her lap and loosed the shatter 'd casque and chafed his hands and call 'd him by his name complaining loud and dropping bitter tears against a brow striped with dark blood for all his face was white and colourless and like the wither 'd moon smote by the fresh beam of the springing east and all his greaves and cuisses dash 'd with drops of onset and the light and lustrous curls— that made his forehead like a rising sun high from the daïs-throne—were parch 'd with dust or clotted into points and hanging loose mix 'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips so like a shatter 'd column lay the king not like that arthur who with lance in rest from spur to plume a star of tournament shot thro the lists at camelot and charged before the eyes of ladies and of kings then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere '' ah my lord arthur whither shall i go where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes for now i see the true old times are dead when every morning brought a noble chance and every chance brought out a noble knight such times have been not since the light that led the holy elders with the gift of myrrh but now the whole round table is dissolved which was an image of the mighty world and i the last go forth companionless and the days darken round me and the years among new men strange faces other minds '' and slowly answer 'd arthur from the barge '' the old order changeth yielding place to new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world comfort thyself what comfort is in me i have lived my life and that which i have done may he within himself make pure but thou if thou shouldst never see my face again pray for my soul more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of wherefore let thy voice rise like a fountain for me night and day for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend for so the whole round earth is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of god but now farewell i am going a long way with these thou seëst—if indeed i go for all my mind is clouded with a doubt — to the island-valley of avilion where falls not hail or rain or any snow nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies deep-meadow 'd happy fair with orchard lawns and bowery hollows crown 'd with summer sea where i will heal me of my grievous wound '' so said he and the barge with oar and sail moved from the brink like some full-breasted swan that fluting a wild carol ere her death ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood with swarthy webs long stood sir bedivere revolving many memories till the hull look 'd one black dot against the verge of dawn and on the mere the wailing died away but when that moan had past for evermore the stillness of the dead world 's winter dawn amazed him and he groan 'd the king is gone '' and therewithal came on him the weird rhyme '' from the great deep to the great deep he goes '' whereat he slowly turn 'd and slowly clomb the last hard footstep of that iron crag thence mark 'd the black hull moving yet and cried '' he passes to be king among the dead and after healing of his grievous wound he comes again but—if he come no more— o me be yon dark queens in yon black boat who shriek 'd and wail 'd the three whereat we gazed on that high day when clothed with living light they stood before his throne in silence friends of arthur who should help him at his need '' then from the dawn it seem 'd there came but faint as from beyond the limit of the world like the last echo born of a great cry sounds as if some fair city were one voice around a king returning from his wars thereat once more he moved about and clomb ev'n to the highest he could climb and saw straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand or thought he saw the speck that bare the king down that long water opening on the deep somewhere far off pass on and on and go from less to less and vanish into light and the new sun rose bringing the new year

now in a breath we ’ ll burst those gates of gold and ransack heaven before our moment fails now in a breath before we too grow old we ’ ll mount and sing and spread immortal sails it is not time that makes eternity love and an hour may quite out-span the years and give us more to hear and more to see than life can wash away with all its tears dear when we part at last that sunset sky shall not be touched with deeper hues than this but we shall ride the lightning ere we die and seize our brief infinitude of bliss with time to spare for all that heaven can tell while eyes meet eyes and look their last farewell

we came so trustingly for love but these lowlands flatlands near beneath the sea point with their cautionary bones of sand to exorcize submerge us we stay free only as mermaids glittering in the waves mermaids of the imagination young a spring ago who know our loveliness banished like fireflies at winter ’ s breath because none saw these vines about our necks we placed in welcome once but now as wreath against the scalpel cold still cold creeps in to grow like ivy over our chilling bodies into our blood now in our diamond dress we wive only the sequins of the sea the lowlands have rejected us they lie athwart the whispering waters like a scar on a mirage of glass the dooming land where nothing can take root but frost has won and what of warmth and what of joy they are sequestered elsewhere southward where the sun speaks for all our mermaid vigilance and balance all goes under underneath the land ’ s gray wave we falter and fall back to hibernate within the caves of death
am i a character in the dreams of the god hermes the messenger certainly many of my dreams have nothing to do with the common life around me there are never any automobiles or airplanes in them these dreams belong to an age in the distant past to a time perhaps when nothing was written down to the time of memory i chose hermes not out of vanity but because from what i ’ ve read about him he had a pretty good time was not just a drunkard on olympus in his traipsings delivering divine messages he must have met some pretty girls who gave him pleasure we know that he invented the lyre for the benefit of poets and lucian relates in his dialogues of the dead that he was the god of sleep and dreams my dreams are not frightening they are not nightmares but their irrationality puzzles me what is hermes trying to tell me is he playing a game with me last monday night i dreamt about a school for young children who had heads but no bodies last night it was a cow that was galloping in our meadow like a horse another night and this one was a bit scary i swam across the lake with my head under water i didn ’ t have to breathe air what is the message of these dreams into what kind of world is hermes leading me it ’ s not the world described daily in the new york times a world of shadows a kind of levitation how can i pray to hermes to lay off these senseless fantasies tell him that i want real dreams such as my shrink can explicate i ’ ve looked up lustration in the dictionary its definition is not encouraging “ a prefatory ceremony performed as a preliminary to entering a holy place. ” that ’ s too impersonal i want a man-to-man talk with hermes telling him to stop infesting my nights with his nonsense
an end is always punishment for a beginning if you ’ re catholic sadness is punishment for happiness you become the bug you squash if you ’ re hindu a flinty space opens in your head after a long night of laughter and wine for waking there are dreams from french poetry english poetry for light fire although sometimes fire must be punished by light which is why psychotherapy had to be invented a father may say nothing to a son for years a wife may keep something small folded deep in her underwear drawer clouds come in resembling the terrible things we believe about ourselves a rock comes loose from a ledge the baby just cries and cries doll in a chair windshield wipers staring off into the city lights for years you may be unable to hear the word monkey without a stab in the heart because she called you that the summer she thought she loved you and you thought you loved someone else and everyone loved your salad dressing and the daffodils come up in the spring and the snow covers the road in winter and the water covers the deep trenches in the sea where all the time the inner stuff of this earth surges up which is how the continents are made and broken
this sycamore oft musical with bees — such tents the patriarchs loved o long unharmed may all its agèd boughs o'er-canopy the small round basin which this jutting stone keeps pure from falling leaves long may the spring quietly as a sleeping infant 's breath send up cold waters to the traveller with soft and even pulse nor ever cease yon tiny cone of sand its soundless dance which at the bottom like a fairy 's page as merry and no taller dances still nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the fount here twilight is and coolness here is moss a soft seat and a deep and ample shade thou may'st toil far and find no second tree drink pilgrim here here rest and if thy heart be innocent here too shalt thou refresh thy spirit listening to some gentle sound or passing gale or hum of murmuring bees
we were apart yet day by day i bade my heart more constant be i bade it keep the world away and grow a home for only thee nor fear 'd but thy love likewise grew like mine each day more tried more true the fault was grave i might have known what far too soon alas i learn'd— the heart can bind itself alone and faith may oft be unreturn 'd self-sway 'd our feelings ebb and swell— thou lov'st no more —farewell farewell farewell —and thou thou lonely heart which never yet without remorse even for a moment didst depart from thy remote and spher e d course to haunt the place where passions reign— back to thy solitude again back with the conscious thrill of shame which luna felt that summer-night flash through her pure immortal frame when she forsook the starry height to hang over endymion 's sleep upon the pine-grown latmian steep yet she chaste queen had never proved how vain a thing is mortal love wandering in heaven far removed but thou hast long had place to prove this truth—to prove and make thine own '' thou hast been shalt be art alone '' or if not quite alone yet they which touch thee are unmating things— ocean and clouds and night and day lorn autumns and triumphant springs and life and others joy and pain and love if love of happier men of happier men—for they at least have dream 'd two human hearts might blend in one and were through faith released from isolation without end prolong 'd nor knew although not less alone than thou their loneliness

part i on either side the river lie long fields of barley and of rye that clothe the wold and meet the sky and thro the field the road runs by to many-tower 'd camelot and up and down the people go

from breakfast on through all the day at home among my friends i stay but every night i go abroad afar into the land of nod all by myself i have to go with none to tell me what to do — all alone beside the streams and up the mountain-sides of dreams the strangest things are there for me both things to eat and things to see and many frightening sights abroad till morning in the land of nod try as i like to find the way i never can get back by day nor can remember plain and clear the curious music that i hear
listen my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of paul revere on the eighteenth of april in seventy-five hardly a man is now alive who remembers that famous day and year he said to his friend `` if the british march by land or sea from the town to-night hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light — one if by land and two if by sea and i on the opposite shore will be ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm for the country folk to be up and to arm '' then he said `` good night '' and with muffled oar silently rowed to the charlestown shore just as the moon rose over the bay where swinging wide at her moorings lay the somerset british man-of-war a phantom ship with each mast and spar across the moon like a prison bar and a huge black hulk that was magnified by its own reflection in the tide meanwhile his friend through alley and street wanders and watches with eager ears till in the silence around him he hears the muster of men at the barrack door the sound of arms and the tramp of feet and the measured tread of the grenadiers marching down to their boats on the shore then he climbed the tower of the old north church by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread to the belfry-chamber overhead and startled the pigeons from their perch on the sombre rafters that round him made masses and moving shapes of shade — by the trembling ladder steep and tall to the highest window in the wall where he paused to listen and look down a moment on the roofs of the town and the moonlight flowing over all beneath in the churchyard lay the dead in their night-encampment on the hill wrapped in silence so deep and still that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread the watchful night-wind as it went creeping along from tent to tent and seeming to whisper `` all is well '' a moment only he feels the spell of the place and the hour and the secret dread of the lonely belfry and the dead for suddenly all his thoughts are bent on a shadowy something far away where the river widens to meet the bay — a line of black that bends and floats on the rising tide like a bridge of boats meanwhile impatient to mount and ride booted and spurred with a heavy stride on the opposite shore walked paul revere now he patted his horse 's side now gazed at the landscape far and near then impetuous stamped the earth and turned and tightened his saddle girth but mostly he watched with eager search the belfry-tower of the old north church as it rose above the graves on the hill lonely and spectral and sombre and still and lo as he looks on the belfry 's height a glimmer and then a gleam of light he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns but lingers and gazes till full on his sight a second lamp in the belfry burns a hurry of hoofs in a village street a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet that was all and yet through the gloom and the light the fate of a nation was riding that night and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight kindled the land into flame with its heat he has left the village and mounted the steep and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep is the mystic meeting the ocean tides and under the alders that skirt its edge now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides it was twelve by the village clock when he crossed the bridge into medford town he heard the crowing of the cock and the barking of the farmer 's dog and felt the damp of the river fog that rises after the sun goes down it was one by the village clock when he galloped into lexington he saw the gilded weathercock swim in the moonlight as he passed and the meeting-house windows blank and bare gaze at him with a spectral glare as if they already stood aghast at the bloody work they would look upon it was two by the village clock when he came to the bridge in concord town he heard the bleating of the flock and the twitter of birds among the trees and felt the breath of the morning breeze blowing over the meadows brown and one was safe and asleep in his bed who at the bridge would be first to fall who that day would be lying dead pierced by a british musket-ball you know the rest in the books you have read how the british regulars fired and fled — how the farmers gave them ball for ball from behind each fence and farm-yard wall chasing the red-coats down the lane then crossing the fields to emerge again under the trees at the turn of the road and only pausing to fire and load so through the night rode paul revere and so through the night went his cry of alarm to every middlesex village and farm — a cry of defiance and not of fear a voice in the darkness a knock at the door and a word that shall echo forevermore for borne on the night-wind of the past through all our history to the last in the hour of darkness and peril and need the people will waken and listen to hear the hurrying hoof-beats of that steed and the midnight message of paul revere

speck wherein the pained blood falters and goes out soft and stung softly — fairer for a fleck but though my lips shut sucking on the place there is no vein at work upon her face her eyelids are so peaceable no doubt deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways lo this is she that was the world 's delight the old grey years were parcels of her might the strewings of the ways wherein she trod were the twain seasons of the day and night lo she was thus when her clear limbs enticed all lips that now grow sad with kissing christ stained with blood fallen from the feet of god the feet and hands whereat our souls were priced alas lord surely thou art great and fair but lo her wonderfully woven hair and thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss but see now lord her mouth is lovelier she is right fair what hath she done to thee nay fair lord christ lift up thine eyes and see had now thy mother such a lip — like this thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me inside the horsel here the air is hot right little peace one hath for it god wot the scented dusty daylight burns the air and my heart chokes me till i hear it not behold my venus my soul 's body lies with my love laid upon her garment-wise feeling my love in all her limbs and hair and shed between her eyelids through her eyes she holds my heart in her sweet open hands hanging asleep hard by her head there stands crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire love wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands — hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume that shift and steam — loose clots of arid fume from the sea 's panting mouth of dry desire there stands he like one labouring at a loom the warp holds fast across and every thread that makes the woof up has dry specks of red always the shuttle cleaves clean through and he weaves with the hair of many a ruined head love is not glad nor sorry as i deem labouring he dreams and labours in the dream till when the spool is finished lo i see his web reeled off curls and goes out like steam night falls like fire the heavy lights run low and as they drop my blood and body so shake as the flame shakes full of days and hours that sleep not neither weep they as they go ah yet would god this flesh of mine might be where air might wash and long leaves cover me where tides of grass break into foam of flowers or where the wind 's feet shine along the sea ah yet would god that stems and roots were bred out of my weary body and my head that sleep were sealed upon me with a seal and i were as the least of all his dead would god my blood were dew to feed the grass mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass my body broken as a turning wheel and my mouth stricken ere it saith alas ah god that love were as a flower or flame that life were as the naming of a name that death were not more pitiful than desire that these things were not one thing and the same behold now surely somewhere there is death for each man hath some space of years he saith a little space of time ere time expire a little day a little way of breath and lo between the sundawn and the sun his day 's work and his night 's work are undone and lo between the nightfall and the light he is not and none knoweth of such an one ah god that i were as all souls that be as any herb or leaf of any tree as men that toil through hours of labouring night as bones of men under the deep sharp sea outside it must be winter among men for at the gold bars of the gates again i heard all night and all the hours of it the wind 's wet wings and fingers drip with rain knights gather riding sharp for cold i know the ways and woods are strangled with the snow and with short song the maidens spin and sit until christ 's birthnight lily-like arow the scent and shadow shed about me make the very soul in all my senses ache the hot hard night is fed upon my breath and sleep beholds me from afar awake alas but surely where the hills grow deep or where the wild ways of the sea are steep or in strange places somewhere there is death and on death 's face the scattered hair of sleep there lover-like with lips and limbs that meet they lie they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat but me the hot and hungry days devour and in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet no fruit of theirs but fruit of my desire for her love 's sake whose lips through mine respire her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire so lie we not as sleep that lies by death with heavy kisses and with happy breath not as man lies by woman when the bride laughs low for love 's sake and the words he saith for she lies laughing low with love she lies and turns his kisses on her lips to sighs to sighing sound of lips unsatisfied and the sweet tears are tender with her eyes ah not as they but as the souls that were slain in the old time having found her fair who sleeping with her lips upon their eyes heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair their blood runs round the roots of time like rain she casts them forth and gathers them again with nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain her little chambers drip with flower-like red her girdles and the chaplets of her head her armlets and her anklets with her feet she tramples all that winepress of the dead her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires with loves burnt out and unassuaged desires between her lips the steam of them is sweet the languor in her ears of many lyres her beds are full of perfume and sad sound her doors are made with music and barred round with sighing and with laughter and with tears with tears whereby strong souls of men are bound there is the knight adonis that was slain with flesh and blood she chains him for a chain the body and the spirit in her ears cry for her lips divide him vein by vein yea all she slayeth yea every man save me me love thy lover that must cleave to thee till the ending of the days and ways of earth the shaking of the sources of the sea me most forsaken of all souls that fell me satiated with things insatiable me for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth yea laughter kindles at the heart of hell alas thy beauty for thy mouth 's sweet sake my soul is bitter to me my limbs quake as water as the flesh of men that weep as their heart 's vein whose heart goes nigh to break ah god that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips would crush the fruit of death upon my lips ah god that death would tread the grapes of sleep and wring their juice upon me as it drips there is no change of cheer for many days but change of chimes high up in the air that sways rung by the running fingers of the wind and singing sorrows heard on hidden ways day smiteth day in twain night sundereth night and on mine eyes the dark sits as the light yea lord thou knowest i know not having sinned if heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight yea as if earth were sprinkled over me such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea each pore doth yearn and the dried blood thereof gasps by sick fits my heart swims heavily there is a feverish famine in my veins below her bosom where a crushed grape stains the white and blue there my lips caught and clove an hour since and what mark of me remains i dare not always touch her lest the kiss leave my lips charred yea lord a little bliss brief bitter bliss one hath for a great sin nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is sin is it sin whereby men 's souls are thrust into the pit yet had i a good trust to save my soul before it slipped therein trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust for if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath i look between the iron sides of death into sad hell where all sweet love hath end all but the pain that never finisheth there are the naked faces of great kings the singing folk with all their lute-playings there when one cometh he shall have to friend the grave that covets and the worm that clings there sit the knights that were so great of hand the ladies that were queens of fair green land grown grey and black now brought unto the dust soiled without raiment clad about with sand there is one end for all of them they sit naked and sad they drink the dregs of it trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust trampled and trodden by the fiery feet i see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell cities and people whom the gods loved well yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold and for their sakes on her the fire of hell and softer than the egyptian lote-leaf is the queen whose face was worth the world to kiss wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold and large pale lips of strong semiramis curled like a tiger 's that curl back to feed red only where the last kiss made them bleed her hair most thick with many a carven gem deep in the mane great-chested like a steed yea with red sin the faces of them shine but in all these there was no sin like mine no not in all the strange great sins of them that made the wine-press froth and foam with wine for i was of christ 's choosing i god 's knight no blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light i can well see for all the dusty days gone past the clean great time of goodly fight i smell the breathing battle sharp with blows with shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows the fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways sounds and long lights are shed between the rows of beautiful mailed men the edged light slips most like a snake that takes short breath and dips sharp from the beautifully bending head with all its gracious body lithe as lips that curl in touching you right in this wise my sword doth seeming fire in mine own eyes leaving all colours in them brown and red and flecked with death then the keen breaths like sighs the caught-up choked dry laughters following them when all the fighting face is grown a flame for pleasure and the pulse that stuns the ears and the heart 's gladness of the goodly game let me think yet a little i do know these things were sweet but sweet such years ago their savour is all turned now into tears yea ten years since where the blue ripples blow the blue curled eddies of the blowing rhine i felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine touch my blood too and sting me with delight through all this waste and weary body of mine that never feels clear air right gladly then i rode alone a great way off my men and heard the chiming bridle smite and smite and gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again till my song shifted to that iron one seeing there rode up between me and the sun some certain of my foe 's men for his three white wolves across their painted coats did run the first red-bearded with square cheeks — alack i made my knave 's blood turn his beard to black the slaying of him was a joy to see perchance too when at night he came not back some woman fell a-weeping whom this thief would beat when he had drunken yet small grief hath any for the ridding of such knaves yea if one wept i doubt her teen was brief this bitter love is sorrow in all lands draining of eyelids wringing of drenched hands sighing of hearts and filling up of graves a sign across the head of the world he stands an one that hath a plague-mark on his brows dust and spilt blood do track him to his house down under earth sweet smells of lip and cheek like a sweet snake 's breath made more poisonous with chewing of some perfumed deadly grass are shed all round his passage if he pass and their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was as one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds and tracking ever slotwise the warm smell is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds his head far down the hot sweet throat of her — so one tracks love whose breath is deadlier and lo one springe and you are fast in hell fast as the gin 's grip of a wayfarer i think now as the heavy hours decease one after one and bitter thoughts increase one upon one of all sweet finished things the breaking of the battle the long peace wherein we sat clothed softly each man 's hair crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair the sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings and noise of singing in the late sweet air i sang of love too knowing nought thereof '' sweeter '' i said `` the little laugh of love than tears out of the eyes of magdalen or any fallen feather of the dove `` the broken little laugh that spoils a kiss the ache of purple pulses and the bliss of blinded eyelids that expand again — love draws them open with those lips of his '' lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown of one same fire and colour with their own then ere one sleep appeased with sacrifice where his lips wounded there his lips atone '' i sang these things long since and knew them not '' lo here is love or there is love god wot this man and that finds favour in his eyes '' i said `` but i what guerdon have i got `` the dust of praise that is blown everywhere in all men 's faces with the common air the bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet before they wind it in a singer 's hair '' so that one dawn i rode forth sorrowing i had no hope but of some evil thing and so rode slowly past the windy wheat and past the vineyard and the water-spring up to the horsel a great elder-tree held back its heaps of flowers to let me see the ripe tall grass and one that walked therein naked with hair shed over to the knee she walked between the blossom and the grass i knew the beauty of her what she was the beauty of her body and her sin and in my flesh the sin of hers alas alas for sorrow is all the end of this o sad kissed mouth how sorrowful it is o breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings red with the bitter blossom of a kiss ah with blind lips i felt for you and found about my neck your hands and hair enwound the hands that stifle and the hair that stings i felt them fasten sharply without sound yea for my sin i had great store of bliss rise up make answer for me let thy kiss seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is yet i waxed faint with fume of barren bowers and murmuring of the heavy-headed hours and let the dove 's beak fret and peck within my lips in vain and love shed fruitless flowers so that god looked upon me when your hands were hot about me yea god brake my bands to save my soul alive and i came forth like a man blind and naked in strange lands that hears men laugh and weep and knows not whence nor wherefore but is broken in his sense howbeit i met folk riding from the north towards rome to purge them of their souls offence and rode with them and spake to none the day stunned me like lights upon some wizard way and ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight so rode i hearing all these chant and pray and marvelled till before us rose and fell white cursed hills like outer skirts of hell seen where men 's eyes look through the day to night like a jagged shell 's lips harsh untunable blown in between by devils wrangling breath nathless we won well past that hell and death down to the sweet land where all airs are good even unto rome where god 's grace tarrieth then came each man and worshipped at his knees who in the lord god 's likeness bears the keys to bind or loose and called on christ 's shed blood and so the sweet-souled father gave him ease but when i came i fell down at his feet saying `` father though the lord 's blood be right sweet the spot it takes not off the panther 's skin nor shall an ethiop 's stain be bleached with it `` lo i have sinned and have spat out at god wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod more sharp because of mine exceeding sin and all his raiment redder than bright blood '' before mine eyes yea for my sake i wot the heat of hell is waxen seven times hot through my great sin '' then spake he some sweet word giving me cheer which thing availed me not yea scarce i wist if such indeed were said for when i ceased — lo as one newly dead who hears a great cry out of hell i heard the crying of his voice across my head `` until this dry shred staff that hath no whit of leaf nor bark bear blossom and smell sweet seek thou not any mercy in god 's sight for so long shalt thou be cast out from it '' yea what if dried-up stems wax red and green shall that thing be which is not nor has been yea what if sapless bark wax green and white shall any good fruit grow upon my sin nay though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree and though men drew sweet waters of the sea there should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem this waste wan body and shaken soul of me yea though god search it warily enough there is not one sound thing in all thereof though he search all my veins through searching them he shall find nothing whole therein but love for i came home right heavy with small cheer and lo my love mine own soul 's heart more dear than mine own soul more beautiful than god who hath my being between the hands of her — fair still but fair for no man saving me as when she came out of the naked sea making the foam as fire whereon she trod and as the inner flower of fire was she yea she laid hold upon me and her mouth clove unto mine as soul to body doth and laughing made her lips luxurious her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south strange spice and flower strange savour of crushed fruit and perfume the swart kings tread underfoot for pleasure when their minds wax amorous charred frankincense and grated sandal-root and i forgot fear and all weary things all ended prayers and perished thanksgivings feeling her face with all her eager hair cleave to me clinging as a fire that clings to the body and to the raiment burning them as after death i know that such-like flame shall cleave to me for ever yea what care albeit i burn then having felt the same ah love there is no better life than this to have known love how bitter a thing it is and afterward be cast out of god 's sight yea these that know not shall they have such bliss high up in barren heaven before his face as we twain in the heavy-hearted place remembering love and all the dead delight and all that time was sweet with for a space for till the thunder in the trumpet be soul may divide from body but not we one from another i hold thee with my hand i let mine eyes have all their will of thee i seal myself upon thee with my might abiding alway out of all men 's sight until god loosen over sea and land the thunder of the trumpets of the night
the cold earth slept below above the cold sky shone and all around with a chilling sound from caves of ice and fields of snow the breath of night like death did flow beneath the sinking moon the wintry hedge was black the green grass was not seen the birds did rest on the bare thorn ’ s breast whose roots beside the pathway track had bound their folds o ’ er many a crack which the frost had made between thine eyes glow ’ d in the glare of the moon ’ s dying light as a fen-fire ’ s beam on a sluggish stream gleams dimly—so the moon shone there and it yellow ’ d the strings of thy tangled hair that shook in the wind of night the moon made thy lips pale beloved the wind made thy bosom chill the night did shed on thy dear head its frozen dew and thou didst lie where the bitter breath of the naked sky might visit thee at will
little boy blue come blow your horn the sheep 's in the meadow the cow 's in the corn but where is the boy who looks after the sheep he 's under a haystack fast asleep
`` courage '' he said and pointed toward the land '' this mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon '' in the afternoon they came unto a land in which it seemed always afternoon all round the coast the languid air did swoon breathing like one that hath a weary dream full-faced above the valley stood the moon and like a downward smoke the slender stream along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem a land of streams some like a downward smoke slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn did go and some thro wavering lights and shadows broke rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below they saw the gleaming river seaward flow from the inner land far off three mountain-tops three silent pinnacles of aged snow stood sunset-flush 'd and dew 'd with showery drops up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse the charmed sunset linger 'd low adown in the red west thro mountain clefts the dale was seen far inland and the yellow down border 'd with palm and many a winding vale and meadow set with slender galingale a land where all things always seem 'd the same and round about the keel with faces pale dark faces pale against that rosy flame the mild-eyed melancholy lotos-eaters came branches they bore of that enchanted stem laden with flower and fruit whereof they gave to each but whoso did receive of them and taste to him the gushing of the wave far far away did seem to mourn and rave on alien shores and if his fellow spake his voice was thin as voices from the grave and deep-asleep he seem 'd yet all awake and music in his ears his beating heart did make they sat them down upon the yellow sand between the sun and moon upon the shore and sweet it was to dream of fatherland of child and wife and slave but evermore most weary seem 'd the sea weary the oar weary the wandering fields of barren foam then some one said `` we will return no more '' and all at once they sang `` our island home is far beyond the wave we will no longer roam '' choric song i there is sweet music here that softer falls than petals from blown roses on the grass or night-dews on still waters between walls of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass music that gentlier on the spirit lies than tir 'd eyelids upon tir 'd eyes music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies here are cool mosses deep and thro the moss the ivies creep and in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep and from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep '' ii why are we weigh 'd upon with heaviness and utterly consumed with sharp distress while all things else have rest from weariness all things have rest why should we toil alone we only toil who are the first of things and make perpetual moan still from one sorrow to another thrown nor ever fold our wings and cease from wanderings nor steep our brows in slumber 's holy balm nor harken what the inner spirit sings '' there is no joy but calm '' why should we only toil the roof and crown of things iii lo in the middle of the wood the folded leaf is woo 'd from out the bud with winds upon the branch and there grows green and broad and takes no care sun-steep 'd at noon and in the moon nightly dew-fed and turning yellow falls and floats adown the air lo sweeten 'd with the summer light the full-juiced apple waxing over-mellow drops in a silent autumn night all its allotted length of days the flower ripens in its place ripens and fades and falls and hath no toil fast-rooted in the fruitful soil iv hateful is the dark-blue sky vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea death is the end of life ah why should life all labour be let us alone time driveth onward fast and in a little while our lips are dumb let us alone what is it that will last all things are taken from us and become portions and parcels of the dreadful past let us alone what pleasure can we have to war with evil is there any peace in ever climbing up the climbing wave all things have rest and ripen toward the grave in silence ripen fall and cease give us long rest or death dark death or dreamful ease v how sweet it were hearing the downward stream with half-shut eyes ever to seem falling asleep in a half-dream to dream and dream like yonder amber light which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height to hear each other 's whisper 'd speech eating the lotos day by day to watch the crisping ripples on the beach and tender curving lines of creamy spray to lend our hearts and spirits wholly to the influence of mild-minded melancholy to muse and brood and live again in memory with those old faces of our infancy heap 'd over with a mound of grass two handfuls of white dust shut in an urn of brass vi dear is the memory of our wedded lives and dear the last embraces of our wives and their warm tears but all hath suffer 'd change for surely now our household hearths are cold our sons inherit us our looks are strange and we should come like ghosts to trouble joy or else the island princes over-bold have eat our substance and the minstrel sings before them of the ten years war in troy and our great deeds as half-forgotten things is there confusion in the little isle let what is broken so remain the gods are hard to reconcile 'tis hard to settle order once again there is confusion worse than death trouble on trouble pain on pain long labour unto aged breath sore task to hearts worn out by many wars and eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars vii but propt on beds of amaranth and moly how sweet while warm airs lull us blowing lowly with half-dropt eyelid still beneath a heaven dark and holy to watch the long bright river drawing slowly his waters from the purple hill— to hear the dewy echoes calling from cave to cave thro the thick-twined vine— to watch the emerald-colour 'd water falling thro many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine only to hear were sweet stretch 'd out beneath the pine viii the lotos blooms below the barren peak the lotos blows by every winding creek all day the wind breathes low with mellower tone thro every hollow cave and alley lone round and round the spicy downs the yellow lotos-dust is blown we have had enough of action and of motion we roll 'd to starboard roll 'd to larboard when the surge was seething free where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea let us swear an oath and keep it with an equal mind in the hollow lotos-land to live and lie reclined on the hills like gods together careless of mankind for they lie beside their nectar and the bolts are hurl'd far below them in the valleys and the clouds are lightly curl'd round their golden houses girdled with the gleaming world where they smile in secret looking over wasted lands blight and famine plague and earthquake roaring deeps and fiery sands clanging fights and flaming towns and sinking ships and praying hands but they smile they find a music centred in a doleful song steaming up a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong like a tale of little meaning tho the words are strong chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil sow the seed and reap the harvest with enduring toil storing yearly little dues of wheat and wine and oil till they perish and they suffer—some 't is whisper'd—down in hell suffer endless anguish others in elysian valleys dwell resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel surely surely slumber is more sweet than toil the shore than labour in the deep mid-ocean wind and wave and oar o rest ye brother mariners we will not wander more
yet once more o ye laurels and once more ye myrtles brown with ivy never sere i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude and with forc 'd fingers rude shatter your leaves before the mellowing year bitter constraint and sad occasion dear compels me to disturb your season due for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime young lycidas and hath not left his peer who would not sing for lycidas he knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme he must not float upon his wat'ry bier unwept and welter to the parching wind without the meed of some melodious tear begin then sisters of the sacred well that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string hence with denial vain and coy excuse so may some gentle muse with lucky words favour my destin 'd urn and as he passes turn and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud for we were nurs 'd upon the self-same hill fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill together both ere the high lawns appear'd under the opening eyelids of the morn we drove afield and both together heard what time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn batt'ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night oft till the star that rose at ev'ning bright toward heav'n 's descent had slop 'd his westering wheel meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute temper 'd to th'oaten flute rough satyrs danc 'd and fauns with clov'n heel from the glad sound would not be absent long and old damætas lov 'd to hear our song but o the heavy change now thou art gone now thou art gone and never must return thee shepherd thee the woods and desert

when i was young exorcisms were quite common a remedy not unlike ice baths plus devils were shorter in those days just as people were they had n't eaten enough fruits or vegetables and lacked essential vitamins and iron grew thin and pale fell easily into brooding depressions they looked more like deer than sheep and when they possessed you it was usually because they were fleeing from someone else and did n't realize where they were until it was too late it was more a question of giving directions than driving them out `` turn right at the hairdresser 's go straight until you get to the abandoned schoolhouse then turn left you should see the exit from there '' `` thank you i was completely lost '' `` you 're welcome good luck '' `` you too and thanks again ''
there is a river under this poem it flows blue and icy and carries these lines down the page somewhere beneath its surface lying chained to the silt harry holds his breath and slowly files his fingernails into moons he wonders who still waits at the dock if the breasts of those young girls have developed since he sank he thinks of his parents of listening to the tumblers of his mother 's womb of escaping upward out of puberty out of the pupils in his father 's eyes and those hot wisconsin fields he dreams of escaping from this poem of cracking the combinations to his own body and those warm young safes of every girl on the dock jiggling his chains harry scares a carp that circles and nibbles at his feet he feels the blue rush of the current sweeping across his body stripping his chains of their rust until each link softens and glows like a tiny eel and harry decides to ascend he slips with the water through his chains and climbing over and over his own air bubbles he waves to the fish to his chains glittering and squirming in the silt he pauses to pick a bouquet of seaweed for the young girls on the dock rising he bursts the surface of this poem he listens for shouts he hears only the night and a buoy sloshing in the blue
the truth is i ’ ve never cared for the national anthem if you think about it it ’ s not a good song too high for most of us with “ the rockets red glare ” and then there are the bombs always always there is war and bombs once i sang it at homecoming and threw even the tenacious high school band off key but the song didn ’ t mean anything just a call to the field something to get through before the pummeling of youth and what of the stanzas we never sing the third that mentions “ no refuge could save the hireling and the slave ” perhaps the truth is every song of this country has an unsung third stanza something brutal snaking underneath us as we blindly sing the high notes with a beer sloshing in the stands hoping our team wins don ’ t get me wrong i do like the flag how it undulates in the wind like water elemental and best when it ’ s humbled brought to its knees clung to by someone who has lost everything when it ’ s not a weapon when it flickers when it folds up so perfectly you can keep it until it ’ s needed until you can love it again until the song in your mouth feels like sustenance a song where the notes are sung by even the ageless woods the short-grass plains the red river gorge the fistful of land left unpoisoned that song that ’ s our birthright that ’ s sung in silence when it ’ s too hard to go on that sounds like someone ’ s rough fingers weaving into another ’ s that sounds like a match being lit in an endless cave the song that says my bones are your bones and your bones are my bones and isn ’ t that enough
we passed old farmer boothby in the field rugged and straight he stood his body steeled with stubbornness and age we met his eyes that never flinched or turned to compromise and “ luck ” he cried “ good luck ” —and waved an arm knotted and sailor-like such as no farm in all of maine could boast of and away he turned again to pitch his new-cut hay ... we walked on leisurely until a bend showed him once more now working toward the end of one great path wearing his eighty years like banners lifted in a wind of cheers then we turned off abruptly—took the road cutting the village the one with the commanding view of the river and we strode more briskly now to the long pier that showed where the frail boats were kept at indian landing in the canoe we stepped our paddles dipped leisurely downwards and the slim bark slipped more on than in the water smoothly then we shot its nose against the rippling current feeling the rising river ’ s half-deterrent pull on the paddle as we turned the blade to keep from swerving round while we delayed to watch the curious wave-eaten locks or pass with lazy turns the picnic-rocks ... blue eels flew under us and fishes darted a thousand ways the once broad channel shrunk and over us the wise and noble-hearted twilight leaned down the sunset mists were parted — and we with thoughts on tiptoe slunk down the green twisting alleys of the kennebunk motionless in the meadows the trees the rocks the cows ... and quiet dripped from the shadows like rain from heavy boughs the tree-toads started ringing their ceaseless silver bells a land-locked breeze came swinging its censer of earthy smells the river ’ s tiny cañon stretched into dusky lands like a dark and silent companion evening held out her hands hushed were the dawn ’ s bravados loud noon was a silenced cry— and quiet slipped from the shadows as stars slip out of the sky ... it must have been an hour more or later when tramping homeward through the piney wood we felt the years fly back the brotherhood of forests took us—and we saw the satyr there in a pool up to his neck he stood and grinned to see us stare incredulous— too startled to remember fear or flight feeling the menace in the crafty night we turned to run—when lo he called to us using our very names he called we drew with creaking courage down the avenue of birches till we saw with clearing sight no longer through a tricky pale-green light familiar turns and shrubs the friendly path — and farmer boothby in his woodland bath the woods became his background every tree seemed part of him and stood erect and shared the beauty of that gnarled serenity the quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared its shoulders against time ... and even night flowed in and out of him as though content with such a native element happy to move about a spirit quite as old as placid and as confident ... sideways we turned still glistening and unclad he leaped up on the bank light as a lad his body in the moonlight dripping stars ... we went on homeward through the pasture-bars
old meg she was a gipsy and liv 'd upon the moors her bed it was the brown heath turf and her house was out of doors her apples were swart blackberries her currants pods o broom her wine was dew of the wild white rose her book a churchyard tomb her brothers were the craggy hills her sisters larchen trees— alone with her great family she liv 'd as she did please no breakfast had she many a morn no dinner many a noon and 'stead of supper she would stare full hard against the moon but every morn of woodbine fresh she made her garlanding and every night the dark glen yew she wove and she would sing and with her fingers old and brown she plaited mats o rushes and gave them to the cottagers she met among the bushes old meg was brave as margaret queen and tall as amazon an old red blanket cloak she wore a chip hat had she on god rest her aged bones somewhere— she died full long agone

i cut a staff in a churchyard copse i clad myself in ragged things i set a feather in my cap that fell out of an angel ’ s wings i filled my wallet with white stones i took three foxgloves in my hand i slung my shoes across my back and so i went to fairyland but lo within that ancient place science had reared her iron crown and the great cloud of steam went up that telleth where she takes a town but cowled with smoke and starred with lamps that strange land ’ s light was still its own the word that witched the woods and hills spoke in the iron and the stone not nature ’ s hand had ever curved that mute unearthly porter ’ s spine like sleeping dragon ’ s sudden eyes the signals leered along the line the chimneys thronging crooked or straight were fingers signalling the sky the dog that strayed across the street seemed four-legged by monstrosity ‘ in vain ’ i cried ‘ though you too touch the new time ’ s desecrating hand through all the noises of a town i hear the heart of fairyland. ’ i read the name above a door then through my spirit pealed and passed ‘ this is the town of thine own home and thou hast looked on it at last ’
the monsters in my closet like to sleep the day away so when i get home from school i let them out to play when mom calls me for supper i give them each a broom first they put my toys away and then they clean my room the mummy hates to vacuum so if he starts to whine i kick his rear and tell him “ trade jobs with frankenstein. ” wolfman used to fold my clothes i ’ ll give him one more chance— last time he wasn ’ t careful and left furballs in my pants when my room is nice and neat i bring them up some food but dracula wants to drink my blood— i think that ’ s pretty rude when it ’ s time to go to bed i hug them all goodnight they jump back in my closet while i turn out the light i ’ ve taken care of monsters for as long as i recall but the monsters in my closet are the nicest ones of all
so all day long the noise of battle roll'd among the mountains by the winter sea until king arthur 's table man by man had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord king arthur then because his wound was deep the bold sir bedivere uplifted him sir bedivere the last of all his knights and bore him to a chapel nigh the field a broken chancel with a broken cross that stood on a dark strait of barren land on one side lay the ocean and on one lay a great water and the moon was full then spake king arthur to sir bedivere '' the sequel of to-day unsolders all the goodliest fellowship of famous knights whereof this world holds record such a sleep they sleep—the men i loved i think that we shall never more at any future time delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds walking about the gardens and the halls of camelot as in the days that were i perish by this people which i made — tho merlin sware that i should come again to rule once more—but let what will be be i am so deeply smitten thro the helm that without help i can not last till morn thou therefore take my brand excalibur which was my pride for thou rememberest how in those old days one summer noon an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake clothed in white samite mystic wonderful holding the sword—and how i row 'd across and took it and have worn it like a king and wheresoever i am sung or told in aftertime this also shall be known but now delay not take excalibur and fling him far into the middle mere watch what thou seëst and lightly bring me word '' to him replied the bold sir bedivere '' it is not meet sir king to leave thee thus aidless alone and smitten thro the helm a little thing may harm a wounded man yet i thy hest will all perform at full watch what i see and lightly bring thee word '' so saying from the ruin 'd shrine he stept and in the moon athwart the place of tombs where lay the mighty bones of ancient men old knights and over them the sea-wind sang shrill chill with flakes of foam he stepping down by zigzag paths and juts of pointed rock came on the shining levels of the lake there drew he forth the brand excalibur and o'er him drawing it the winter moon brightening the skirts of a long cloud ran forth and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks myriads of topaz-lights and jacinth work of subtlest jewellery he gazed so long that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood this way and that dividing the swift mind in act to throw but at the last it seem'd better to leave excalibur conceal'd there in the many-knotted water-flags that whistled stiff and dry about the marge so strode he back slow to the wounded king then spake king arthur to sir bedivere '' hast thou perform 'd my mission which i gave what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard '' and answer made the bold sir bedivere '' i heard the ripple washing in the reeds and the wild water lapping on the crag '' to whom replied king arthur faint and pale '' thou hast betray 'd thy nature and thy name not rendering true answer as beseem'd thy fealty nor like a noble knight for surer sign had follow 'd either hand or voice or else a motion of the mere this is a shameful thing for men to lie yet now i charge thee quickly go again as thou art lief and dear and do the thing i bade thee watch and lightly bring me word '' then went sir bedivere the second time across the ridge and paced beside the mere counting the dewy pebbles fixed in thought but when he saw the wonder of the hilt how curiously and strangely chased he smote his palms together and he cried aloud `` and if indeed i cast the brand away surely a precious thing one worthy note should thus be lost forever from the earth which might have pleased the eyes of many men what good should follow this if this were done what harm undone deep harm to disobey seeing obedience is the bond of rule were it well to obey then if a king demand an act unprofitable against himself the king is sick and knows not what he does what record or what relic of my lord should be to aftertime but empty breath and rumours of a doubt but were this kept stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings some one might show it at a joust of arms saying 'king arthur 's sword excalibur wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills so might some old man speak in the aftertime to all the people winning reverence but now much honour and much fame were lost '' so spake he clouded with his own conceit and hid excalibur the second time and so strode back slow to the wounded king then spoke king arthur breathing heavily '' what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard '' and answer made the bold sir bedivere '' i heard the water lapping on the crag and the long ripple washing in the reeds '' to whom replied king arthur much in wrath '' ah miserable and unkind untrue unknightly traitor-hearted woe is me authority forgets a dying king laid widow 'd of the power in his eye that bow 'd the will i see thee what thou art for thou the latest-left of all my knights in whom should meet the offices of all thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt either from lust of gold or like a girl valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes yet for a man may fail in duty twice and the third time may prosper get thee hence but if thou spare to fling excalibur i will arise and slay thee with my hands '' then quickly rose sir bedivere and ran and leaping down the ridges lightly plunged among the bulrush-beds and clutch 'd the sword and strongly wheel 'd and threw it the great brand made lightnings in the splendour of the moon and flashing round and round and whirl 'd in an arch shot like a streamer of the northern morn seen where the moving isles of winter shock by night with noises of the northern sea so flash 'd and fell the brand excalibur but ere he dipt the surface rose an arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful and caught him by the hilt and brandish 'd him three times and drew him under in the mere and lightly went the other to the king then spoke king arthur drawing thicker breath '' now see i by thine eyes that this is done speak out what is it thou hast heard or seen '' and answer made the bold sir bedivere '' sir king i closed mine eyelids lest the gems should blind my purpose for i never saw nor shall see here or elsewhere till i die not tho i live three lives of mortal men so great a miracle as yonder hilt then with both hands i flung him wheeling him but when i look 'd again behold an arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful that caught him by the hilt and brandish 'd him three times and drew him under in the mere '' and answer made king arthur breathing hard '' my end draws nigh 't is time that i were gone make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight and bear me to the margin yet i fear my wound hath taken cold and i shall die '' so saying from the pavement he half rose slowly with pain reclining on his arm and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture him sir bedivere remorsefully regarded thro his tears and would have spoken but he found not words then took with care and kneeling on one knee o'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands and rising bore him thro the place of tombs but as he walk 'd king arthur panted hard like one that feels a nightmare on his bed when all the house is mute so sigh 'd the king muttering and murmuring at his ear `` quick quick i fear it is too late and i shall die '' but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge clothed with his breath and looking as he walk'd larger than human on the frozen hills he heard the deep behind him and a cry before his own thought drove him like a goad dry clash 'd his harness in the icy caves and barren chasms and all to left and right the bare black cliff clang 'd round him as he based his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— and on a sudden lo the level lake and the long glories of the winter moon then saw they how there hove a dusky barge dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern beneath them and descending they were ware that all the decks were dense with stately forms black-stoled black-hooded like a dream—by these three queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose a cry that shiver 'd to the tingling stars and as it were one voice an agony of lamentation like a wind that shrills all night in a waste land where no one comes or hath come since the making of the world then murmur 'd arthur `` place me in the barge '' and to the barge they came there those three queens put forth their hands and took the king and wept but she that rose the tallest of them all and fairest laid his head upon her lap and loosed the shatter 'd casque and chafed his hands and call 'd him by his name complaining loud and dropping bitter tears against his brow striped with dark blood for all his face was white and colourless and like the wither 'd moon smote by the fresh beam of the springing east and all his greaves and cuisses dash 'd with drops of onset and the light and lustrous curls— that made his forehead like a rising sun high from the daïs-throne—were parch 'd with dust or clotted into points and hanging loose mix 'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips so like a shatter 'd column lay the king not like that arthur who with lance in rest from spur to plume a star of tournament shot thro the lists at camelot and charged before the eyes of ladies and of kings then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere '' ah my lord arthur whither shall i go where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes for now i see the true old times are dead when every morning brought a noble chance and every chance brought out a noble knight such times have been not since the light that led the holy elders with the gift of myrrh but now the whole round table is dissolved which was an image of the mighty world and i the last go forth companionless and the days darken round me and the years among new men strange faces other minds '' and slowly answer 'd arthur from the barge '' the old order changeth yielding place to new and god fulfils himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world comfort thyself what comfort is in me i have lived my life and that which i have done may he within himself make pure but thou if thou shouldst never see my face again pray for my soul more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of wherefore let thy voice rise like a fountain for me night and day for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend for so the whole round earth is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of god but now farewell i am going a long way with these thou seëst—if indeed i go— for all my mind is clouded with a doubt to the island-valley of avilion where falls not hail or rain or any snow nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies deep-meadow 'd happy fair with orchard-lawns and bowery hollows crown 'd with summer sea where i will heal me of my grievous wound '' so said he and the barge with oar and sail moved from the brink like some full-breasted swan that fluting a wild carol ere her death ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood with swarthy webs long stood sir bedivere revolving many memories till the hull look 'd one black dot against the verge of dawn and on the mere the wailing died away

that scraping of iron on iron when the wind rises what is it something the wind won ’ t quit with but drags back and forth sometimes faint far then suddenly close just beyond the screened door as if someone there squats in the dark honing his wares against my threshold half steel wire half metal wing nothing and anything might make this noise of saws and rasps a creaking and groaning of bone-growth or body-death marriages of rust or ore abraded tonight something bows that should not bend something stiffens that should slide something loose and not right rakes or forges itself all night

calm was the day and through the trembling air sweet breathing zephyrus did softly play a gentle spirit that lightly did delay hot titan 's beams which then did glister fair when i whose sullen care through discontent of my long fruitless stay in prince 's court and expectation vain of idle hopes which still do fly away like empty shadows did afflict my brain walked forth to ease my pain along

the flood thereby with goodly greenish locks all loose untied as each had been a bride and each one had a little wicker basket made of fine twigs entrailed curiously in which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket and with fine fingers cropt full featously the tender stalks on high of every sort which in that meadow grew they gathered some the violet pallid blue the little daisy that at evening closes the virgin lily and the primrose true with store of vermeil roses to deck their bridegrooms posies against the bridal day which was not long sweet thames run softly till i end my song

they came floating on the crystal flood whom when they saw they stood amazed still their wondering eyes to fill them seemed they never saw a sight so fair of fowls so lovely that they sure did deem them heavenly born or to be that same pair which through the sky draw venus silver team for sure they did not seem to be begot of any earthly seed but rather angels or of angels breed yet were they

the difficulty to think at the end of day when the shapeless shadow covers the sun and nothing is left except light on your fur— there was the cat slopping its milk all day fat cat red tongue green mind white milk and august the most peaceful month to be in the grass in the peacefullest time without that monument of cat the cat forgotten in the moon and to feel that the light is a rabbit-light in which everything is meant for you and nothing need be explained then there is nothing to think of it comes of itself and east rushes west and west rushes down no matter the grass is full and full of yourself the trees around are for you the whole of the wideness of night is for you a self that touches all edges you become a self that fills the four corners of night the red cat hides away in the fur-light and there you are humped high humped up you are humped higher and higher black as stone— you sit with your head like a carving in space and the little green cat is a bug in the grass

all the night sleep came not upon my eyelids shed not dew nor shook nor unclosed a feather yet with lips shut close and with eyes of iron stood and beheld me then to me so lying awake a vision came without sleep over the seas and touched me softly touched mine eyelids and lips and i too full of the vision saw the white implacable aphrodite saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled shine as fire of sunset on western waters saw the reluctant feet the straining plumes of the doves that drew her looking always looking with necks reverted back to lesbos back to the hills whereunder shone mitylene heard the flying feet of the loves behind her make a sudden thunder upon the waters as the thunder flung from the strong unclosing wings of a great wind so the goddess fled from her place with awful sound of feet and thunder of wings around her while behind a clamour of singing women severed the twilight ah the singing ah the delight the passion all the loves wept listening sick with anguish stood the crowned nine muses about apollo fear was upon them while the tenth sang wonderful things they knew not ah the tenth the lesbian the nine were silent none endured the sound of her song for weeping laurel by laurel faded all their crowns but about her forehead round her woven tresses and ashen temples white as dead snow paler than grass in summer ravaged with kisses shone a light of fire as a crown for ever yea almost the implacable aphrodite paused and almost wept such a song was that song yea by her name too called her saying `` turn to me o my sappho '' yet she turned her face from the loves she saw not tears for laughter darken immortal eyelids heard not about her fearful fitful wings of the doves departing saw not how the bosom of aphrodite shook with weeping saw not her shaken raiment saw not her hands wrung saw the lesbians kissing across their smitten lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of lute-strings mouth to mouth and hand upon hand her chosen fairer than all men only saw the beautiful lips and fingers full of songs and kisses and little whispers full of music only beheld among them soar as a bird soars newly fledged her visible song a marvel made of perfect sound and exceeding passion sweetly shapen terrible full of thunders clothed with the wind 's wings then rejoiced she laughing with love and scattered roses awful roses of holy blossom then the loves thronged sadly with hidden faces round aphrodite then the muses stricken at heart were silent yea the gods waxed pale such a song was that song all reluctant all with a fresh repulsion fled from before her all withdrew long since and the land was barren full of fruitless women and music only now perchance when winds are assuaged at sunset lulled at the dewfall by the grey sea-side unassuaged unheard of unbeloved unseen in the ebb of twilight ghosts of outcast women return lamenting purged not in lethe clothed about with flame and with tears and singing songs that move the heart of the shaken heaven songs that break the heart of the earth with pity hearing to hear them

a bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the malamute saloon the kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune back of the bar in a solo game sat dangerous dan mcgrew and watching his luck was his light-o'-love the lady that 's known as lou when out of the night which was fifty below and into the din and the glare there stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks dog-dirty and loaded for bear he looked like a man with a foot in the grave and scarcely the strength of a louse yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar and he called for drinks for the house there was none could place the stranger 's face though we searched ourselves for a clue but we drank his health and the last to drink was dangerous dan mcgrew there 's men that somehow just grip your eyes and hold them hard like a spell and such was he and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell with a face most hair and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done as he watered the green stuff in his glass and the drops fell one by one then i got to figgering who he was and wondering what he 'd do and i turned my head — and there watching him was the lady that 's known as lou his eyes went rubbering round the room and he seemed in a kind of daze till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze the rag-time kid was having a drink there was no one else on the stool so the stranger stumbles across the room and flops down there like a fool in a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and i saw him sway then he clutched the keys with his talon hands — my god but that man could play were you ever out in the great alone when the moon was awful clear and the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could hear with only the howl of a timber wolf and you camped there in the cold a half-dead thing in a stark dead world clean mad for the muck called gold while high overhead green yellow and red the north lights swept in bars — then you 've a hunch what the music meant hunger and night and the stars and hunger not of the belly kind that 's banished with bacon and beans but the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means for a fireside far from the cares that are four walls and a roof above but oh so cramful of cosy joy and crowned with a woman 's love — a woman dearer than all the world and true as heaven is true — god how ghastly she looks through her rouge — the lady that 's known as lou then on a sudden the music changed so soft that you scarce could hear but you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it once held dear that someone had stolen the woman you loved that her love was a devil 's lie that your guts were gone and the best for you was to crawl away and die 't was the crowning cry of a heart 's despair and it thrilled you through and through — '' i guess i 'll make it a spread misere '' said dangerous dan mcgrew the music almost died away ... then it burst like a pent-up flood and it seemed to say `` repay repay '' and my eyes were blind with blood the thought came back of an ancient wrong and it stung like a frozen lash and the lust awoke to kill to kill ... then the music stopped with a crash and the stranger turned and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way in a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and i saw him sway then his lips went in in a kind of grin and he spoke and his voice was calm and `` boys '' says he `` you do n't know me and none of you care a damn but i want to state and my words are straight and i 'll bet my poke they 're true that one of you is a hound of hell .and that one is dan mcgrew '' then i ducked my head and the lights went out and two guns blazed in the dark and a woman screamed and the lights went up and two men lay stiff and stark pitched on his head and pumped full of lead was dangerous dan mcgrew while the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady that 's known as lou these are the simple facts of the case and i guess i ought to know they say that the stranger was crazed with `` hooch '' and i 'm not denying it 's so i 'm not so wise as the lawyer guys but strictly between us two — the woman that kissed him and — pinched his poke — was the lady that 's known as lou
reptilian green the wrinkled throat green as a bough of yew the beard he bent his head and so i smote then for a thought my vision cleared the head dropped clean he rose and walked he fixed his fingers in the hair the head was unabashed and talked i understood what i must dare his flesh cut down arose and grew he bade me wait the season ’ s round and then when he had strength anew to meet him on his native ground the year declined and in his keep i passed in joy a thriving yule and whether waking or in sleep i lived in riot like a fool he beat the woods to bring me meat his lady like a forest vine grew in my arms the growth was sweet and yet what thoughtless force was mine by practice and conviction formed with ancient stubbornness ingrained although her body clung and swarmed my own identity remained her beauty lithe unholy pure took shapes that i had never known and had i once been insecure had grafted laurel in my bone and then since i had kept the trust had loved the lady yet was true the knight withheld his giant thrust and let me go with what i knew i left the green bark and the shade where growth was rapid thick and still i found a road that men had made and rested on a drying hill
southward with fleet of ice sailed the corsair death wild and gast blew the blast and the east-wind was his breath his lordly ships of ice glisten in the sun on each side like pennons wide flashing crystal streamlets run his sails of white sea-mist dripped with silver rain but where he passed there were cast leaden shadows o'er the main eastward from campobello sir humphrey gilbert sailed three days or more seaward he bore then alas the land-wind failed alas the land-wind failed and ice-cold grew the night and nevermore on sea or shore should sir humphrey see the light he sat upon the deck the book was in his hand '' do not fear heaven is as near '' he said `` by water as by land '' in the first watch of the night without a signal 's sound out of the sea mysteriously the fleet of death rose all around the moon and the evening star were hanging in the shrouds every mast as it passed seemed to rake the passing clouds they grappled with their prize at midnight black and cold as of a rock was the shock heavily the ground-swell rolled southward through day and dark they drift in cold embrace with mist and rain o'er the open main yet there seems no change of place southward forever southward they drift through dark and day and like a dream in the gulf-stream sinking vanish all away
stanza 1 from harmony from heav'nly harmony this universal frame began when nature underneath a heap of jarring atoms lay and could not heave her head the tuneful voice was heard from high arise ye more than dead then cold and hot and moist and dry in order to their stations leap and music 's pow'r obey from harmony from heav'nly harmony this universal frame began from harmony to harmony through all the compass of the notes it ran the diapason closing full in man stanza 2 what passion can not music raise and quell when jubal struck the corded shell his list'ning brethren stood around and wond'ring on their faces fell to worship that celestial sound less than a god they thought there could not dwell within the hollow of that shell that spoke so sweetly and so well what passion can not music raise and quell stanza 3 the trumpet 's loud clangor excites us to arms with shrill notes of anger and mortal alarms the double double double beat of the thund'ring drum cries hark the foes come charge charge 't is too late to retreat stanza 4 the soft complaining flute in dying notes discovers the woes of hopeless lovers whose dirge is whisper 'd by the warbling lute stanza 5 sharp violins proclaim their jealous pangs and desperation fury frantic indignation depth of pains and height of passion for the fair disdainful dame stanza 6 but oh what art can teach what human voice can reach the sacred organ 's praise notes inspiring holy love notes that wing their heav'nly ways to mend the choirs above stanza 7 orpheus could lead the savage race and trees unrooted left their place sequacious of the lyre but bright cecilia rais 'd the wonder high'r when to her organ vocal breath was giv'n an angel heard and straight appear'd mistaking earth for heav'n grand chorus as from the pow'r of sacred lays the spheres began to move and sung the great creator 's praise to all the bless 'd above so when the last and dreadful hour this crumbling pageant shall devour the trumpet shall be heard on high the dead shall live the living die and music shall untune the sky
we the fairies blithe and antic of dimensions not gigantic though the moonshine mostly keep us oft in orchards frisk and peep us stolen sweets are always sweeter stolen kisses much completer stolen looks are nice in chapels stolen stolen be your apples when to bed the world are bobbing then 's the time for orchard-robbing yet the fruit were scarce worth peeling were it not for stealing stealing
from henry viii orpheus with his lute made trees and the mountain tops that freeze bow themselves when he did sing to his music plants and flowers ever sprung as sun and showers there had made a lasting spring every thing that heard him play even the billows of the sea hung their heads and then lay by in sweet music is such art killing care and grief of heart fall asleep or hearing die
what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helen 's cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessèd shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart
through alpine meadows soft-suffused with rain where thick the crocus blows past the dark forges long disused the mule-track from saint laurent goes the bridge is cross 'd and slow we ride through forest up the mountain-side the autumnal evening darkens round the wind is up and drives the rain while hark far down with strangled sound doth the dead guier 's stream complain where that wet smoke among the woods over his boiling cauldron broods swift rush the spectral vapours white past limestone scars with ragged pines showing—then blotting from our sight — halt—through the cloud-drift something shines high in the valley wet and drear the huts of courrerie appear strike leftward cries our guide and higher mounts up the stony forest-way at last the encircling trees retire look through the showery twilight grey what pointed roofs are these advance — a palace of the kings of france approach for what we seek is here alight and sparely sup and wait for rest in this outbuilding near then cross the sward and reach that gate knock pass the wicket thou art come to the carthusians world-famed home the silent courts where night and day into their stone-carved basins cold the splashing icy fountains play— the humid corridors behold where ghostlike in the deepening night cowl 'd forms brush by in gleaming white the chapel where no organ 's peal invests the stern and naked prayer— with penitential cries they kneel and wrestle rising then with bare and white uplifted faces stand passing the host from hand to hand each takes and then his visage wan is buried in his cowl once more the cells —the suffering son of man upon the wall—the knee-worn floor— and where they sleep that wooden bed which shall their coffin be when dead the library where tract and tome not to feed priestly pride are there to hymn the conquering march of rome nor yet to amuse as ours are they paint of souls the inner strife their drops of blood their death in life the garden overgrown—yet mild see fragrant herbs are flowering there strong children of the alpine wild whose culture is the brethren 's care of human tasks their only one and cheerful works beneath the sun those halls too destined to contain each its own pilgrim-host of old from england germany or spain— all are before me i behold the house the brotherhood austere —and what am i that i am here for rigorous teachers seized my youth and purged its faith and trimm 'd its fire show 'd me the high white star of truth there bade me gaze and there aspire even now their whispers pierce the gloom what dost thou in this living tomb forgive me masters of the mind at whose behest i long ago so much unlearnt so much resign'd— i come not here to be your foe i seek these anchorites not in ruth to curse and to deny your truth not as their friend or child i speak but as on some far northern strand thinking of his own gods a greek in pity and mournful awe might stand before some fallen runic stone— for both were faiths and both are gone wandering between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born with nowhere yet to rest my head like these on earth i wait forlorn their faith my tears the world deride— i come to shed them at their side oh hide me in your gloom profound ye solemn seats of holy pain take me cowl 'd forms and fence me round till i possess my soul again till free my thoughts before me roll not chafed by hourly false control for the world cries your faith is now but a dead time 's exploded dream my melancholy sciolists say is a pass 'd mode an outworn theme— as if the world had ever had a faith or sciolists been sad ah if it be pass 'd take away at least the restlessness the pain be man henceforth no more a prey to these out-dated stings again the nobleness of grief is gone ah leave us not the fret alone but—if you can not give us ease— last of the race of them who grieve here leave us to die out with these last of the people who believe silent while years engrave the brow silent—the best are silent now achilles ponders in his tent the kings of modern thought are dumb silent they are though not content and wait to see the future come they have the grief men had of yore but they contend and cry no more our fathers water 'd with their tears this sea of time whereon we sail their voices were in all men 's ears we pass 'd within their puissant hail still the same ocean round us raves but we stand mute and watch the waves for what avail 'd it all the noise and outcry of the former men — say have their sons achieved more joys say is life lighter now than then the sufferers died they left their pain— the pangs which tortured them remain what helps it now that byron bore with haughty scorn which mock 'd the smart through europe to the ætolian shore the pageant of his bleeding heart that thousands counted every groan and europe made his woe her own what boots it shelley that the breeze carried thy lovely wail away musical through italian trees which fringe thy soft blue spezzian bay inheritors of thy distress have restless hearts one throb the less or are we easier to have read o obermann the sad stern page which tells us how thou hidd'st thy head from the fierce tempest of thine age in the lone brakes of fontainebleau or chalets near the alpine snow ye slumber in your silent grave — the world which for an idle day grace to your mood of sadness gave long since hath flung her weeds away the eternal trifler breaks your spell but we—we learned your lore too well years hence perhaps may dawn an age more fortunate alas than we which without hardness will be sage and gay without frivolity sons of the world oh speed those years but while we wait allow our tears allow them we admire with awe the exulting thunder of your race you give the universe your law you triumph over time and space your pride of life your tireless powers we laud them but they are not ours we are like children rear 'd in shade beneath some old-world abbey wall forgotten in a forest-glade and secret from the eyes of all deep deep the greenwood round them waves their abbey and its close of graves but where the road runs near the stream oft through the trees they catch a glance of passing troops in the sun 's beam— pennon and plume and flashing lance forth to the world those soldiers fare to life to cities and to war and through the wood another way faint bugle-notes from far are borne where hunters gather staghounds bay round some fair forest-lodge at morn gay dames are there in sylvan green laughter and cries—those notes between the banners flashing through the trees make their blood dance and chain their eyes that bugle-music on the breeze arrests them with a charm 'd surprise banner by turns and bugle woo ye shy recluses follow too o children what do ye reply — '' action and pleasure will ye roam through these secluded dells to cry and call us —but too late ye come too late for us your call ye blow whose bent was taken long ago `` long since we pace this shadow 'd nave we watch those yellow tapers shine emblems of hope over the grave in the high altar 's depth divine the organ carries to our ear its accents of another sphere `` fenced early in this cloistral round of reverie of shade of prayer how should we grow in other ground how can we flower in foreign air —pass banners pass and bugles cease and leave our desert to its peace ''

well honest john how fare you now at home the spring is come and birds are building nests the old cock-robin to the sty is come with olive feathers and its ruddy breast and the old cock with wattles and red comb struts with the hens and seems to like some best then crows and looks about for little crumbs swept out by little folks an hour ago the pigs sleep in the sty the bookman comes— the little boy lets home-close nesting go and pockets tops and taws where daisies blow to look at the new number just laid down with lots of pictures and good stories too and jack the giant-killer 's high renown

they are not angels though they have the hollow look of beings bred on ether there ’ s an air of cool removal from your life the hawk ’ s indifference to the hare ’ s terror you see it in their palms raised casually against the fresco ’ s surface as to glass of submarine or spacecraft and you see it in their eyes oracular that let you pass alone to unknown agony the song they sing is merely time

pindar poet of the victories fitted names and legends into verses for the chorus to sing names recalled now only in the poems of pindar o nearly unpronounceable immortals in the dash oionos was champion oionos likmynios 's son who came from midea in wrestling echemos won—the name of his home city tegea proclaimed to the crowds doryklos of tiryns won the prize in boxing and the record for a four-horse team was set by samos from mantinea halirothios 's son and pindar poet of the olympian and isthmian and pythian games wrote also of the boundless and forgetful savannas of time what is someone the chorus sing in a victory ode—what is a nobody creatures of a day they chant in answer creatures of a day so where is the godgiven glory pindar says settles on mortals —bright as gold among the substances say the chorus paramount as water among the elements not in the victory itself petty or great of rich young greeks contending in games not in the poetry itself with its forgotten dances and pindar spinning among tiresome or stirring myths and genealogies the chanted names of cities and invoked gods and dignitaries— striving o nearly unpronounceable athletes to animate the air with dancing feet raising a golden pollen of dust a pervasive blur of seedlets in the sunlight whirling—beyond mere victory or applause or performance as victory is beyond defeat the one who threw the javelin furthest sang the chorus chanting pindar 's incantation against envy and oblivion was phrastor and when nikeus grunting whirled the stone into the air and it flew past the marks of all the competitors nikeus 's countrymen shouted his name after it nikeus nikeus and the syllables so say the lines pindar composed for the sweating chorus to chant—radiated for a spell like the silvery mirror of the moon
on some fundless expedition you discover it beneath a pyracantha bush carved from the hip bone of a long-extinct herbivore that walked the plains on legs a story tall an ocarina of bone drilled and shaped laboriously with tools too soft to be efficient by one primitive musician spending night after night squatting by the fire no instrument of percussion place this against your lips fill it from your lungs to sound a note winding double helix solo and thready calling to the pack
life 's spell is so exquisite everything conspires to break it emily dickinson it was n't bliss what was bliss but the ordinary life she 'd spend hours in patter moving through whole days touching sniffing tasting exquisite housekeeping in a charmed world and yet there was always more of the same all that happiness the aimless being there so she wandered for a while bush to arbor lingered to look through a pond 's restive mirror he was off cataloging the universe probably pretending he could organize what was clearly someone else 's chaos that 's when she found the tree the dark crabbed branches bearing up such speechless bounty she knew without being told this was forbidden it wasn't a question of ownership— who could lay claim to such maddening perfection and there was no voice in her head no whispered intelligence lurking in the leaves—just an ache that grew until she knew she 'd already lost everything except desire the red heft of it warming her outstretched palm
easter was the old north goddess of the dawn she rises daily in the east and yearly in spring for the great paschal candle of the sun her name lingers like a spot of gravy in the figured vestment of the language of the britains her totem the randy bunny our very thursdays and wednesdays are stained by syllables of thunder and woden 's frenzy o my fellow-patriots loyal to this our modern world of high heels vaccination brain surgery— may they pass over us the old jovial raptors apollonian flayers embodiments egg-hunt crucifixion supper of encrypted dishes bitter unrisen a platter compass of martyrdom ground-up apples and walnuts in sweet wine to embody mortar of affliction babies for bricks legible traces of the species that devises the angel of death sailing over our doorpost smeared with sacrifice
george borrow in his lavengro tells us of a welshman who by some excess of mother-wit framed a harp and played on it built a ship and sailed to sea and steered it home to melody of his own making i indeed might write for everyman to read a thaumalogue of wonderment more wonderful but rest content with celebrating one i knew who built his pipes and played them too no more ah played therein is all the hounded thing the hunter 's call the shudder when the quarry 's breath is drowned in blood and stilled in death the marriage dance the pulsing vein the kiss that must be given again the hope that ireland like a rose sees shining thro her tale of woes the battle lost the long lament for blood and spirit vainly spent and so on thro the varying scale of passion that the western gael knows and by miracle of art draws to the chanter from the heart like water from a hidden spring to leap or murmur weep or sing i see him now a little man in proper black whey-bearded wan with eyes that scan the eastern hills thro thick gold-rimmèd spectacles his hand is on the chanter lo the hidden spring begins to flow in waves of magic he is dead these seven years but bend your head and listen rising from the clay the master plays the ring of day it mounts and falls and floats away over the sky-line then is gone into the silence of the dawn
that child was dangerous that just-born newly washed and silent baby wrapped in deerskin and held warm against the side of its mother could understand the language of birds and animals even when asleep it knew why bluejay was scolding the bushes what hawk was explaining to the wind on the cliffside what bittern had found out while standing alone in marsh grass it knew what the screams of fox and the whistling of otter were telling the forest that child knew the language of fire as it gnawed at sticks like beaver and what water said all day and all night at the creek 's mouth as its small fingers closed around stone it held what stone was saying it knew what bear mother whispered to herself under the snow it could not tell anyone what it knew it would laugh or cry out or startle or suddenly stare at nothing but had no way to repeat what it was hearing what it wanted most not to remember it had no way to know why it would fall under a spell and lie still as if not breathing having grown afraid of what it could understand that child would learn to sit and crawl and stand and begin putting one foot forward and following it with the other would learn to put one word it could barely remember slightly ahead of the other and then walk and speak and finally run and chatter and all the tillamook would know that child had forgotten everything and at last could listen only to people and was safe now
because someone thirsty enough to trust old testament wisdom followed the deepening greens and found a spring silver in the shadow of blue ridges i can kneel beneath this spill of willow limbs a century later and drink water risen from roots to enter the evening through a spout the way cherokee stories say the first people were born washing into the world of such trees whose bark like the water i cup to my parched mouth tastes leafy and sweet and has the power the old ones say to heal
the inside out mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins muscles the bits of fat at her belly her small gray spleen at first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside she 's the ultimate open book he can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she 's lying poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm no need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood he just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder but before long she starts to sense that her lover like all the others before him is getting restless this is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness as a last resort she ’ ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him but eventually he ’ ll become convinced she ’ s hiding things from him and she is her perfect skin her long black hair her red mouth never chapped from exposure to sun or wind how she secretly loves that he can ’ t touch her here or here
when my hole-punch drizzles tiny paper circles onto the carpet my wolf sister moans and bites it covering her ears with her paws i think she ’ s tired of the moon she takes a stack of dinner plates from my cupboard and slinks off to the park to break them our brother shows up a week later collapses on the sofa like a fur throw why have they come here when everything i do is wrong they howl in the shower together but the water doesn ’ t mask the sound i go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets–i know there ’ ll be water all over–but the room is bone dry maybe this time things will be different i hide the home movies in case they ask for them in the one i always watch there ’ s some wobbly footage of the sky then my father lowers the camera ’ s eye to mother teaching my sister and brother to “ tell time. ” they ’ re following a mother hare on her sunset rounds–one leveret mouthful at 12 o ’ clock another at 3 6 9. then the camera zooms in on me–i ’ ve spat out my pacifier made of fur and i ’ m on the porch surrounded by bonsai trees killing or saving barbie
we were made to understand it would be terrible every small want every niggling urge every hate swollen to a kind of epic wind livid the land and ravaged like a rageful dream the worst of us having taken over and broken the rest utterly down a long age passed when at last we knew how little would survive us—how little we had mended or built that was not now lost—something large and old awoke and then our singing brought on a different manner of weather then animals long believed gone crept down from trees we took new stock of one another we wept to be reminded of such color
