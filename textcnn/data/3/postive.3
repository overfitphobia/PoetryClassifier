though i have never caught the word of god from any calling bird i hear all that the ancients heard though i have seen no deity enter or leave a twilit tree i see all that the seers see a common stone can still reveal something not stone not seen yet real what may a common stone conceal nothing is far that once was near nothing is hid that once was clear nothing was god that is not here here is the bird the tree the stone here in the sun i sit alone between the known and the unknown
i saw then the white-eyed man leaning in to see if i was ready yet to go where he has been waiting to take me i saw then the gnawing sounds my faith has been making and i saw too that the shape it sings in is the color of cast-iron mountains i drove so long to find i forgot i had been looking for them for the you i once knew and the you that was born waiting for me to find you i have been twisting and turning across these lifetimes where forgetting me is what you do so you don ’ t have to look at yourself i saw that i would drown in a creek carved out of a field our incarnations forged the first path through to those mountains i invited you to stroll with me there again for the first time to pause and sprawl in the grass while i read to you the poem you hadn ’ t known you ’ d been waiting to hear i read until you finally slept and all your jagged syntaxes softened into rest you ’ re always driving so far from me towards the me i worry without you is eternity i lay there awake keeping watch while you snored i waited as i always seem to for you to wake up and come back to me
the subtlest strain a great musician weaves can not attain in rhythmic harmony to music in his soul may it not be celestial lyres send hints to him he grieves that half the sweetness of the song he leaves unheard in the transition thus do we yearn to translate the wondrous majesty of some rare mood when the rapt soul receives a vision exquisite yet who can match the sunset ’ s iridescent hues who sing the skylark ’ s ecstasy so seraph-fine we struggle vainly still we fain would catch such rifts amid life ’ s shadows for they bring glimpses ineffable of things divine

well yes i said my mother wears a dot i know they said `` third eye '' in class but it 's not an eye eye not like that it 's not some freak third eye that opens on your forehead like on some chernobyl baby what it means is what it 's showing is there 's this unseen eye on the inside and she 's marking it it 's how the x that says where treasure 's at is not the treasure but as good as treasure.— all right what i said was n't half so measured in fact i did n't say a thing their laughter had made my mouth go dry lunch was after world history that week was india—myths caste system suttee all the greatest hits the white kids i was sitting with were friends at least as i defined a friend back then so wait said nick does your mom wear a dot i nodded and i caught a smirk on todd— she wear it to the shower and to bed — whie jesse sucked his chocolate milk and brad was getting ready for another stab i said hand me that ketchup packet there and nick said what i snatched it twitched the tear and squeezed a dollop on my thumb and worked circles till the red planet entered the house of war and on my forehead for the world to see my third eye burned those schoolboys in their seats their flesh in little puddles underneath pale pools where nataraja cooled his feet
say what you like about charaxos that ’ s a fellow with a fat-bellied ship always in some port or other what does zeus care or the rest of his gang now you ’ d like me on my knees crying out to hera “ blah blah blah bring him home safe and free of warts ” or blubbering “ wah wah wah thank you thank you for curing my liver condition. ” good grief gods do what they like they call down hurricanes with a whisper or send off a tsunami the way you would a love letter if they have a whim they make some henchmen fix it up like those idiots in the iliad a puff of smoke a little fog away goes the hero it ’ s happily ever after as for larichos that lay-a-bed lives for the pillow if for once he ’ d get off his ass he might make something of himself then from that reeking sewer of my life i might haul up a bucket of spring water translated from the greek
i have never needed god as a personal savior in my practical life syllogisms about his existence were never music to my ears but always seemed vague missing a dimension although i didn ’ t know how to say this neither a philosophical god nor a biblical god suddenly appears among his creations amid revelations of wisdom in jerusalem his city and certainly not in disclosures of pious inner principles and also not among poets unfortunately astronomical bodies at night and mystical landscapes in sharafat for example and beit jala bear his between-the-lines existence his inklings the expression of an ultra-orthodox man ’ s eyes in mea she ’ arim — this too — and even the purifying surrender of a sly and seasoned merchant irreligious now in geula when you reproach him something like “ reprove a wise man and he will love you. ” and you when you cleanse yourself of anxious constraints about your environment after taking hash or grass springs of purity whose origins you ’ re unaware of bubble in coursing blood in glands in milk and some paradisiacal primeval revelation and your almost subconscious innerness your being suddenly revealed — is this clear enough to you heredity genes or existential uniqueness a maintained infancy that knocks you out with a sense of a refreshing genesis everything becomes clear in a great light you shed revulsion and resistance a great love germinates within you — this gloriousness this wonder comprised of absolutes of — objective truth complete justice decency honor internalized honesty and complex wisdom enhanced down to the last detail ho complete divine purity suddenly you polish a syllogism of your own for decisive proof of his existence god is an idea — ideas don ’ t have material existence but they exist nonetheless so god exists definitively as the spirit of an idea the biblical assertion “ he has no body and no bodily form ” is clear to me now as an exegesis that sits well with philosophy translated from the hebrew

and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother ’ s keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother ’ s blood crieth unto me from the ground and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother ’ s blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth genesis 4:9–12
cain tended to break rules and saving the introduction of a principal character for episode 3 was the most signifcant early decision previously associated with both cain and fr k adah had been away on a busi- ness trip for three months returning to find diplomatic relations between her country and its bellicose neighbor in tatters staff writer james ingram recalls the atmosphere in the room when they realized that the letters b i t c h d i t t o were left over after fr k ’ s feverish definitions “ we just started opening windows and whooping at the world ” he says “ it was character defining this was adah in her own words wresting control idiot with her whatever i ’ ve i ’ m probably that. ” not unlike accident ” of later punctuation free-for-all we that the writers signifcance of a coincidence charged with a hysterical joint the male leads desires for adah name her with back from the first breath worked on since proudest of the famous “ b- season favorite is naturally a may reflect now overlooked the so terrifying the episode is sexual tension chorus from their hopes and their need to many names doorbell. adah in burberry bathed in hall light adah rosebud torturer co-author of overset thermometers adah outshining hydrogen trinketry soothe their wrathful orphanhood then come hither nutrient heavyweight statuette handbook for esh data vat theft the lighthouse den where redemption inducts honey brunette a.d.d. ol ’ mouthwash adahhhh tetchy demon conventional frenchwoman death wishbone horse- shoe “ ditto bitch. ” to take ownership of her in some way or in one very specific way indeed there is an unabashed eroticism to the episode albeit entirely set in the corridor which saw early accusations of gratuity the show would grow accustomed to courting controversy in this way occasionally falling foul of the bechdel test a scene cut from episode 12 featured adah in conversation with herself about the two male leads for half an hour halberg remains impenitent “ adah isn ’ t just the love interest — that ’ s exactly what we wanted to send up in this show she ’ s supposed to be the rudder the only one with a handle on the situation who might do something about it of course cain and father k just spend the whole time drooling and lusting after her they ’ re imbeciles ”
but not before several undisputed stone-cold classics this is why we keep writing about cain for all its self-indulgent flaws it just gets it so right sometimes every standard element is here the gang is still drinking far too many cocktails in one sitting cain is a hypocrite adah exists only to be interpreted by the men father k is so borderline incoherent you almost wonder if he ’ s a malfunctioning robot so what ’ s changed i think it ’ s the widening of the lens the micro to the macro by this point they ’ ve all pretty much given up on their evening away from the overthrew and ing it in ruins puppet-board of means we can at what is hap- city and it ’ s not demilitarized to confirm the word as bond grinding their with the recog- cial authorities is classes walking university they took over leav- with a useless directors this look once again pening to their good officially this only stands emptiness of everyone is teeth reasoning nized or unoffi- like attempting cain though broadsheet in dialogue harbors tabloid thoughts a doughnut of prurience i had adah misconstrued 5th/6th manhattan t/k her worth her “ no tent ” theme the red toothbrush threshing deconsecrated earth boycotted labyrinths hot thin chef overworked an- tihero of the bathysphere i need you to be yourself today thoth went font-born on farmland the mortar swiveled on the hill demilitarized huh oh how vehe- ment heavenward to plough a field with a toothbrush the overworked chef had finally produced something delicious and this week at least it was a labyrinth we didn ’ t want to boycott t/k is journalistic shorthand for “ to come ” indicating a forthcoming addition to the text tk is a rare formation of letters and therefore would not be confused with continuous language as “ to come ” might thoth one of the gods of the egyptian pantheon has either an ibis or a baboon head arbitrator of disputes between other gods and the system of writing
an extremely hubristic unflattering and accurate self-portrait this episode saw halberg in direct conversa- tion with cain questioning his own methods the passing allusion to pushkin ’ s eugene onegin appears to reference chapter 4 stanza xxxv “ but i myself read my bedizened /fancies my rhythmic search for truth /to nobody except a wizened /nanny companion of my youth /or after some dull dinner ’ s labour i buttonhole a wandering neighbour /and in a corner make him choke /on tragedy but it ’ s no joke /when utterly worn out hausted and i take /a beside my get up with ing/alarmed by lay /they leave fly away. ” there able system of the show which not discuss appears to be the is a geometric to euclidean by rhyming /ex- done up rambling walk lake /and duck instant tim- my melodious their shores and is an unfathom- numbers within halberg will but episode 25 key an orthant term referring n-dimensional i could close the deal with my brattish coauthor harry reputation ’ s toreador or detonate the whole trenchant un- fathomable bandwidth thumb-horned orthant the bits where pushkin ’ s like ughhhh rhymes and goes for a beer can ’ t unread the footnote is this worthwhile am i oh shanghaied heart- throb thirteenth dandy havoc-hound gentrify the favela runt or defend the loon sod the chrome t-totum ever the bodybuilder even in ghosthood space the analogue of a quadrant 2d or an octant 3d thumb-horned has the feel of an order of mockery /cuckoldry but may also be a reference to cain ’ s mark according to some scholars being the gradual protrusion of horns a t-totum or teetotum is a little metal roman spinning top used for gambling william ernest henley ’ s “ the double ballade on the nothingness of things ” opens with the lines “ the big teetotum twirls /and epochs wax and wane /as chance subsides or swirls ... ” triskaidekaphobia can be traced back to the zoroastrianism of ancient persia where the 13th day of each new year is considered evil or a day when the power of evil is particularly intense and can cause trouble thus to this day people leave cities and camp overnight in the countryside god has thirteen attributes of mercy according to rabbinic commentary on the torah and thirteen is also the number of nodes which make up metatron ’ s cube in kabbalistic account metatron is an extraordinarily important angel in the apocryphal book of the palaces it is suggested that metatron is the only reason the human race was given knowledge of god and the cube forms a kind of “ map of creation. ” this appears to relate back to the “ rhombohedral monolith ” of the early episodes the college ’ s strange obelisks it is worth mentioning that euclidean spaces generalize to higher dimensions i feel really weird

in dogma is the secret that renders god unconditioned on one condition “ if you are not my people i am not your god. ” as fashioned by his people 's witness a made thing god condemns the made things graven images are inscribed as born wittingly of himself god is so to speak that father abler than the most sovereign earthly father to make all things good god the father is conceived as for us purposive stewarding benign he covenants our living on “ written in continuance ” in his book before they took form were the parts of our fitful bodies as if what's given with the world is life only life and not along with it in time at last life 's needful withdrawal god 's said to let the truthful keep their lives forever if they swear god does what he says these are the portions either i 'll outlast death or it me little matter which if it 's the avowed god i 'm given up to that i 'm settled in the finite is what 's true instead living is a good i do n't want stopped even for the saved i 'm beholden to it all the way that in its one chance each with me and others death has n't used itself up yet mine affords me another day hours before it 's light along with the caused things outside that i ca n't see i 'm here ahead of myself again toward that coupling with the ground when “ i am poured out like water. ” death 's still to be heard from at its least reserved under its breath it primes me to pay up and look pleasant

so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded — ezekiel 24:18 she is approaching him god he sees her in his eye-edge a tiny gold speck getting bigger scintillating her beauty lashes him with its sword — but she has heard all this before she approaches him the one who killed her and she reeks of life he waits for her to dissolve in him but her grit encircles his teeth he waits for her to become what he has made her an angel passionate and cold as the dawn quietly encased in power churning out neutral love and fastened to eternity backwards and forwards all the days but the world is tangled in her hair she is getting closer and her gold beauty is greening her face is turning furious fury-like her death opens around him and he feels a human fear he can not match her she has the reins of creation in her slim white paws he feels the world creeping away from him he makes to shove her from heaven let her slip and slumber through the world but he can not grip her she gleams through him like heaven through a needle the stroll god takes ezekiel for many walks he talks about all the things he will do to the people this and this and this and then they will know who i am one day they chance upon a valley of bones splintering and whitening in the sun shall these bones live these bones oh lord god flings sinew on the bones liver spleen gristle the bodies rise rise without breath wet clay glistens in the sun he gives breath as if an afterthought ezekiel tries to see in their eyes one at a time the men not moving but lunging forward like warriors eyes ice cold mud seen through mist waiting for their souls to snap back in they are bruised with an ache made not by the world their forgotten stories rift their faces their deaths now a hole they can walk through home a space that closed after them rinsed of the mourning that ran its course they glimmer in new reality still speechless as if they were really the miracle ... but already god has taken ezekiel by the elbow

or is it on account of my radiant eye i have lived so long —i never slept in the study hall or called anyone by an improper name i never urinated in a desolate synagogue i never ate or drank in a desolate synagogue or picked my teeth i did not walk into a desolate synagogue in the summer just because of the heat nor in winter just because of cold rain also i know one may not deliver a eulogy for an individual inside a desolate synagogue but you can read scripture inside a desolate synagogue or you can teach in a desolate synagogue or deliver eulogies for the community when synagogues are deserted they are to be left alone and weeds allowed to grow one should not pick the weeds lest there be anguish that the synagogue is in ruins when are the synagogues to be swept so that weeds do not grow inside them when they are in use.—when synagogues are in ruins weeds are not to be picked there because i know these things i was approved although unworthy after a three-day oral examination before the king of sicily to whom by custom the power of approval is entrusted thereafter i have worn the laurel crown—my eye radiant to this day

ashen face wool hat bobbing the young boy ’ s eyes dart to me then up at the man pulling a rolling suitcase whose hand he holds then back at me his legs move as if without gravity the man asks do you know a church on this street that serves free food i want to say i know that the names of churches on an avenue called americas roll out of me i want to tell you it is temporary their condition suitcase darting eyes seeking free food at 9 pm in a big city on a school night i want to tell you i don ’ t for a moment wonder if that is really the boy ’ s father or uncle or legitimate caretaker — something in the handholding and eyes having watched too many episodes of law and order i want to tell you i take them to a restaurant and pay for a warm meal or empty my wallet not worrying how offensive that might be because in the end hunger is hunger i want to tell you i call someone who loves them — that there is someone — and say your guys are lost can you come i want to tell you i sit down on the sidewalk at the corner of waverly and pray — that all passing by anonymous shoes marking the pavement join in a chorus of prayer humming like cicadas in the delta i want to tell you the boy and the man eat food encircled by the warmth of bodies i want to turn the cold night into a feast i will tell you i am praying

calm appeared his soul stopped a crow staring as he snatched down miniature angels trapped them in jars capping the light away to make a hush out of glory songs a crying out from the joyful aubades they breathe as easy as moonlight on jars of preserves their throats full of fear now the brave breast crumpled in his child fingers their prisons invisible to the cherubim searching for heaven 's missing songsters trapped in blind ways of getting even at a world that would make him small make him an impotent wonder curl his genius under like a witch 's toes when his father died chewing on cheese and cornbread chocolate surprise in the sun an unkind ending he grew in the way of genius no charts showing where he ended and the world began how cities figure in the jagged sweep of cornfields endless thousands of shouts up into the evening listening to the future speaking like the old man in the schoolyard a stranger by the wishing pond in the woods or dogs that stand up like men in hats— these the corinthian signs he mistook for an alphabet giving the right to molest children now wisdom is sour rubbing medicine pasted over nightmares not the proper wealth of an old man the arms of his neighbors around him like laurels
for hsing hui a thing as delicious as turning the last sound i heard into a word it can not be or calling your hidden wish out into the broad space of the public to make you touch me instead of asking that i go naked a thing as delicious as any of that would not be as safe as a dumb silence i am resting my back with a cushion against the chair sitting inside the ache when i soaked myself in a balm the way women went to the river and held things down until they were as wet as jesus hanging in the rain his pain the invocation of roars destroying the temple the things i know are not the things you wish to know or they are and i can not give them to you until i see what you think of contracts of what binds the mornings to unkind sunlight what takes a hawk and lets it know there are things less grand than flying things that crave
he lowered his head and darted through the grass flushing a hen from off her nest then zeroing in on the day-old chicks instead of the mother whose decoy trick had failed to lure him away in the time it took for me to notice this he 'd broken the necks of two of the chicks and torn the skin from off their backs and heads the taste of their blood had deafened him to my commands so i went to him like an angry god and chased him away with my staff and rod inflicting a wound also in his side for him to go on licking to wash their blood from off his tongue with his own blood and then i kneeled in the grass to regard his kill while the mother keened inside the woods not far away oh what a mess they were with their heads snapped back and wings unhinged i picked up the bodies like bloody socks and prayed to the god in charge of this field for my own weakness to feel this much for slaughtered chicks for an understanding of his need to kill the most vulnerable thing whether hungry or not
i.m marty crickard i came to light a candle for a friend but jesus had a really bad mustache and those were only pinpricks in his palms so i passed on i came to light a candle for a friend but joseph ’ s hands were manicured and soft as fairy liquid hands i could not light one there so i passed on in the corner was a fellow with a cowled robe and a tonsure like a saucer — he palmed a young and curly blonde adonis — so i passed on then to benoît-joseph labre a tattered man whose wide eyes blazed he looked quite mad had beggar ’ s hands i liked him i lit two dozen candles didn ’ t pay and nicked this book on him before i left i did all this in honor of my matchless absent friend whose honest calloused workman ’ s hands maintained the half of belfast and nothing ’ s been the same since he passed on

before it disappears on the sand his long white beard before it disappears the face of the man in the waves i ask her does she see it ask her does the old man in the waves as the waves crest she see it does she see the old man his white his face crumbling face it looks as old as he ’ s as old as the ocean looks and for a moment almost looks his face like it ’ s all the way him as never such old skin looks my daughter age four she thinks it might he might be real she shouts hello and after there ’ s no answer answers no

i hope the only reason that i am this pre-autumn afternoon in the privacy of my suspicious living room grant myself permission to believe in god once again is solely because i saw an unexpected grasshopper staring at my thoughts on the table that keeps the telephone from having a mind of its very own at first i was startled and then i was startled less at the sight of this insect put together in green details to pay me an afternoon visit 39 floors above floor level in my high rise hobo apartment miracle on 53rd street grasshopper hopped all the way 39 floors above floor level to deliberately invade my privacy and i did n't mind at all after grasshopper assured me it did n't speak english or spanish or chinese with an italian accent so we hit it off right away you mind your own business and i will not ask you any personal questions aside from how the hell did you get here i 've never written a poem about grasshoppers this high up before and i know it was n't something my non existing paint brushes conceived behind my back and the only grass i have here is to smoke not hop around in until i get dizzy and levitate there has to be a mistake or did the grasshopper take the elevator to the 39th floor and enter my apartment without knocking to make it obvious grasshoppers have the right to remain silent also and give credit to the desert for his arrival and not no almighty the only other mystery capable

adapted from the original notebook fragment written by rainer maria rilke in spain in 1913. evidently this was needed because people need to be screamed at with proof but he knew his friends before they were he knew them and they knew that he would never leave them there desolate so he let his exhausted eyes close at first glimpse of the village fringed with tall fig trees — immediately he found himself in their midst here was martha sister of the dead boy he knew she would not stray as he knew which would he knew that he would always find her at his right hand and beside her her sister mary the one a whole world of whores still stood in a vast circle pointing at yes all were gathered around him and once again he began to explain to bewildered upturned faces where it was he had to go and why he called them “ my friends. ” the logos god ’ s creating word — the same voice that said let there be light yet when he opened his eyes he found himself standing apart even the two slowly backing away as though from concern for their good name then he began to hear voices whispering quite distinctly or thinking lord if you had been here our friend might not have died at that he slowly reached out as though to touch a face and soundlessly started to cry he asked them the way to the grave and he followed behind them preparing to do what is not done to that green silent place where life and death are one by then other brueghelian grotesques had gathered toothlessly sneering across at each other and stalled at some porpoise or pig stage of ontogenetical horrorshow keeping their own furtive shadowy distances and struggling to keep up like packs of limping dogs merely to walk down this road in broad daylight had begun to feel illegal unreal rehearsal test — but for what and the filth of desecration sifting down over him as a feverish outrage rose up contempt at the glib ease with which words like “ living ” and “ being dead ” rolled off their tongues and loathing flooded his body when he hoarsely cried “ move the stone ” “ by now the body must stink ” some helpfully suggested but it was true that the body had lain in its grave four days he heard the voice as if from far away beginning to fill with that gesture which rose through him no hand that heavy had ever reached this height shining an instant in air then all at once clenching and cramped — the fingers shrunk crookedly into themselves and irreparably fixed there like a hand with scars of ghastly slashing lacerations and the usual deep sawing across the wrist ’ s fret through all major nerves the frail hair-like nerves — so his hand at the thought all the dead might return from that tomb where the enormous cocoon of the corpse was beginning to stir yet nobody stood there — only the one young man pale as though bled stooping at the entrance and squinting at the light picking at his face loose strips of rotting shroud all that he could think of was a dark place to lie down and hide that wasted body and tears rolled up his cheek and back into his eyes and then his eyes began rolling back into his head ... peter looked across at jesus with an expression that seemed to say you did it or what have you done and everyone saw how their vague and inaccurate life made room for his once more
on sundays the preacher gives everyone a chance to repent their sins miss edna makes me go to church she wears a bright hat i wear my suit babies dress in lace girls my age some pretty some not so pretty old ladies and men nodding miss edna every now and then throwing her hand in the air saying yes lord and preach i sneak a pen from my back pocket bend down low like i dropped something the chorus marches up behind the preacher clapping and humming and getting ready to sing i write the word hope on my hand
when the kids in my class ask why i am not allowed to pledge to the flag i tell them it 's against my religion but do n't say i am in the world but not of the world this they would not understand even though my mother 's not a jehovah 's witness she makes us follow their rules and leave the classroom when the pledge is being said every morning i walk out with gina and alina the two other witnesses in my class sometimes gina says maybe we should pray for the kids inside who do n't know that god said '' no other idols before me '' that our god is a jealous god gina is a true believer her bible open during reading time but alina and i walk through our roles as witnesses as though this is the part we 've been given in a play and once offstage we run free sing '' america the beautiful '' and `` the star-spangled banner '' far away from our families—knowing every word alina and i want more than anything to walk back into our classroom press our hands against our hearts say '' i pledge allegiance '' loud without our jealous god looking down on us without our parents finding out without our mothers voices in our heads saying you are different chosen good when the pledge is over we walk single file back into the classroom take our separate seats alina and i far away from gina but gina always looks back at us—as if to say i 'm watching you as if to say i know
in the field — shepherd ’ s purse to be seen even in the dark think on it — after the gravel paths after the roads — uneven and achingly long across the cold promise the border makes to a sloping field to a ditch a ditch like any other a ditch i have known — since imagine them green slender from crown to root a rosette of radical leaves smooth arrow-shaped and above them numerous small white inconspicuous flowers there was no need to ask the man to kneel but he did as if he were going to beg forgiveness which he did not nor did he ask for his life he named his children and his wife murmured to his own private god overhead there was the sound of pine shifting the moon winnowing in the distance so nothing terrible about the night then if you do not count the earth tilting or the sound in the undergrowth of a passage from this world to the next more than that i remember the flat-seed pouch weed some call it as if to flourish and seed in the poorest soil is to be just that they are everywhere now — it seems to me populating my field of vision like a generative disease an affliction look a man walks into a field a field with shepherd ’ s purse he falls he falls again every day from this day until kingdom come he falls into the embrace of a field of flowers into shepherd ’ s purse
what might all songs lean into you scramble eggs one moment and in the next minute you 're eating them with dry toast and black coffee in silence on a day like any day your voice is not your own the grass clippings disrupt a robin too large to fly from worm to worm we do n't know why we speak but yet our voices persist even when void of substance— like a dream you 'd like to recall throughout the day but you do n't or you can't and after a week it 's gone forever of course our voices evolve years before our bodies— our vocal cords vibrate like a heartbeat senselessly no explanation needed eventually all languages converge each thought falls into all others and what thought resists being built by words perhaps fear placed us here in this room together a fear of fire at one point turned into a fear of god after that a fear of godlessness a room where a word before another word and another word after the first was all we had all we could imagine somehow an image means more than the object itself but not because it 's made of words most likely it 's because the act of creation sets the mind down like a bird in a field where the speed of the invasive can not exist
i a boy was covered in pigeons he put birdseed in his hair and crotch so the ghostbird would descend and devour him i saw the brown bird with the yellow breast smoking lucky strikes thought she might be the holy spirit there are no birds only what this typewriter flushes out the cliffs are made from stone doves and the boys had beautiful lips ii the outside suggests a tunnel to ride what he says through a tunnel geography animal life the eventual human being anatomy on the page is sexier my ghost the page of real thigh my mister opens at the top to be eaten like the sun you can recognize eats her rays greasy misery covers my hands it bothers me to touch a carcass dead branches bothers me iii god 's big eye is a pink cubicle god 's big eye stretches around me a great balled gown i look for him in the roots of the roofless space mons pubis corresponds to the real bird the lung the wing iv i demand the air beat the birds scared up into motion and i expect revelation i have my lusty knife left cigarettes on your grave and chant j is for jerusalem returns the poet to an invisible homeland resurrects the liver saying goodbye to a ghost is a hoax the birds are still in flight unhook the birds v sick orange sky i hate i shall see it opened the sunny aftertomb and a real poem at the gate the erratic footprints of birds upon the sand or lacerations no limbs at our disposal only the desire of limbs to reflesh the ghost gestures i am filling your borders with letters this is the new word—get up and live
god is not light upon light no more than goat is need upon need although there where it grazes it is sun upon coat within which ticks and stray-blown feed burrow into the pocked skin of such foul scent covering the underflesh heart that could eat this farmer 's grain or the barren mountain 's bark high in the solitude of sheer animal peace laid over sheer animal terror we ask the animal afflicted by its time its impoverished american meadow that drove it to find birch from which to strip its easy feed to abide with us it does not need us we think it needs us we must forgive god god 's story
under the gervais st. bridge our voices domed like a cathedral shoulders dipped in sunlight a baptism of sorts we came to take pictures searched for subjects like graffiti on piers what my mother calls angel rays in the sky that yellowed humid glint in your eyes maybe i ran out of film or my batteries died because when we finally found our shot you used your iphone neither of us have a right to decide what is holy i told you i was almost a catholic baby a half-lie i wanted to be true if only because i knew you would be disappointed there is no glory in either of our doubts your face when i talked of prayer how walking across that bridge back to your car i remembered that what gives a photo life is artificial light
his handkerchief a pin or coin he ’ d touched a button from his shirt a feather caught on his coattail — such tokens would fetch a price ... men came to shake his hand or rub their warts upon his famous skin young mothers held babies for him to bless with luck or wisdom — could he ward off the pox — while others pressed bribes for the questions they would have him ask one woman facing down a blush gave him a scrap of cloth and asked that he get blood on it she would return next day to pay him if he would care to nominate a fee ... blood of a witch can you believe such a thing i think you may be worldly after all boy that i was i can only guess at what he must have made of me and he tricked out in a high-crowned hat geneva cape staff spurs and bucket-top boots — he might have been a landed squire or country magistrate ... you think us credulous of course you do so young so quick to judge friend these were days of comets in the air various auguries marvellous tempests sights on the sea — that we might have a witch nesting among us was not the strangest news we heard proceedings would begin at dawn he said next day we found ourselves at the chapel house uncertain who had summoned whom it fell to me though why is more than i can say i had not then addressed a congregation to tell how ever since her husband ’ s death old bess had shunned society how week on week her vacant place in church would be remarked how she had made a stranger of herself so long that when she turned to her next neighbour begging a bowl of curds she was denied how she cursed him for this and how his child sickened and died soon afterwards i took my seat light-headed among murmurs of approval part of the crowd once more strange to myself for all my eloquence and some three-and-ninety witnesses rose to give their evidence ... but then “ ask not what mercy justice can afford until as civil law requires you hear the witch condemned out of her own mouth. ” so officers must be sent to search her home — he called it ten to one that they would find trinkets such as beads or crucifixes or other trumpery meantime she must be stripped and should the devil ’ s marks be found about her sure enough two bitch ’ s teats hung down between her secrets and the fundament then she must be kept from sleep and meat and watched most constantly old bess confessed at first light on the third day he seized on me to write her testimony on first of may year of our lord sixteen forty-five elizabeth bell confessed she kept familiars including but not restricted to a greyhound called vinegar tom a ferret by the name of littleman a shrew called peck-in-the-crown and also a most verminous mouse called news and having summoned up and suckled them she sent her imps to spread the dropsy and to kill richard tayler ’ s horse and michael edwards ’ s swine and freely she confessed to having met all hugger-mugger with divers adjacent witches in other towns we took their names who caused the justice ’ s son to stray and drown in the sea-marshes god have mercy he took me by the arm we stepped outside the magistrates were due within the hour bell ’ s list of names would carry him through essex to suffolk norfolk kent and bedfordshire — might it please me to accompany him as scribe the wages would be modest but i could expect to witness many true and strange effects he had himself observed a kentish woman who mothered lambs and once contrariwise had seen a goat delivered of a human shape — evil rambled among us england was plagued with satan ’ s emissaries we must pluck them down and let the good news be proclaimed in smoke “ such names ” he said “ no mortal could invent. ” touch a needle watch it scent about quivering after its true north uncertain not to be trusted till it settle — such was i. god knows a man ’ s life has few turning points — say he forsakes his father ’ s dearest hope to answer his vocation or say he marries for love so losing his inheritance do such acts constitute a free election look to yourself how many decisions brought you to this parish minister-to-be fewer than you might care to think we are as we were made but standing there holding the widow ’ s words in my two hands i knew chance had at last combined with choice that evening waiting in the middle wood for alice to appear i turned it over whether to sell with scant words and poor sighs her dearly-bought affections whether to leave her suddenly on what must seem a fool ’ s errand ... there was a stand of laurel we had made our meeting place i had prepared some words that balanced a worldly wish to prove myself against my promise to make alice my wife i sat then stood and paced about then sat once more then lay and studied stalks and blades then thought to pass the time by picking simples for a posy that might sweeten our farewell but bending to my task disturbed a woodlark ’ s nest the buzz and fluster of a woodlark ’ s flight — scissor and stitch at once i followed his swerve north where the woods run out to open fields and the coal path spools down to the harbour — there i lost him where was alice i looked out over meadows yet to be laid up for mowing ponds and cherry orchards hedgerows lined the road i meant to climb next day how paltry my equivocations seemed and how unmanly how unmannerly to stay and parcel out over-subtle reasons such that i could not ask her to allow much less approve ... better to leave at once i met with him at dawn we headed east they say there is a bird the osprey the fish hawk so majestic it can mesmerise its prey subduing it without a touch a fair example of authority but whether as the book says the firmament “ sheweth the handiwork of the creator ” who “ sets a tabernacle for the sun ” which is a “ strong man coming from his chamber friend to the bridegroom ” yes was all one to him not that he had a narrow nature not that he made a painful study of his life but i marvel that his mind could entertain nothing but proven truths that being few huddled together like beasts in a storm yet he was merciful and stood upon these points that we should not accuse another soul nor force confession from the examinate by violence our methods must be nice sometimes to keep them waking was enough — if they would sit or offer to couch down we would desire them to walk about — and the swimming test was only used at such time of the year as when none took a harm by it the man was so averse to witnessing a spectacle of pain that when our work was done he would not suffer us to tarry long or watch the execution how can you call him as is the fashion cruel cruel you say as much the way you shift and smile and study the rugosity of the damson stones you ’ ve ranged about your plate — your very attitude accuses us and still you smile well i shall take your part you think our evidence the product of ill-disposed constitutions silly souls whose fancies working by gross fumes and vapours led them to believe themselves such people as their confessions blazoned them to be as for the discoverer as for me why you judge us busy men as i suppose troublesome fellows out for gain or else frighted by devils of our own design — am i not right ah child had you but seen the welcome and good entertainment we received ranging from town to town without control when his name ran on ahead like hope itself pausing to wait for us at a turn in the road or on a stranger ’ s lips ... to have but heard a crowd of russet-coats imploring us to such alms-deeds such tender ministries ... well unrecorded is not unremembered one night now were my goodwife still alive i would not speak of this and this but one example drawn from many i tell it in confidence that you will keep it close one night i say a girl stole to my room she was she said with child and showing signs her first she said as i could well believe for she was barely more than child herself and having neither mother sister nor any female companion and being much afraid of what her father should he find her changed might do had come to me in brief she was affected by a strange disease and now before i well know what is happening she has untied a ribbon pulled down her blouse and shown herself — her pale skin lapped by candlelight butter-gold flawless except her breasts were dappled here and there with gray-green blemishes — and she “ might these be fairy rings am i bewitched ” i stood aghast like you helpless and mute — she takes my hand — her breath on me her bright eyes on me all this time — and draws me near until as a flower at the end of day closes upon a raindrop my fingers close upon her trembling warmth ... but — one more glass sir one more glass of wine before you go now i insist the parish will be yours tomorrow god and his people will forgive a little cheer ... suppose you sit once more — why yes there if you like where you can see my herb garden ... i planted it the year dear alice passed in summer you will wake and drowse to delicate perfumes ... a glass i say there now let me beg your further judgment i mean john knowles you must have heard the name — he was notorious even in his youth when he was summoned twice before the synod pastor of brandeston that was his title though if he sought to make a fair show in the flesh such is the devil ’ s business an old man certain as i am i but young enough to play the knave with us making us run him back and forth three nights and days together before he would confess to having sunk a sailing vessel out of ipswich ... and yet when it came after much wrestling not to begrudge our toil the fall was swift drag a man from his last-but-one defence — and then stand down have patience he will yield permit his vanity one bauble — he is apt to cast it back at you for pride achieves its final flower in authoring its own defeat i say his was a free confession did it not grieve you to have made fourteen new widows in a quarter-hour i waited his reply no he was joyful to see the power his imps possessed did you not fear the gallows or the stake no for he had a charm to keep him free and do you now repent your wickedness no cruel malice was his chief delight his was the only execution that we witnessed before he was brought out they cut his tongue “ we must have no more juggling from you john ” and stripped him to his shirt they fastened him with shackles and a steel brace to the stake and hung a bag of powder round his neck then officers stacked reed and faggots about his body and set fire on the reed — the wind being high this took no little time — and as i was so jostled in the press i saw no more until a great flame rose the crowd fell silent then that sparkled and deformed the visor of his face — and so at last the powder caught and he gave up the ghost how enviously life clings to its toy and then casts it aside broiled black puffed up knowles suffered great extremity in his death which notwithstanding he had borne with patience — and it seemed the people were impressed by this for as they went their ways some doffed their hats causing my companion to cry out that knowles was scandalous that he had carried himself as though he were the holy sacrament even unto the stake and that they had done right to send the wolf back whence he came and while he spoke i noted his pale brow and the unseasonable bloom upon his cheeks for these were signs he died within the year know this the instrument whereby god called so many to knowledge so many to salvation the man of letters that readily could give in any matter of controversy a godly learned sentence the man of law who persecuted in excess of two hundred and fifty witches — of whom more than half were duly executed — passed peacefully in his bed of a consumption not greatly troubled in his conscience as you may have falsely heard nor was he once suspected and with great zeal he went about his godly work some two years unmolested until the lord in mercy gave him rest i tried to see a life continuing the trade taking our method north through lincolnshire perhaps to scotland where the savages busied themselves designing ever crueller tortures — was this my mission to enlighten them — but no i made for home with tales to tell took up my father ’ s ministry and in time persuaded alice to forgive my leaving her some discoverers seeking to be justified have published tedious apologies but such comes too near tendering a confession our sanction may be found in the book of exodus twenty-two eighteen i have committed and need commit nothing further to record what comes back now most clearly and most often is not the tidy disembellished funeral he wanted neither psalms nor solemn bells no rosemary to ornament his coffin much less my undeniable disappointment at learning that he was — not quite low-born yet something shy of a true gentleman — like me a minister ’ s third son and his mother french she had escaped he said the massacres in paris but walking out together that first morning our work before us when we found the verges lit with new-blown colours — bluebells cornflowers eyebright — like intermeddling voices so i thought each one contending with its neighbour to be heard my companion walked in silence hours would pass before i found the nerve to enquire towards what his silence tended and when at last i did his answer was so short and quick — “ the days to come ” — i did not ask again the sun dazzled my eyes and i allowed myself to fancy we had left the road behind and were ascending into the blue ether england disappearing far below already the syringa was in bloom its scent so concentrated in the dawn — open the window this herb breathe it now the smell is like the sweat of a young girl who runs in a summer meadow is it not

in the temple a pear blackens in a statue 's palm birds steal the grain a man climbs the steps holding his severed hand but no miracle occurs his body refuses to reach out and claim what it lost a woman in a white dress waits to be overshadowed as she plucks her eyelashes—one for the horses one for the rain one for the hair on the back of her lover 's hands she wants her virtue restored to return to a morning when her skin was new and unwounded when her mouth still fit her mother 's breast you came to ask if it 's true if angels weep until their faces become human and if the dead can escape their tombs then— you trap wind as it enters the statue 's mouth and command it to rise walk

memory is flotsam yes just below the surface an eternal city a heap of rubble debris smaller than your fist an animal with- out a leash organized wreck- age ghost net or one hanging silence on the phone— she 's gone my sister said and we wept and wept over my grandmother while my sister sat with her body and me in the static and the rabbi they sent told her to recite psalms as comfort so we listened to each other breathe instead and my sister 's breath was a tunnel a handful of pebbles a knotted chinese jump-rope her breath was the coiled terrycloth turban our grandmother wore when she cooked or walked the shallow end of her condo pool for exercise— our grandmother still somewhere in her white turban sewing cornish game hens together with needle and string or somewhere in her good wig playing poker or somewhere in her easy chair watching cnn while cookies shaped like our initials bake in her oven o memory how much you erased how many holes we punched in your facts since who knows the stories she never told about the camps there are no marked graves just too much food on holidays diabetes my mother 's fear of ships and the motion of some suspension bridges o memory you 've left us trauma below the surface and some above like the fact that i can't shake the december my sister 's red hair caught fire from leaning too close to the menorah's candles our grandmother putting her out with a dish towel with her strong arms
for kellie jones born 16 may 1959 lately i 've become accustomed to the way the ground opens up and envelopes me each time i go out to walk the dog or the broad edged silly music the wind makes when i run for a bus ... things have come to that and now each night i count the stars and each night i get the same number and when they will not come to be counted i count the holes they leave nobody sings anymore and then last night i tiptoed up to my daughter 's room and heard her talking to someone and when i opened the door there was no one there ... only she on her knees peeking into her own clasped hands
who would have imagined that i would have to go a million miles away from the place where i was born to find people who would love me and that i would go that distance and that i would find those people in the dream joanne was showing me how much arm to amputate if your hand gets trapped in the gears of the machine if you acted fast she said you could save everything above the wrist you want to keep a really sharp blade close by she said now i raise that hand to scratch one of those nasty little scabs on the back of my head and we sit outside and watch the sun go down inflamed as an appendicitis over western illinois — which then subsides and cools into a smooth gray sea who knows this might be the last good night of summer my broken nose is forming an idea of what ’ s for supper hard to believe that death is just around the corner what kind of idiot would think he even had a destiny i was on the road for so long by myself i took to reading motel bibles just for company lying on the chintz bedspread before going to sleep still feeling the motion of the car inside my body i thought some wrongness in my self had made me that alone and god said you are worth more to me than one hundred sparrows and when i read that i wept and god said whom have i blessed more than i have blessed you and i looked at the mini bar and the bad abstract hotel art on the wall and the dark tv set watching like a deacon and god said survive and carry my perfume among the perishing

i do n't want to be alive anymore i do n't want to be alive enough to want that one is not meant to turn on one 's creator with ferocity expendable in only one way or is that exactly how one is meant to turn to burn beyond the love that from beyond being has come to us christ 's ever unhearable and thus always too bearable scream in love and dread we learn to listen for beloved dread coming upon us like a whiplash rain we watch through a window in pain we learn pain sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia there gleams a scalpel blade so clean with meaning so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue that drawing it —in season due — across my own throat there comes not blood but an ancient answering starlight once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice with a view of sky-contempted skyscrapers and lake michigan 's immaculate sewage my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels my soul —deadword die to find it for self-pity there must remain a self ah but even shitting one 's self one still finds one 's self hastening to hide it all from the kind ukranian nearly bearded night nurse fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs my diaphanous shoulders the very air eating me like a late leaf that once i would have flourished for a perishable lover or lonelied like some catpiss poignancy into a poem dead brain living will little pills entangling pain with adoration of it morphine machine whose little beep heavenly bell conjures me to the suddenly more tolerable hallways of hell lovely leila so unsurgically curved disclosing as she leans to clean my lines a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace of a glacier the brain the brain the brain flickering electrically in and out in out— not the mind in which i love my wife whose tightwound nightmind conjures christ in diapers for instance filthy infant or later in a mist of adolescent bad weather bored of wood dogdead judea squawk-box god some restless absurdity of earth she says through which the rest of heaven can come once upon a time i walked through the chemical glamour of a night refinery sparking dangerously without and within for beside me under her underclothes undulated an incarnation of creation 's finest failure moonskin to make a young man wince coupled with stifling innocence still we managed and over the wrought-iron railing of the country club to which neither of us could possibly belong in the moonskinned pool that seemed both to embody and imbibe her we improved and later out on a green to be sixteen when the starshower i thought was mine was mining me for sweat muscle memory to make its own death shine unceasingly inside of me even unto hell we excelled can it be that her last name was really key so much life in this poem so much salvageable and saving love but it is i fear i swear i tear open what heart i have left to keep it from being and beating and bearing down upon me • what rest in faith wrested from grief what truce with truth in bowing down not to the ground of being but simply to the ground affliction flickers distant now like a structure on fire love's reprieve moves through me like a breeze but antlike existence crawls all over me lord and i cry out if you call this vise quiet a cry this riot of needs and genes an i feelingly among the bones and nerves of sounds i make my scathing way failingly in church or in the parked car before work i try to pray what might it mean to surrender to the wonder nothing means not to end with a little flourish of earth not to end • love is the living heart of dread love i love you unto the very edge of being dead • something in us suffering touches teaches first to find little coves in our loves blank nothings wherein we are what we always were — blank nothings — but changed or rearranged as atoms in the random kingdom of things hand we say or eye or hair as if to make ourselves — to stake ourselves — truly there knowing now not to move in time we are moved by tiger-striped tails bloodfine fins some natureless cerulean one would say thinking oneself out of nature something in us suffering touches torches so we may saunter seeingly through an altogether other element as once in the shedd aquarium in chicago i floated a moment with my love and the two new lives borne from us who loved best the eensy green almost unfish more like the stars when you close your eyes and whirl open to the whirling grains so freed from things you fall down laughing at the havoc for me for a long time not the minnows mattered but the pattern after miraculous i did n't think to think all those mite-eyes and animate instants answering at once to my need and to nothing as if my very nerves worked in finally a saving sense something in us touches suffering touching us like the constellations of kinetic quiet that bound us beyond us as right to the wall the girls pressed their still-forming faces through which the wild new schools flew almost too green too blue to stand and i held your hand

some lamp sputters its dusty light across some desk some hand shaking works the strained rope twisting and knifing weaving tugging tight a bellowing circle randy travis steamy drawl and hiccup on the staticky am backs the ritual of drooping loop sweat drips an awful hallelujah god glares askance but the artist doesn ’ t waver—wrists click cadence knots become a path to what makes saviors the sagging hoop bemoans a need to squeeze its craving for a breath within the ring

when the townspeople gave the teenaged buddha a glass of wine so delicious he grew to an unthinkable size and froze into a blue statue that shielded the town from a wave that broke upon his back and would have swept away the town if he ’ d not tasted the wine and afterward the people were overjoyed and said they would do good deeds like carpool their children to school more often and plant lettuce everywhere while the buddha melted into water and receded into the calm sane sea
1. the candle will be our medium for dialogue we must always be on speaking terms 2. when you see the candle by the bedside burning it will be my message to you do not touch 3. you will heal through herbs the words i give you to spray unto the solution 4. never dress in black i may mistake you for someone ready to die 5. as much as possible do not speak wickedly or damn anyone 6. as much as

bells snail shells you also know the chant 9. do not be tempted by possessions titles if you have patience i will make possible those you actually will need 10. remember this pact i will give you health long life aiku all this was negotiated just prior to his birth he probably kneeled before the owner of the sky while iku his patron orisha and many egun sat watching with fly whisks in hand and full regalia after all one of their own was about to embark on his journey to the human world the ilé aiyé he probably placed in circular fashion inside a big calabash all his choices probably whispered into the gourd a slow `` ashé tó iba eshu '' we say probably because one thing is for sure el niño does not remember the details in fact no one does except the deities iku no one remembers the details of their creation no one remembers the destiny the mission they chose their personal orisha and most importantly the date of their last breath memory continuity keeping el hilo de la conversación never losing the wavy fragile link that keeps you grounded to yr root the dialogue with spirits that may tap yr left shoulder all that but no one remembers no one remembers ésto si es trágico in order to recall the details of what went on in the other world to map his destiny el niño must be taken for divination and even then one session won ’ t do it the story will get revealed as his life turns each page changes rhythm the oracle is cast several more times so they took el niño to the diviner edikán 's house after pouring libations reciting the necessary ayuba prayers—greeting the creator the ancestors the divination earth wind river ocean jungle crossroad orishas edikán cast the divining chain/ópele used by the babalawo a picture began to emerge he said the orishas egun collectively called ara orun or citizens of the other world have given us certain verses stories to deliver messages regarding the rhythms of our lives he said el niño ’ s patron deity is oshun but he will always have an affinity with ogun obatalá but most prominent is his close relationship with egun that is the ancestors iku ’ s messengers he said it would be through a kinship with egun that he would accomplish his most difficult tasks even the arts of divination he will be a mouthpiece for egun edikán said el niño has a predisposition to a vivid imagination because of this there are will be mysterious phenomena happening to him like visions dreams of secret songs he will not regard them as strange he said el niño should be taught even at an early age the rigors of an herbalist he should be taught at least how to recognize certain trees plants the healing properties of the most commonly used herbs their harvesting times how they mix with what substances all this will eventually lead to an encyclopedic knowledge not only of their healing properties but of their ability to alter the invisible rhythms that underlie most things edikán said there will be certain resguardos that must be prepared so as to begin bridging the gap between orishas iku egun himself even though el niño ’ s inner head/ori inu chose a good destiny in the other world such destiny must be aligned with his physical head/ori in this world it will be orishas egun that will focus his life help him fulfill the destiny he chose in the other world he said beginning with the feet el niño must be securely fastened to the earth so as to not depart too soon for the other world you see there is always the detail of iku being overprotective the relationship is like playing with a leopard—even an affectionate jab with its paw will cause a scar the head will also have to be ritually prepared fed with bits of white fruit among other ingredients thus given a firm root stability— “ para que su cabeza no esté en el aire ” he said we were witness to this event we heard what needed to be done there was actually a time maybe this is still going on when people consulted with the spirit world the other world on such occasions as the third month after birth we collected the ingredients that would shape his destiny began to assemble them much of them were from the river the jungle of course the cemetery we heard what needed to be done ara orun are hip to the images subtle rhythms that stories verses evoke the same images subtle rhythms running through our lives edikán said that barring some details of modernity his life would follow a certain ancient story pertaining to the divination— ofun is like this/ ofun ni jé bé— the page continues to turn.the rhythm the rhythm will come from

in the cold season in a locality accustomed to heat more than to cold to horizontality more than to a mountain a child was born in a cave in order to save the world it blew as only in deserts in winter it blows athwart to him all things seemed enormous his mother ’ s breast the steam out of the ox ’ s nostrils caspar balthazar melchior—the team of magi their presents heaped by the door ajar he was but a dot and a dot was the star keenly without blinking through pallid stray clouds upon the child in the manger from far away— from the depth of the universe from its opposite end—the star was looking into the cave and that was the father ’ s stare december 1987
for v.s when it ’ s christmas we ’ re all of us magi at the grocers ’ all slipping and pushing where a tin of halvah coffee-flavored is the cause of a human assault-wave by a crowd heavy-laden with parcels each one his own king his own camel nylon bags carrier bags paper cones caps and neckties all twisted up sideways reek of vodka and resin and cod orange mandarins cinnamon apples floods of faces no sign of a pathway toward bethlehem shut off by blizzard and the bearers of moderate gifts leap on buses and jam all the doorways disappear into courtyards that gape though they know that there ’ s nothing inside there not a beast not a crib nor yet her round whose head gleams a nimbus of gold emptiness but the mere thought of that brings forth lights as if out of nowhere herod reigns but the stronger he is the more sure the more certain the wonder in the constancy of this relation is the basic mechanics of christmas that ’ s what they celebrate everywhere for its coming push tables together no demand for a star for a while but a sort of good will touched with grace can be seen in all men from afar and the shepherds have kindled their fires snow is falling not smoking but sounding chimney pots on the roof every face like a stain herod drinks every wife hides her child he who comes is a mystery features are not known beforehand men ’ s hearts may not be quick to distinguish the stranger but when drafts through the doorway disperse the thick mist of the hours of darkness and a shape in a shawl stands revealed both a newborn and spirit that ’ s holy in your self you discover you stare skyward and it ’ s right there a star
gray whale now that we are sending you to the end that great god tell him that we who follow you invented forgiveness and forgive nothing i write as though you could understand and i could say it one must always pretend something among the dying when you have left the seas nodding on their stalks empty of you tell him that we were made on another day the bewilderment will diminish like an echo winding along your inner mountains unheard by us and find its way out leaving behind it the future dead and ours when you will not see again the whale calves trying the light consider what you will find in the black garden and its court the sea cows the great auks the gorillas the irreplaceable hosts ranged countless and fore-ordaining as stars our sacrifices join your word to theirs tell him that it is we who are important
to wake to winter in the coming out of the time of year when they release the masterpieces but to be still in the other night some drown in movies some prefer the unfinished ungovernable recital a mystical ecology where one dies in a camp or rolls out with the dice on the sidewalk among boys with cardboard shields and plays dead in white crinoline what if paradise was only lifting the veil to flirt no one perfect but perfection inserts us so pascal thinks a god in his pocket what if paradise meant walking on the ground of our self estrangement and the veil of our gaze an unsteady balm was not what we saw through but were twisting untwisting— do you believe we were never strictly servants
back in those days when he told me about his adventures in sex clubs it was n't the whys and wherefores but technical details like going rafting down the colorado river and when he wrote about a gay male friend whose first sexual experience was with his stepfather the friend told him it was n't weird but the best possible thing that could have happened i saw then that god who i never believed in was dwelling in my heart as a negative that the negative had been developed into a picture of a man who stares up at the sky on a day so clear he sees through the mountain 's shadows to the divinely human-seeming form that climbs it— a neighbor in running shoes and sunglasses jogging up the slope with his dog tongue panting and slavering an acute look of happiness in its eyes that could turn at any moment into exhaustion or pain as in a maze of cubicles called asshole alley little pyramids of canvas called lust of the pharaohs different pricing for what you want depending on the equipment the air thick with a sour acidic head-fogging reek of come and my pal the poet who believed in infernal chemistry in the spirit as a kind of `` spooky action at a distance '' he communed with this god this eternally dying father of all matter who made out of our bodies his own maze of cubicles where he hides himself away—his sanctuary asshole alley where god 's own unholy loves bubble all around him like a cauldron in his ears— and my poet pal heard the bubbling he stirred the pot he showed me the holy city the sexual new jerusalem that came prepared as a bride adorned for her husband —that was how it was in those days back when my friend had n't yet met the coroner who wrote down his cause of death as `` polysubstance abuse '' that brought on his heart attack while fucking and regardless if i believed whenever we were together god shone clearer— those were the days when every morning god woke up in a blur of ecstasy and went to bed every night in divine rage whoever loved him he loved whoever hated him he hated back for who can doubt the vitality of hate or the volatility of love

no not in the flesh — if jesus was ever in ordinary flesh — but in the faces of the christian ladies heads held high chanting their sorrows and joys for all to share he had turned away froggy said from sacred things since he was old enough to pay his way and here he was half-gone on muscatel when he felt the soul soar loose from the wreck of his body all 350 misshapen pounds of it no not in church but on “ the damn crosstown streetcar running late. ” a distant sunday night in the city of dreams froggy on his way to his weekend of the usual low-notes cheap cigars michigan wine and stud poker when jesus “ come a knockin ’ ” at twelfth street the trolley stopped and a dozen ladies mounted each in her best flowered dress each with her worn bible in hand each one blessed and glowing “ changed my life ” froggy says — for maybe the hundredth time — though how is hard to say orphan of destiny descendant of voyagers fur traders whiskey priests run amok in the final wilderness froggy takes his ease on the battered throne of history — a sprung barrel chair — his tiny slippered feet resting on a mismatched ottoman out on the driveway sunday ’ s his day he tells us sleeps late breakfasts on oj and sips of “ morgan davis ” — a consecrated beverage — and delivers his great truths to anyone slow enough or dumb enough to listen
if one saves a butterfly has one saved the world rabbi says if one saves one butterfly even with long wings one butterfly that has fallen into water it may be said “ he has saved the whole world. ” if one saves a motley moth is it the same rabbi it is valid if one saves a dirty monkey from a flame for example it is as the saying is he or she has saved the whole world it is valid for all creatures and not more so for the creatures who know how to recite the blessings it is always valid even on the sabbath it is said the creatures of the sky are owned by no one like the land if one saves the book from being destroyed is it also saving a world rabbi god forbid yes saving the book from the fire saving the book or books from the fire is known to be comparable he who saves a book and he who writes a holy book it should be said they have saved the whole world like a book if one saves a rose one rose from the garden of your dead teacher is it still appropriate to think she has saved the world the rabbi was silent and seemed troubled he replied if the house of the great teacher is in ruins and the garden is a scandal and one saves one rose from his garden it is said even of one rose it is like saving the world it is also said the rose will grow as large as the world
this is the month and this the happy morn wherein the son of heav'n 's eternal king of wedded maid and virgin mother born our great redemption from above did bring for so the holy sages once did sing that he our deadly forfeit should release and with his father work us a perpetual peace that glorious form that light unsufferable and that far-beaming blaze of majesty wherewith he wont at heav'n 's high council-table to sit the midst of trinal unity he laid aside and here with us to be forsook the courts of everlasting day and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay say heav'nly muse shall not thy sacred vein afford a present to the infant god hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain to welcome him to this his new abode now while the heav'n by the sun 's team untrod hath took no print of the approaching light and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright see how from far upon the eastern road the star-led wizards haste with odours sweet o run prevent them with thy humble ode and lay it lowly at his blessed feet have thou the honour first thy lord to greet and join thy voice unto the angel quire from out his secret altar touch 'd with hallow 'd fire it was the winter wild while the heav'n-born child all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies nature in awe to him had doff 'd her gaudy trim with her great master so to sympathize it was no season then for her to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour only with speeches fair she woos the gentle air to hide her guilty front with innocent snow and on her naked shame pollute with sinful blame the saintly veil of maiden white to throw confounded that her maker 's eyes should look so near upon her foul deformities but he her fears to cease sent down the meek-ey 'd peace she crown 'd with olive green came softly sliding down through the turning sphere his ready harbinger with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing and waving wide her myrtle wand she strikes a universal peace through sea and land no war or battle 's sound was heard the world around the idle spear and shield were high uphung the hooked chariot stood unstain 'd with hostile blood the trumpet spake not to the armed throng and kings sate still with awful eye as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by but peaceful was the night wherein the prince of light his reign of peace upon the earth began the winds with wonder whist smoothly the waters kist whispering new joys to the mild ocean who now hath quite forgot to rave while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave the stars with deep amaze stand fix 'd in steadfast gaze bending one way their precious influence and will not take their flight for all the morning light or lucifer that often warn 'd them thence but in their glimmering orbs did glow until their lord himself bespake and bid them go and though the shady gloom had given day her room the sun himself withheld his wonted speed and hid his head for shame as his inferior flame the new-enlighten 'd world no more should need he saw a greater sun appear than his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear the shepherds on the lawn or ere the point of dawn sate simply chatting in a rustic row full little thought they than that the mighty pan was kindly come to live with them below perhaps their loves or else their sheep was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep when such music sweet their hearts and ears did greet as never was by mortal finger strook divinely warbled voice answering the stringed noise as all their souls in blissful rapture took the air such pleasure loth to lose with thousand echoes still prolongs each heav'nly close nature that heard such sound beneath the hollow round of cynthia 's seat the airy region thrilling now was almost won to think her part was done and that her reign had here its last fulfilling she knew such harmony alone could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union at last surrounds their sight a globe of circular light that with long beams the shame-fac 'd night array 'd the helmed cherubim and sworded seraphim are seen in glittering ranks with wings display 'd harping in loud and solemn quire with unexpressive notes to heav'n 's new-born heir such music as 't is said before was never made but when of old the sons of morning sung while the creator great his constellations set and the well-balanc 'd world on hinges hung and cast the dark foundations deep and bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep ring out ye crystal spheres once bless our human ears if ye have power to touch our senses so and let your silver chime move in melodious time and let the bass of heav'n 's deep organ blow and with your ninefold harmony make up full consort to th'angelic symphony for if such holy song enwrap our fancy long time will run back and fetch the age of gold and speckl 'd vanity will sicken soon and die and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould and hell itself will pass away and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day yea truth and justice then will down return to men orb 'd in a rainbow and like glories wearing mercy will sit between thron 'd in celestial sheen with radiant feet the tissu 'd clouds down steering and heav'n as at some festival will open wide the gates of her high palace hall but wisest fate says no this must not yet be so the babe lies yet in smiling infancy that on the bitter cross must redeem our loss so both himself and us to glorify yet first to those ychain 'd in sleep the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep with such a horrid clang as on mount sinai rang while the red fire and smould'ring clouds outbrake the aged earth aghast with terror of that blast shall from the surface to the centre shake when at the world 's last session the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne and then at last our bliss full and perfect is but now begins for from this happy day th'old dragon under ground in straiter limits bound not half so far casts his usurped sway and wrath to see his kingdom fail swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail the oracles are dumb no voice or hideous hum runs through the arched roof in words deceiving apollo from his shrine can no more divine with hollow shriek the steep of delphos leaving no nightly trance or breathed spell inspires the pale-ey 'd priest from the prophetic cell the lonely mountains o'er and the resounding shore a voice of weeping heard and loud lament from haunted spring and dale edg 'd with poplar pale the parting genius is with sighing sent with flow'r-inwoven tresses torn the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn in consecrated earth and on the holy hearth the lars and lemures moan with midnight plaint in urns and altars round a drear and dying sound affrights the flamens at their service quaint and the chill marble seems to sweat while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat peor and ba a lim forsake their temples dim with that twice-batter 'd god of palestine and mooned ashtaroth heav'n 's queen and mother both now sits not girt with tapers holy shine the libyc hammon shrinks his horn in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thammuz mourn and sullen moloch fled hath left in shadows dread his burning idol all of blackest hue in vain with cymbals ring they call the grisly king in dismal dance about the furnace blue the brutish gods of nile as fast isis and orus and the dog anubis haste nor is osiris seen in memphian grove or green trampling the unshower 'd grass with lowings loud nor can he be at rest within his sacred chest naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud in vain with timbrel 'd anthems dark the sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp 'd ark he feels from juda 's land the dreaded infant 's hand the rays of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn nor all the gods beside longer dare abide not typhon huge ending in snaky twine our babe to show his godhead true can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew so when the sun in bed curtain 'd with cloudy red pillows his chin upon an orient wave the flocking shadows pale troop to th'infernal jail each fetter 'd ghost slips to his several grave and the yellow-skirted fays fly after the night-steeds leaving their moon-lov 'd maze but see the virgin blest hath laid her babe to rest time is our tedious song should here have ending heav'n 's youngest-teemed star hath fix 'd her polish 'd car her sleeping lord with handmaid lamp attending and all about the courtly stable bright-harness 'd angels sit in order serviceable
strapped to the bed of circumcision lies my son this mutilation ties you to the fathers they will never let you forget or your flesh be enfranchised ever though you pray all your life long they set you early on the rack infect you with a fever of remembering in the marriage bed when you are naked there the sign is red there is neither meeting nor mating but the past cries that you 've been waited for and wed already— i will not bless this mark upon your body for you the hurricane is rising fast i feel the horns of moses in my head and law wrenched again from the dead hand of deity and i descend out of the blast to you mad with loneliness upon this bed but i reserve also the rage that broke the law upon you like a rain of stone that other time i saw you so could yearn the law is broken baby i will not ascend again
getting the child to bed is awful work committing that rage to sleep that will not sleep the lie rots in my throat saying “ o.k there is balm in gilead go to bed honey of generation has betrayed us both. ” and truly it is no wild surmise of darkness nor pisgah purview of canaan drowned in blood but only my child saying its say in bed if madness ever covers me the caul contract that now but loosely insinuates a shroud i shall go howling into the conscious grave god keep children from the power of the dog follow that note into the uttering horn awake in the womb from which i was born
back before color threaded the world when everything was in black-and-white i was the only pagan at school hiding my breath with its curry and accent mouthing words to prayers i didn't understand i wondered why there were always holy men but so few holy women i wanted to be enchanted to steal the baby jesus from the christmas play and keep him hidden in my closet pull him out when i needed to be saved i wanted to be the blue madonna holding all the pieces of her son together half a world away girls my age came as close to god as anyone could be they were already throwing their bodies over their husband 's funeral pyres flung out like blankets over the flames chanting ram ram like a nursery rhyme my mother told me it was a holy mantra the more i said it the holier i would be but i never really knew how or why just that it was supposed to happen once i tried saying it as many times as i could in fifty seconds but nothing no miracle no halo of thorns around my head and all i could think about were those girls widows at fifteen what did burning flowers smell like something terrible something holy
1. two gods the one in the closet and the one from school days and both are not mine i opened the door on god at dusk and closed him the rest of the day he perched on the ledge above my father 's shirts and wool suits a mandir in every hindu house ours smelling of starch surrounded by ties and old suitcases i was the ghost at school sat on the pew and watched as other girls held god under their tongues my lips remember the prayer my parents taught me those evenings with their bedroom closet open—ganesh carved in metal krishna blue in a frame i do n't remember the translation never sure i really knew it i got mixed up sometimes said a section of the `` our father '' in the middle of the arti ending in amen when i meant krishna krishna not sure when to kneel and when to touch someone 's feet with my hands 2. my name means it all—holiness god evenings praying to a closet my mother says before i was born i was an ache in the back of her throat wind rushing past her ear that my father prayed every evening closet door open for a daughter and so i am evening prayer sunset and mantra at school i longed for a name that was smooth on the backs of my teeth no trick getting it out easy on the mouth a lisa or a julie—brown hair and freckles not skin the color of settling dusk a name you could press your lips to press lips against american names of backyard swings meat loaf in the oven not of one-room apartments overlooking parking lots the smell of curry in a pot food that lined the hallways with its memory for days i watched the hair on my legs grow dark and hated it i longed to disappear to turn the red that sheened on the other girls in school rejecting the sun burning with spite in the mirror i called myself another practicing— the names the prayers fitting words into my mouth as if they belonged ram ram and alleluia bhagvan god the father thy will be done om shanti shanti shanti
this is what i see a grain of wheat in the hand of a small boy barefoot on the unnamed roads sleeping in the dream another is having an oud a violin a guitar a mirror of dew a man about to undress a woman staring a traveler returning everywhere and forgetfulness stealing from itself maktoub the moor says we hold clouds in our mouth and imagine god in our breath
traffic was heavy coming off the bridge and i took the road to the right the wrong one and got stuck in the car for hours most nights i rushed out into the evening without paying attention to the trees whose names i did n't know or the birds which flew heedlessly on i could n't relinquish my desires or accept them and so i strolled along like a tiger that wanted to spring but was still afraid of the wildness within the iron bars seemed invisible to others but i carried a cage around inside me i cared too much what other people thought and made remarks i should n't have made i was silent when i should have spoken forgive me philosophers i read the stoics but never understood them i felt that i was living the wrong life spiritually speaking while halfway around the world thousands of people were being slaughtered some of them by my countrymen so i walked on—distracted lost in thought— and forgot to attend to those who suffered far away nearby forgive me faith for never having any i did not believe in god who eluded me
basho said to refuse a prayer until its warmth hunches inside like a bird in its hutch first the fledgling is born then the worm then they meet somewhere in the grass i choose my paper for its cereal color fuss over shaving a pencil the prayer means to cleanse both triumph and lust o derivative sunlight reaping the trees this whole morning cries through a single reed pencil razor blade spit—i 'll try not to hurry
my objectives this morning were vague as always i 'd hike these hills— a way to keep going against the odds age deals a way to keep body and soul together and not so much thinking as letting things steal into mind— but i started counting from the very first step i took i wore rank old boots ill-laced and patchwork pants around my neck hung the frayed lanyard of a whistle i use to summon our trio of dogs who capered and yelped their pleasure at one of our walks and more miraculous still at having me for a master it 's true in a sense that i always count as i wander though it 's usually the beats of a tune thelonious 's `` blue monk '' a favorite that mark my time these counts felt odder better we scattered a brood of grouse at step 91. the deerflies strafed us at 500 a late trillium glowed by a ledge like a lotus right along the rain kept pounding i was mindful of all these things but i never stopped counting life was good and more it was worthy of better response at 1000 i thought enough—and counted on nothing was coming to mind nothing is coming again from my hike half the day ago with three dogs through rain but a mystic sense of well-being in quietly chanted numbers whatever this trance i treasured it as a wonder not to be wrenched into meaning as in every second counts as in you should count your blessings though of those there seems no doubt
for niyi osundare something in altitude kindles power-thirst mere horse-height suffices the emir bestowing from rich folds of prodigious turban upon crawling peasants in the dust rare imperceptible nods enwrapped in princely boredom i too have known a parching of that primordial palate a quickening to manifest life of a long recessive appetite though strapped and manacled that day i commanded from the pinnacle of a three-tiered world a bridge befitting the proud deranged deity i had become a magic rug of rushing clouds billowed and rubbed its white softness like practiced houri fingers on my sole and through filters of its gauzy fabric revealed wonders of a metropolis magic-struck to fairyland proportions by different adjustments of vision i caused the clouds to float over a stilled landscape over towers and masts and smoke-plumed chimneys or turned the very earth unleashed from itself a roaming fugitive beneath a constant sky then came a sudden brightness over the world a rare winter ’ s smile it was and printed on my cloud carpet a black cross set in an orb of rainbows to which splendid nativity came–who else would come but gray unsporting reason faithless pedant offering a bald refractory annunciation but oh what beauty what speed a chariot of night in panic flight from our royal proclamation of the rites of day and riding out our procession of fantasy we slaked an ancient vestigial greed shriveled by ages of dormancy till the eyes exhausted by glorious pageantries returned to rest on that puny legend of the life jacket stowed away of all places under my seat now i think i know why gods are so partial to heights—to mountain tops and spires to proud iroko trees and thorn-guarded holy bombax why petty household divinities will sooner perch on a rude board strung precariously from brittle rafters of a thatched roof than sit squarely on safe earth
hurrah to them who do nothing see nothing feel nothing whose hearts are fitted with prudence like a diaphragm across womb ’ s beckoning doorway to bar the scandal of seminal rage i ’ m told the owl too wears wisdom in a ring of defense round each vulnerable eye securing it fast against the darts of sight long ago in the middle east pontius pilate openly washed involvement off his white hands and became famous of all the roman officials before him and after who else is talked about every sunday in the apostles ’ creed and talking of apostles that other fellow judas wasn ’ t such a fool either though much maligned by succeeding generations the fact remains he alone in that motley crowd had sense enough to tell a doomed movement when he saw one and get out quick a nice little packet bulging his coat pocket into the bargain—sensible fellow september 1970
the bear was born thrown from its side by killer-of-enemies its rage scratched open several rivers and the gulf of mexico an aspect so to speke made fulsomely as it were one whos habitat full somely made reaches all its leaves and feathers to the smoky air a tanager on an elm in oahu really reminded of the grand canyon by the souvenir mug of the muleskinner the horse the name angel
to be a bride of my own lamentation i wear a dress not of time ’ s poisoned quills but feathers of discontent — kingfishers ghosting in cornstalks my field of frozen flutes the edge of descent digression ’ s highway brings a particulate ash to my mouth starry metals of the meadow ’ s cold snap ravens in the sycamore scorched to black i follow their echo ’ s loop and chase i master the map of never raft its fragments mouth the brightness of human ’ s leftover snow details of fever-clouds where the convent dissolves in violence i wear the canyon like a blank eye lay before the never-returning light my silhouette fossil of the drowned town ’ s scroll • here where your ghost is always departing the ebb and flow of terrestrial tides i follow your echo ’ s loop and chase vortex streets of a cylindrical sound infinite in its arrangements of light the evening veil a partial reveal — how i appear to myself looking past this fact of being underway each day i stow my earthen materials in preparation for the never-end in the snapshot of my dead friend hanging in the room where loved ones refuse return a gradual reduction of color running out of time neck-deep in water we knew no one was coming to help us in the same way one denies language to come from a picture i imagine love a revelation not of mind — the blue gauze of planetary motion — a tone-on-tone painting of a body floating on the sea ’ s shifting horizons it is a question of legibility when i became tired of depicting poetry i became aware of another kind of plane the kind good for dwellings and their narrative escape here children sit up all night by the flames — the orphan boy from blood-stained pottery who singed his head and burned out both his eyes that was your life a prefix for fire spider will weave a ladder to your heart it is said even though you are sleeping intoxicated by abandonment a bitter wind reminiscent of a wave • in the last days of my marriage to god i wandered his spiraled library to read in the dark blank imprints of trees relentless navigation through the stacks of shell-tempered mortuary offerings sandstone saws recovered from the caves i lingered on the stairs of the convent to write these things to recollect myself around midnight the mountains returned the clouds dispersed into semicolons and i with them into a new language its boat temporary invisible i knew i would be traveling like this for centuries this was my first attempt at vanishing i would return before anyone noticed poems to be found in the forest not the mind there ’ s a canyon between this version of me and the shadow in the corner that is mine i wear this canyon like a blank eye
evening the nervous suburbs levitate height does us no harm now we are high above the mineral pools above the flash hotel whose only use is treachery someone knocks on a door and you crouch behind the bed down in the bar the small girls toast their parents the brother breaks a large bone for its marrow i ’ m thinking of a challenge for us all the star in the sky has traveled all the way from home now follow that
dear aleph like ovid i ’ ll have no last words this is what it means to die among barbarians bar bar bar was how the greeks heard our speech — sheep beasts — and so we became barbarians we make them reveal the brutes they are aleph by the things we make them name david they tell me is the one one should aspire to but ever since i first heard them say philistine i ’ ve known i am goliath if i am anything
the snow voids the distance of the road and the first breath comes from the early morning ghosts the sparrows with their hard eyes glisten in the difficult light they preen their feathers and chirp it ’ s as though they were one voice talking to god mornings are a sustained hymn without the precision of faith you ’ ve turned the bag filled with molding bread inside out and watch the old crusts fall to the ice what ’ s left but to watch the daylight halved by the glistening ground what ’ s left but an empty bag and the dust of bread ravaged by songsters there are ruins we witness within the moment of the world ’ s first awakening and the birds love you within that moment they want to eat the air and the stars they ’ ve hungered for little razors little urgent bells the birds steal from each other ’ s mouths which makes you hurt don ’ t ask for more bread the world is in haste to waken don ’ t ask for a name you can surrender for there are more ghosts to placate don ’ t hurt for the sparrows for they love you like a road
they think she lives alone on the edge of town in a two-room house where she moved when her husband died at thirty-five of a gunshot wound in the bed of another woman the curandera and house have aged together to the rhythm of the desert she wakes early lights candles before her sacred statues brews tea of yerbabuena she moves down her porch steps rubs cool morning sand into her hands into her arms like a large black bird she feeds on the desert gathering herbs for her basket her days are slow days of grinding dried snake into powder of crushing wild bees to mix with white wine and the townspeople come hoping to be touched by her ointments her hands her prayers her eyes she listens to their stories and she listens to the desert always to the desert by sunset she is tired the wind strokes the strands of long gray hair the smell of drying plants drifts into her blood the sun seeps into her bones she dozes on her back porch rocking rocking
never let my hands be to any one an occasion to temptation — isabel de flores she was the joke of the angels—a girl crazy enough for god that she despised her own beauty who grew bitter herbs to mix with her food who pinned a garland of roses to her forehead and who in a fury of desire concocted a potion of indian pepper and bark and rubbed it on her face neck and breasts disfiguring herself then locked away in a dark cell where no reflection was possible she begged for death to join her with her master whom she called divine bridegroom thorn in my heart eternal spouse she would see his vague outline feel his cool touch on her fevered brow but as relief came her vision would begin to fade and once again she would dip the iron bar into the coals and pass it gently like a magician ’ s wand over her skin— to feel the passion that flames for a moment in all dying things
when you put on the mask the thunder starts through the nostril ’ s orange you can smell the far hope of rain up in the nilgiris glisten of eucalyptus drip of pine spiders tumbling from their silver webs the mask is raw and red as bark against your facebones you finger the stripes ridged like weals out of your childhood a wind is rising in the north a scarlet light like a fire in the sky when you look through the eyeholes it is like falling night gauzes you in black you are blind as in the beginning of the world sniff seek the moon after a while you will know that creased musky smell is rising from your skin once you locate the ears the drums begin your fur stiffens a roar from the distant left like monsoon water you swivel your sightless head under your sheathed paw the ground shifts wet what is that small wild sound sheltering in your skull against the circle that always closes in just before dawn note the poem refers to a ritual performed by some rajasthani hill tribes to ensure rain and a good harvest
they are thin and rarely marry living out their long lives in spacious rooms french doors giving view to formal gardens where aromatic flowers grow in profusion they play their pianos in the late afternoon tilting their heads at a gracious angle as if listening to notes pitched above the human range age makes them translucent each palpitation of their hearts visible at temple or neck when they die it ’ s in their sleep their spirits shaking gently loose from a hostess too well bred to protest
i. the nest was at rest for a time not being made before the eggs were laid it softened the robin sleeping inside the house the sound of laundry in the dryer the sound of a zipper tumbling inside the apparatus and shirts with buttons as well as napkins and a tablecloth printed with blueberries and stalks of lily of the valley oval for the table with claw legs and extra leaves for guests ii in one account the angels come their hands emerging from their wings like sentences staying as long as it takes for the windows to go from indigo to black as long as it takes for a breath to land in the base of the belly in the cavity wisdom tells us wisdom comes from or first dwells in before it navigates the narrows of the throat becomes mantra becomes guttural becomes spit to aspirate the language the mouth makes the native obligation of this account to its subject is care the form of music the wind chime makes registers the commitment of a furious system filled with conviction to the continued transformation of what is do not ask what has been lost ask what changed an instrument of will the guitar echoes this a chord more reminder than absolute the hand arouses but does not create the scale in this way what rests gets taken up iii in another the mind makes a decision to end its disorder the mind wants first to end the face the subject has had enough one too many figures walking through the orchard the call and response of conversation become an imposition on some other world unbroken by the idea of separate bodies an idea one has never been convinced of and so now it is a relief to believe what one has suspected that separation a trick of perspective though such a revelation does not undo the fatigue of existing in the continuing illusions of others and yet the obligation to be kind to show interest in strangers when they visit with flowers to family whose hands are empty and to doctors not to mention the pain iv in the last account the explosions are too small to be seen and oxygen takes both thirst and hunger away as it ceases to find a home in the lungs and the patient having ceased to feel ceases to breathe as the heart shuts down before the brain and shuts the dreaming down the settling on a nest of images not feeling any form of distress the pathways to distress are blocked but the senses doubled the ears know the house more than they ever did whose clothes occupy the dryer which voice accompanies water v. angels be patient with this subject i know what she would say to you if she could speak if she could see you just inside the window whose top right pane frames what we call a family when the almost mother bird finishes what she is thinking about barely but still hidden from sight if you stopped to look at the nest you would see a sleep so purposeful the ladder of adoration would reverse and you would stay on earth
in life you had a temper your sarcasm was a whetted knife sometimes you shuddered with fear but you made yourself act no matter how few stood with you open the door for eliyahu that he may come in now you return to us in rough times out of smoke and dust that swirls blinding us you come in vision you come in lightning on blackness open the door for eliyahu that he may come in in every generation you return speaking what few want to hear words that burn us that cut us loose so we rise and go again over the sharp rocks upward open the door for eliyahu that he may come in you come as a wild man as a homeless sidewalk orator you come as a woman taking the bima you come in prayer and song you come in a fierce rant open the door for eliyahu that she may come in prophecy is not a gift but sometimes a curse jonah refusing it is dangerous to be right to be righteous to stand against the wall of might open the door for eliyahu that he may come in there are moments for each of us when you summon when you call the whirlwind when you shake us like a rattle then we too must become you and rise open the door for eliyahu that we may come in
i like rosh hashonah late when the leaves are half burnt umber and scarlet when sunset marks the horizon with slow fire and the black silhouettes of migrating birds perch on the wires davening i like rosh hashonah late when all living are counting their days toward death or sleep or the putting by of what will sustain them— when the cold whose tendrils translucent as a jellyfish and with a hidden sting just brush our faces at twilight the threat of frost a premonition a warning a whisper whose words we can not yet decipher but will i repent better in the waning season when the blood runs swiftly and all creatures look keenly about them for quickening danger then i study the rockface of my life its granite pitted and pocked and pickaxed eroded discolored by sun and wind and rain— my rock emerging from the veil of greenery to be mapped to be examined to be judged
the courage to let go of the door the handle the courage to shed the familiar walls whose very stains and leaks are comfortable as the little moles of the upper arm stains that recall a feast a child ’ s naughtiness a loud blattering storm that slapped the roof hard pouring through the courage to abandon the graves dug into the hill the small bones of children and the brittle bones of the old whose marrow hunger had stolen the courage to desert the tree planted and only begun to bear the riverside where promises were shaped the street where their empty pots were broken the courage to leave the place whose language you learned as early as your own whose customs however dan- gerous or demeaning bind you like a halter you have learned to pull inside to move your load the land fertile with the blood spilled on it the roads mapped and annotated for survival the courage to walk out of the pain that is known into the pain that can not be imagined mapless walking into the wilderness going barefoot with a canteen into the desert stuffed in the stinking hold of a rotting ship sailing off the map into dragons ’ mouths cathay india siberia goldeneh medina2 leaving bodies by the way like abandoned treasure so they walked out of egypt.3 so they bribed their way out of russia under loads of straw so they steamed out of the bloody smoking charnelhouse of europe on overloaded freighters forbidden all ports— out of pain into death or freedom or a different painful dignity into squalor and politics we jews are all born of wanderers with shoes under our pillows and a memory of blood that is ours raining down we honor only those jews who changed tonight those who chose the desert over bondage who walked into the strange and became strangers and gave birth to children who could look down on them standing on their shoulders for having been slaves we honor those who let go of every- thing but freedom who ran who revolted who fought who became other by saving themselves a popular preacher or an angel who conveys in mysterious ways teachings only to scholars worthy ofl such communications hebrew 2. golden land yiddish 3. a reference to the biblical exodus out of egypt
the hinge of the year the great gates opening and then slowly slowly closing on us i always imagine those gates hanging over the ocean fiery over the stone grey waters of evening we cast what we must change about ourselves onto the waters flowing to the sea the sins errors bad habits whatever you call them dissolve when i was little i cried out i i i i want i want older i feel less important a worker bee in the hive of history miles of hard labor to make my sweetness the gates are closing the light is failing i kneel before what i love imploring that it may live so much breaks wears down fails in us we must forgive our broken promises— their sharp shards in our hands
a row of tall skinny candles burns quickly into the night air the shames raised over the rest for its hard work darkness rushes in after the sun sinks like a bright plug pulled our eyes drown in night thick as ink pudding when even the moon starves to a sliver of quicksilver the little candles poke holes in the blackness a time to eat fat and oil a time to gamble for pennies and gambol *shames the middle candle that lights the others every night
the songs we join in are beeswax candles burning with no smoke a clean fire licking at the evening our voices small flames quivering the songs string us like beads on the hour the ritual is its own melody that leads us where we have gone before and hope to go again the comfort of year after year order we must touch each base of the haggadah as we pass blessing handwashing dipping this and that voices half harmonize on the brukhahs dear faces like a multitude of moons hang over the table and the truest brief blessing affection and peace that we make

the holy ghost was browsing in his or her library one day in the future unaccountably bored oddly querulous vaguely wanting something that would be quietly unfamiliar `` it does n't have to be great '' said the holy ghost with the faintest note of exasperation in his or her voice `` just so long as it has its own special character '' gliding along the billion shelves incredibly graceful despite his or her mood then the deft and lovely hand of the holy ghost lit on a slim volume of poetry— it was your book it was your book the first poem caused the holy ghost to frown ah but not with disdain rather with curiosity the second poem brought a brightening of divine eyes and the page was turned as if by a pensive breeze maybe it happened after your death but so what it happened `` i 'm taking this back to my perfect desk '' said the hg `` this is really something ''

i encountered a scaffold outside the holy trinity church in vladimir russia at first i didn ’ t notice her slumped against the side of the church — she was pretty small for a scaffold pretty un- assuming her safety mesh was torn in places and sun-bleached all over and threatened to dislodge due to a forceful wind that was typical of the season she was shaking she was fundamentally insecure she told me that good foundations are essential and that the men who had put her together hadn ’ t taken advantage of the right opportunities now each day someone came by called her “ unsafe ” and also “ a liability ” then left failing to initiate the dismantling process that yes would have been painful and slow but kinder international visitors to the church blamed her for the mess of tools and rags on the grounds and for the fact that they could no longer see the church ’ s celebrated mural depicting saint artemy of verkola unusually pious highly venerated child saint killed by lightning his dead body radiated light never showed signs of decay and was in fact said to have effected multiple miracles of healing i said comforting things to the scaffold but she only seemed to lean more heavily against the side of the church we are rarely independent structures she said before she dropped a bolt pin which released a long section of tube which released another bolt pin which released several wooden boards that scraped another tube and made an unbearable sound

i the story of him who knew the most of all men know who made the journey heartbroken reconciled who knew the way things were before the flood the secret things the mystery who went to the end of the earth and over who returned and wrote the story on a tablet of stone he built uruk he built the keeping place of anu and ishtar the outer wall shines in the sun like brightest copper the inner wall is beyond the imagining of kings study the brickwork study the fortification climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace study how it is made from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields the ponds and orchards this is uruk the city of gilgamesh the wild ox son of lugalbanda son of the lady wildcow ninsun gilgamesh the vanguard and the rear guard of the army shadow of darkness over the enemy field the web the flood that rises to wash away the walls of alien cities gilgamesh the strongest one of all the perfect the terror it is he who opened passes through the mountains and he who dug deep wells on the mountainsides who measured the world and sought out utnapishtim beyond the world it is he who restored the shrines two-thirds a god one-third a man the king go to the temple of anu and ishtar open the copper chest with the iron locks the tablet of lapis lazuli tells the story ii there was no withstanding the aura or power of the wild ox gilgamesh neither the father 's son nor the wife of the noble neither the mother 's daughter nor the warrior 's bride was safe the old men said '' is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people '' the gods of heaven listened to their complaint `` aruru is the maker of this king neither the father 's son nor the wife of the noble is safe in uruk neither the mother 's daughter nor the warrior 's bride is safe the old men say 'is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people there is no withstanding the desire of the wild ox `` they called the goddess aruru saying to her '' you made this man now create another create his double and let the two contend let stormy heart contend with stormy heart that peace may come to uruk once again '' aruru listened and heard and then created out of earth clay and divine spittle the double the stormy-hearted other enkidu the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands powerful as ninurta the god of war the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles visits the watering places with the creatures whose hearts delight as his delights in water iii one day a hunter came to a watering place and saw enkidu he stood expressionless astonished then with his silent dogs he went home to his father 's house fear in his belly his face was as one estranged from what he knows he opened his mouth and said to his father `` father i saw a hairy-bodied man today at the watering place powerful as ninurta the god of war he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles he visits the watering places with the beasts he has unset my traps and filled my hunting pits the creatures of the grasslands get away free the wild man sets them free because of him i am no longer a hunter '' his father said `` go to uruk and there present yourself to gilgamesh the king who is the strongest of all the perfect the terror the wise shepherd protector of the people tell him about the power of the wild man ask him to send a harlot back with you a temple prostitute to conquer him with her greater power when he visits the watering place let her show him her breasts her beauty for his wonder he will lie with her in pleasure and then the creatures the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' so the hunter went to gilgamesh in uruk and told him about the power of the wild man and how he had unset the traps and filled the pits so that the creatures got away free the lord of uruk said to the hunter then '' when you return a temple prostitute will go with you and with her beauty conquer the wild man he will lie with her and then the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' iv the harlot and the hunter traveled together taking three days back to the watering place for three more days they waited and finally enkidu came with the creatures that love the water the gazelles and the others so as to drink their fill the temple prostitute looked at him enkidu the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle `` that is enkidu shamhat show him your breasts show him your beauty spread out your cloak on the ground lie down on it the wild man will look at you show him your body the hairy-bodied man will come to you and lie down on you and then show him the things a woman knows how to do the gazelles and with them all the other creatures will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' and so the harlot shamhat showed him her breasts showed him her body the hairy-bodied man came over to her and lay down on her and then she showed him the things a woman knows how to do for seven days enkidu in his wonder lay with her in pleasure and then at last went to seek out the company of the creatures whose hearts delight in feeding upon the grasslands and visiting the watering places and ranging the hills but seeing him they fled the creatures were gone and everything was changed his body that loved to range the hills was now unable to follow but in the mind of the wild man there was beginning a new understanding bewildered he turned and sought out the company of the temple prostitute he sat down beside her and looked into her face and listened to her '' enkidu now you are beautiful as a god why do you seek the company of beasts come with me to the city to uruk to the temple of anu and the goddess ishtar gilgamesh is the ruler the strongest of all the terror the aura and power of his desire can be withstood by no one '' then enkidu whose heart was beginning to know about itself and longed for a companion cried aloud '' take me to uruk the city of gilgamesh whose aura and power can not be withstood i will cry out in uruk challenging him 'it is i enkidu the strength of the wild man born in the wilderness can not be withstood `` the temple prostitute replied `` come then to uruk where the processions are and music and let us go together through the dancing to the palace hall where gilgamesh presides the favorite of the gods the beautiful strongest of all the terror the most desired look at his radiant face the favorite of shamash and enlil ea and anu while you were grazing beastlike with gazelles before your mind had any understanding his mind a gift to the gifted of the gods had a dream of you before you knew of him in the early morning gilgamesh arose and told his mother his dream 'i had a dream a star fell from the heavens a meteorite and lay on the empty plain outside uruk the men and women came and wondered at it i strove with it to lift it but could not i was drawn to it as if it was a woman all-knowing rimat-ninsun spoke to him the lord of uruk gilgamesh his mother all-knowing rimat-ninsun spoke and said '' the star that fell from the heavens the meteorite that lay on the empty plain outside uruk the star you could not lift when you strove with it the star you were drawn to as if drawn to a woman is the strong companion powerful as a star the meteorite of the heavens a gift of the gods that you were drawn to it as if drawn to a woman means that this companion will not forsake you he will protect and guard you with his life this is the fortunate meaning of your dream then gilgamesh the lord of uruk said 'may the dream as you interpret come to pass `` the temple prostitute thus told the tale
i gilgamesh spoke and said to the old man then '' when i looked at you i thought that you were not a man one made like me i had resolved to challenge you as one might challenge a demon a stranger-adversary but now i see that you are utnapishtim made like me a man the one i sought the one from whom i might find out how death can be avoided tell me then father how it came about that you were admitted to the company of gods who granted you eternal life '' the father utnapishtim spoke and said '' i will tell gilgamesh the king the story a secret of the gods i will disclose there was an ancient city shuruppak— you know of it—most fortunate of cities god-favored on the banks of the euphrates the gods in heaven decided in their council to bring the flood down on the fortunate city they sat in secret council together deciding anu was there the councilor enlil ninurta of the silence and there also was the god ennugi monitor of canals and there was ea cleverest of the gods the voice of ea telling me the secret came whispering through the reed walls of my house 'you reed house walls listen and hear me whisper listen and be attentive to what i tell you utnapishtim son of ubartutu abandon your house abandon what you possess abandon your house and build a boat instead seek life instead of riches save yourself take with you on the boat you build an instance of each thing living so that they may be safe from obliteration in the flood perform the construction of the boat with care let the length of the boat and the width of the boat be equal roof over the boat as the abyss is roofed the whispering voice spoke through the rustling walls you reed house walls listen and hear what i say i listened and heard and spoke to the whispering voice 'i hear what you say what will i tell the others what will i tell the old men and the people ea the god whispered to me his servant 'tell them you can no longer live in the city because you are out of favor with enlil the city is the city of enlil and therefore utnapishtim whom he hates must find another domicile and another god who will be his patron and protector and you have therefore decided to depart from shuruppak and seek another home tell them ea the god will be your patron whose domicile is apsu the abyss under the roof of apsu is where you go as for the city fortunate shuruppak in the morning dawning abundance will then rain down there will be plenty a flood of bounty the city teeming with heaven 's profusion game birds falling fishes unheard-of before in song or story tumbling loaves of fresh-baked morning bread grain will come showering in from all the grain fields a harvest of everything yes more than enough these are the things to tell the elders and people ii '' in the first hours of the early morning dawning all the people came out for the boat-building the little children the weak as well as the strong everyone carrying something asphalt and oil and pitch the best of timber with which to build day after day i labored building the boat ten times a dozen cubits were the walls ten times a dozen cubits was each deck there were six decks the cabin was divided into nine compartments i made up the plans i drew a picture of them for our guidance i hammered the boat together and plugged the holes with water plugs to keep the water out i made the bitumen pitch in the pitch kiln three sar of bitumen pitch to caulk the hull and to be certain three sar to caulk the inside i counted punting poles and put them aboard i had the basket bearers stow the supplies of oil and foodstuffs everything i needed as for the people who came to help in the work each day was like a new year 's holiday i slaughtered sheep and bullocks for their feasting for drinking there was wine and beer plenty as if there was a river overflowing on the seventh day i finished building the boat i opened a bowl of ointment for my hands i commanded the loading of everything i owned that could be carried silver and gold and all the instances of living things to be saved from obliteration in the flood and all my household people i took with me at sunset on that day i launched the boat the launching was very hard to manage it took much shifting and much maneuvering on the ways to get the unwieldy boat down into the river and two-thirds of its weight under the water in order to prevent it from capsizing as darkness was coming on i heard the god 'abundance will rain down more than enough get yourself inside and close the hatch i saw the signs of morning in the sky 'abundance will rain down more than enough i got myself inside and closed the hatch to puzuramurri the caulker who outside caulked up the hatch with pitch i gave my house iii '' in the early hours of the next morning dawning there was the noise of adad in the clouds that rose and filled the morning sky with blackness shullat the herald of the dread adad moved out over the mountains and over the valleys bellowing hanish the herald of the dread adad moved over the plains and over the cities everything turned to darkness as to night from time to time the annunaki blazed terrible light then rain came down in floods beneath the god of the underworld nergal broke down his own doorposts and opened the earth ninurta god of chaos and of war opened the dikes and other floods burst forth the south wind rushed in flooding over the mountains brother could not see brother in the welter none of the gods in heaven could see the earth the land was shattered like a shattered pot confusions of dread adad were everywhere terrified gods got themselves up as high as they could go nearest the highest heaven cringing against the wall like beaten dogs ishtar cried out like a woman in her birth pangs the sweet-voiced lady cried `` the days that were have now become as featureless as clay because of what i said when i went to the gods in heaven bringing calamity down on those whom now the sea engulfs and overwhelms my children who are now the children of fish the annunaki sat and wept with her the cowering gods wept covering their mouths six days and nights the storm went on this way the south wind flooding over the mountains and valleys until the seventh day when the storm birth labor subsided at last the flood subsided at last i opened the hatch the daylight touched my face i looked outside nothing was moving at all it looked as flat as a flat clay roof looks flat and all the human beings had turned to clay i fell to my knees and wept the tears ran down the sides of my nose i wept in the total silence i looked outside and looked as far as i could trying to find looking across the world something and then far off something was there what looked like signs of an island could faintly be seen and then the boat was caught and held from under by the peak rock of a mountain under the water it was mount nisir the boat was grounded on a first day it was held and a second day a third day the boat was held from under and a fourth day and a fifth a sixth day and then on the seventh day i freed a dove the dove flew free and flew away from the boat seeking a place for its little feet to alight and finding none flew back to the boat to perch i freed a swallow then and it flew free and flew away from the boat seeking a place for its little feet to alight and finding none flew back to the boat to find a place to alight i freed a raven then and it flew free and flew away from the boat and never returned it had found a place to alight and circled about the place and alighted and settled itself and ate and never after that returned to the boat then i set free all the other birds in the boat and they flew free scattering to the winds iv '' i went ashore and offered a sacrifice i poured out a libation i set out seven vessels of offerings on a stand and then set seven more i made a fire of wood of myrtle wood of cane and wood of cedar i lit the fire the odor touched the nostrils of the igigi gods and gave them pleasure i slaughtered a sheep to make a sacrifice the gods collected like flies about the altar the great goddess progenitrix ishtar came down from heaven wearing about her neck the pendant anu gave her for her adornment of lapis lazuli ornately made she said 'just as this pendant never shall forgotten be by the goddess so the goddess never will forget calamitous days the gods may come to the ritual but forbidden is the presence of enlil by whose command the flood was peremptorily brought down on the heads of all my children engulfing them when the god enlil came to the sacrifice he saw the boat and the sight filled him with rage he spoke in anger to the gathered gods 'how is it that one man has saved himself no breath of life was meant to be kept safe from its obliteration in the flood ninurta opened his mouth and said to the god 'ea the cleverest of the gods deviser let ea speak and give enlil his answer then ea opened his mouth and said to the god '' the punishment should always fit the crime let him who has performed an evil act be punished for that act let not the flood be brought down on the heads of all for what one man has done and he who has transgressed show pity to him lest he be cut off from all his fellows better that a lion should come into the village and prey upon it taking a few than that the flood drown all better a wolf should find its ravening way into the fold devouring some much better than that the flood turn all that breathes to clay better that famine starve a few of them than that a harvest of waters obliterate all better that erra the plague god better that he take hold of some seize them and bear them away to the underworld than that the flood drown all i did not tell the secret to the man he listened to the wind and guessed the secret let the gods sitting in council now decide how to reward the wise man for his wisdom the god enlil then went on board the boat he took me by the hand and made me kneel he took my wife by the hand and made her kneel the god then touched our foreheads blessing us and said 'you were but human now you are admitted into the company of gods your dwelling place shall be the faraway the place which is the source of the outflowing of all the rivers of the world there are and so they led us to the faraway the place we dwell in now which is the source of all the rivers flowing through the world '' then scornful utnapishtim said to the king '' tell me who would bring all the gods together so that for you they might in council decide what your deserving is that you be granted admittance into the company of gods let there be now a test of gilgamesh let him but keep himself awake for a week six nights and seven days to show his worth '' so gilgamesh sat down to begin the test v almost as soon as gilgamesh the king sat down to test himself a mist of sleep as ocean mist comes over the shore from the waters came over his eyes and so the strongest slept then utnapishtim spoke to his wife and said '' see how this hero sleeps who asks for life as ocean mist blows over the land from the waters so the mist of sleep comes over the eyes of the king '' the wife of utnapishtim answered him '' touch and awaken him so that he may return in safety to his native city entering through the gate of his departure '' but utnapishtim said `` man is deceitful therefore he will deceive us every day as he lies sleeping you must bake a wafer and place the wafer near him making a mark upon the nearby wall for every day this hero sleeps who seeks eternal life '' she baked a wafer every day of bread for every day that gilgamesh lay sleeping the first wafer was dry as dust the second only less so than the first the third was soggy and rotten the fourth wafer was white in the crust there were spots of mold on the fifth the sixth wafer looked almost as if it was fresh and the seventh—gilgamesh started and waked up as utnapishtim touched him on the forehead gilgamesh said `` i had almost fallen asleep when you reached out and touched me and kept me awake '' but utnapishtim said to gilgamesh '' look at the wafers and look at the marks on the wall a mark and a wafer for every day you have slept the first wafer is dry as dust the second is only less so than the first the third is soggy and rotten the fourth wafer is white in the crust there are spots of mold on the fifth the sixth wafer looks almost as if it is fresh and the seventh—but it is then that you awoke '' then gilgamesh said to him `` what shall i do who takes us away has taken hold of me death is in my chamber when i sleep and death is there wherever i set foot '' vi utnapishtim said to the boatman then '' though your delight has been to cross the waters the harbor now is closed the crossing forbidden the waters and the shore now shun the boatman the hairy-bodied man you brought across the perilous waters wearing the skin of a beast that hides his beauty let urshànabi take him to the washing place there let him wash his body washing away the filth that hides his beauty manifest be the beauty of gilgamesh take the skin of a beast he wore on the journey and throw it away in the sea let gilgamesh bind up his shining hair with a new fillet let him put on a spotless festal robe let him return to his native city in honor in the royal garments appropriate to himself '' the boatman led the king to the washing place gilgamesh washed his body washing away the filth that obscured his beauty then urshànabi took the skin of a beast and threw it away manifest was the beauty of gilgamesh he bound up his shining hair with a new fillet he put on a festal robe utterly spotless a royal garment appropriate to himself then he and the boatman boarded the little boat and the boat began to move away from the shore but the wife of utnapishtim said to her husband '' this man has undergone a terrible journey what will you give him for his return to his city '' gilgamesh hearing took up his punting pole and brought the little boat back to the shore utnapishtim spoke and said to him '' gilgamesh you who have made the terrible journey what shall i give you for your return to your city '' then utnapishtim said to gilgamesh '' a secret of the gods i will disclose there is a plant that grows under the waters thorny to seize as a rose is thorny to seize how-the-old-man-once-again-becomes-a-young-man is the name of the plant that grows under the waters descend into the waters and seize the plant '' so gilgamesh tied heavy stone weights to his feet to bring him down through the waters of the abyss to the place where he could find the magic plant he seized the thorny plant that cut his hands he cut the stone weights loose from his heavy feet and the waters cast him up upon the shore vii gilgamesh said to urshànabi the boatman '' urshànabi this plant is a wonderful plant new life may be obtained by means of it i will carry the thorny plant back to my city i will give some of the plant to the elders there to share among them telling them it is called how-the-old-man-once-again-becomes-a-young-man and i will take my share of the magic plant once more to become the one who is youngest and strongest '' viii at twenty leagues they stopped only to eat at thirty leagues they stopped to rest for the night gilgamesh found a spring a pool of pure water he entered the water to refresh himself in the reeds nearby a serpent of the place became aware of the fragrance of the plant breathed its perfume desired it and approached and stole away with it among the reeds as it disappeared the serpent shed its skin when gilgamesh found out what the serpent had done he sat down weeping by the pool of water he took urshànabi by the hand and said '' what shall i do the journey has gone for nothing for whom has my heart 's blood been spent for whom for the serpent who has taken away the plant i descended into the waters to find the plant and what i found was a sign telling me to abandon the journey and what it was i sought for '' ix at twenty leagues they stopped only to eat at thirty leagues they stopped to rest for the night and so they traveled until they reached uruk there gilgamesh the king said to the boatman '' study the brickwork study the fortification climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace study how it is made from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields the ponds and orchards one league is the inner city another league is orchards still another the fields beyond over there is the precinct of the temple three leagues and the temple precinct of ishtar measure uruk the city of gilgamesh ''
in what sense i am i a minor observer as in a dream absorbed in the interior a beardless youth unaccountably remote yet present at the action reminding me faintly of prufrock a diminutive figure barely discernible seemingly ageless escapes me the original impulse to sing compressed into one exultant note breaks out of the chest-space vibrating along the shoulders in the presence of full-bodied womanliness the eyes dark in the inner scene the hair long and black our dark lady inmate of courtship she does not speak she is nameless the reason for her presence there is unknown a shepherd vaguely associated stands at a distance under a birch tree causally playing a flute sweetness streams across also from the balance and the position of each it issues neither moves the scene is not matter that can pall or diminish its secret holds as fast as i. as in giorgione the suspense is eternal

helen achieves the difficult task of translating a symbol in time into timeless-time or hieroglyph or ancient egyptian time she knows the script she says but we judge that this is intuitive or emotional knowledge rather than intellectual in any case a night-bird swooped toward them in their first encounter on the beach to achilles lately arrived from troy and the carnage of battle this is a `` carrion creature '' but helen would banish these memories she says she is `` instructed '' she is enchanted rather for from the depth of her racial inheritance she invokes as the perceptive visitor to egypt must always do the symbol or the `` letter '' that represents or recalls the protective mother-goddess this is no death-symbol but a life-symbol it is isis or her greek counterpart thetis the mother of achilles we huddled over the fire was there ever such a brazier a night-bird hooted past he started `` a curious flight a carrion creature — what— '' dear god let him forget i said `` there is mystery in this place i am instructed i know the script the shape of this bird is a letter they call it the hieroglyph strive not it is dedicate to the goddess here she is isis '' `` isis '' he said `` or thetis '' i said recalling remembering invoking his sea-mother flame i prayed flame forget forgive and forget the other let my heart be filled with peace let me love him as thetis his mother for i knew him i saw in his eyes the sea-enchantment but he knew not yet helen of sparta knew not helen of troy knew not helena hated of greece
at that time the sheep called to him from their wormy bellies as they lay bloating in the field he was a pastoralist the schoolhouse hardly handsize in a sky of flax he began then to keep the sayings of man the left hand writing the right hand crossing out farming the time by day with a great rake and in the evening hearing myths of the hurricane and the tornado straws driven through glass and of the waking in the grave the sharp hands of brothers buried together in the deep night the rat- traps in the seed room broke the rat's back and the rat called to him in the next room over in a penetrating eloquent way in the parlor it was always deep night where the separated organs of the living slept in jars the lank goiter and the rotted appendix awaiting the end-time when the emasculated ram will rise in the flax-blue sky cold as the final bluing of a sunday wash and all of us will know the use in beauty of the whole body in the hay field was the beginning of knowledge sour wine the great rake hoisted toward the high sun-altar of the stack and the hoist rope hauled out hard like a greased whip of which the stories told were of the severing of limbs by two staggering teams—and the whole sun in its extreme tower of noon all he heard was violent and sad but he kept on writing the sayings of man with his left hand and sent them off in broken words and waited in the mortal field listening to the mice in the bottom of the stack now though the schoolhouse hangs like a stone over the field robed in its winding sheet as blue as air the shepherd hand of eloquence still keeps and flashes out the sayings of the man— and the other the right hand of obliterating habit sleeps
when the corpse revived at the funeral the outraged mourners killed it and the soul of the revenant passed into the body of the poet because it had more to say he sat down at the piano no one could play called messiah or the regulator of the world which had stood for fifty years to my knowledge beneath a painting of a red-haired woman in a loose gown with one bared breast and played a posthumous work of the composer s—— about the impotence of god i believe who has no power not to create everything it was the autumn of the year and wet when the music started the musician was skillful but the messiah was out of tune and bent the time and the tone for a long hour the poet played the regulator of the world as the spirit prompted and entered upon the pathways of his power—while the mourners stood with slow blood on their hands astonished by the weird processional and the undertaker figured his bill —we have in mind an unplayed instrument which stands apart in a memorial air where the room darkens toward its inmost wall and a lady hangs in her autumnal hair at evening of the november rains and winds sublime out of the north and north by west are sowing from the death-sack of the seed the burden of her cloudy hip behold i send the demon i know to relieve your need an imperfect player at the perfect instrument who takes in hand the regulator of the world to keep the splendor from destroying us lady the last virtuoso of the composer s—— darkens your parlor with the music of the law when i was green and blossomed in the spring i was mute wood now i am dead i sing

god how i hate you you young cheerful men whose pious poetry blossoms on your graves as soon as you are in them nurtured up by the salt of your corruption and the tears of mothers local vicars college deans and flanked by prefaces and photographs from all you minor poet friends—the fools— who paint their sentimental elegies where sure no angel treads and living share the dead ’ s brief immortality oh christ to think that one could spread the ductile wax of his fluid youth to oxford ’ s glowing fires and take her seal so ill hark how one chants— “ oh happy to have lived these epic days ” — “ these epic days ” and he ’ d been to france and seen the trenches glimpsed the huddled dead in the periscope hung in the rusting wire chobed by their sickley fœtor day and night blown down his throat stumbled through ruined hearths proved all that muddy brown monotony where blood ’ s the only coloured thing perhaps had seen a man killed a sentry shot at night hunched as he fell his feet on the firing-step his neck against the back slope of the trench and the rest doubled up between his head smashed like and egg-shell and the warm grey brain spattered all bloody on the parados had flashed a torch on his face and known his friend shot breathing hardly in ten minutes—gone yet still god ’ s in his heaven all is right in the best possible of worlds the woe even his scaled eyes must see is partial only a seeming woe we can not understand god loves us god looks down on this out strife and smiles in pity blows a pipe at times and calls some warriors home we do not die god would not let us he is too “ intense ” too “ passionate ” a whole day sorrows he because a grass-blade dies how rare life is on earth the love and fellowship of men men sternly banded banded for what end banded to maim and kill their fellow men— for even huns are men in heaven above a genial umpire a good judge of sport won ’ t let us hurt each other let ’ s rejoice god keeps us faithful pens us still in fold ah what a faith is ours almost it seems large as a mustard-seed —we trust and trust nothing can shake us ah how good god is to suffer us to be born just now when youth that else would rust can slake his blade in gore where very god himself does seem to walk the bloody fields of flanders he so loves
o living pictures of the dead o songs without a sound o fellowship whose phantom tread hallows a phantom ground— how in a gleam have these revealed the faith we had not found we have sought god in a cloudy heaven we have passed by god on earth his seven sins and his sorrows seven his wayworn mood and mirth like a ragged cloak have hid from us the secret of his birth brother of men when now i see the lads go forth in line thou knowest my heart is hungry in me as for thy bread and wine thou knowest my heart is bowed in me to take their death for mine
our brains ache in the merciless iced east winds that knive us wearied we keep awake because the night is silent low drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient worried by silence sentries whisper curious nervous but nothing happens watching we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire like twitching agonies of men among its brambles northward incessantly the flickering gunnery rumbles far off like a dull rumour of some other war what are we doing here the poignant misery of dawn begins to grow we only know war lasts rain soaks and clouds sag stormy dawn massing in the east her melancholy army attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of grey but nothing happens sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow with sidelong flowing flakes that flock pause and renew we watch them wandering up and down the wind 's nonchalance but nothing happens pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our faces— we cringe in holes back on forgotten dreams and stare snow-dazed deep into grassier ditches so we drowse sun-dozed littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses —is it that we are dying slowly our ghosts drag home glimpsing the sunk fires glozed with crusted dark-red jewels crickets jingle there for hours the innocent mice rejoice the house is theirs shutters and doors all closed on us the doors are closed — we turn back to our dying since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn now ever suns smile true on child or field or fruit for god 's invincible spring our love is made afraid therefore not loath we lie out here therefore were born for love of god seems dying tonight this frost will fasten on this mud and us shrivelling many hands and puckering foreheads crisp the burying-party picks and shovels in shaking grasp pause over half-known faces all their eyes are ice but nothing happens
no one kneads us again out of earth and clay no one incants our dust no one blessèd art thou no one in thy sight would we bloom in thy spite a nothing we were are now and ever shall be blooming the nothing- the no-one's-rose with our pistil soul-bright our stamen heaven-waste our corona red from the purpleword we sang over o over the thorn

not a sign of life we rouse in any square close-shuttered house that flanks the road we amble down toward far trenches through the town the dark snow-slushy empty street ... tingle of frost in brow and feet ... horse-breath goes dimly up like smoke no sound but the smacking stroke of a sergeant flings each arm out and across to keep him warm and the sudden splashing crack of ice-pools broken by our track more dark houses yet no sign of life ... an axle ’ s creak and whine ... the splash of hooves the strain of trace ... clatter we cross the market place deep quiet again and on we lurch under the shadow of a church its tower ascends fog-wreathed and grim within its aisles a light burns dim ... when marvellous from overhead like abrupt speech of one deemed dead speech-moved by some superior will a bell tolls thrice and then is still and suddenly i know that now the priest within with shining brow lifts high the small round of the host the server ’ s tingling bell is lost in clash of the greater overhead peace like a wave descends is spread while watch the peasants ’ reverent eyes ... the bell ’ s boom trembles hangs and dies o people who bow down to see the miracle of calvary the bitter and the glorious bow down bow down and pray for us once more our anguished way we take toward our golgotha to make for all our lovers sacrifice again the troubled bell tolls thrice and slowly slowly lifted up dazzles the overflowing cup o worshipping fond multitude remember us too and our blood turn hearts to us as we go by salute those about to die plead for them the deep bell toll their sacrifice must soon be whole entreat you for such hearts as break with the premonitory ache of bodies whose feet hands and side must soon be torn pierced crucified sue for them and all of us who the world over suffer thus who have scarce time for prayer indeed who only march and die and bleed the town is left the road leads on bluely glaring in the sun toward where in the sunrise gate death honour and fierce battle wait
a sycamore on either side in whose lovely leafage cried hushingly the little winds — thus was mary ’ s shrine descried “ sixteen hundred and twenty-four ” legended above the door “ pray sweet gracious lady pray for our souls ” —and nothing more builded of rude gray stones and these scarred and marred from base to frieze with the shrapnel ’ s pounces—ah fair she braved war ’ s gaunt disease fair she pondered on the strange embitterments of latter change looking fair towards festubert cloven roof and tortured grange work of carving too there was once had been her reredos in this cool and peaceful cell that the hoarse guns blared across twisted oaken pillars graced with oaken amaranths interlaced in oaken garlandry had borne her holy niche—and now laid waste mary pray for us o pray in thy dwelling by this way what poor folks have knelt to thee we are no less poor than they
amazement fills my heart to-night amaze and awful fears i am a ship that sees no light but blindly onward steers flung toward heaven ’ s toppling rage sunk between steep and steep a lost and wondrous fight i wage with the embattled deep i neither know nor care at length where drives the storm about only i summon all my strength and swear to ride it out yet give i thanks despite these wars my ship—though blindly blown long lost to sun or moon or stars— still stands up alone i need no trust in borrowed spars my strength is yet my own
well how are things in heaven i wish you ’ d say because i ’ d like to know that you ’ re all right tell me have you found everlasting day or been sucked in by everlasting night for when i shut my eyes your face shows plain i hear you make some cheery old remark— i can rebuild you in my brain though you ’ ve gone out patrolling in the dark you hated tours of trenches you were proud of nothing more than having good years to spend longed to get home and join the careless crowd of chaps who work in peace with time for friend that ’ s all washed out now you ’ re beyond the wire no earthly chance can send you crawling back you ’ ve finished with machine-gun fire— knocked over in a hopeless dud-attack somehow i always thought you ’ d get done in because you were so desperate keen to live you were all out to try and save your skin well knowing how much the world had got to give you joked at shells and talked the usual “ shop ” stuck to your dirty job and did it fine with “ jesus christ when will it stop three years ... it ’ s hell unless we break their line. ” so when they told me you ’ d been left for dead i wouldn ’ t believe them feeling it must be true next week the bloody roll of honour said “ wounded and missing ” — that ’ s the thing to do when lads are left in shell-holes dying slow with nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache moaning for water till they know it ’ s night and then it ’ s not worth while to wake good-bye old lad remember me to god and tell him that our politicians swear they won ’ t give in till prussian rule ’ s been trod under the heel of england ... are you there ... yes ... and the war won ’ t end for at least two years but we ’ ve got stacks of men ... i ’ m blind with tears staring into the dark cheero i wish they ’ d killed you in a decent show
“ no one cares less than i nobody knows but god whether i am destined to lie under a foreign clod ” were the words i made to the bugle call in the morning but laughing storming scorning only the bugles know what the bugles say in the morning and they do not care when they blow the call that i heard and made words to early this morning
snow is a strange word no ice or frost have asked of bud or bird for winter 's cost yet ice and frost and snow from earth to sky this summer land doth know no man knows why in all men 's hearts it is some spirit old hath turned with malign kiss our lives to mould red fangs have torn his face god 's blood is shed he mourns from his lone place his children dead o ancient crimson curse corrode consume give back this universe its pristine bloom cape town 1914
in the east the day breaks do not say we have started too early for we shall cross many hills yet before we grow old here the land is surpassing in beauty mao tse tung 1934 i look out the bars upon the castle the crust caked row of age in a corner my friendly spider crouches for the unwary gnats of my days so much there is we must atone there are spires of faith in the invisible claws of spiders in the flight and curve of gulls these know i swear the contours of the rolling saharas and the destitute oceans of our history we sit debating the charity of our captors at night lights come on the shoreline bends into a broad bay near the castle the sea is gray yesterday it rained on the eve of my forty-first year and left all my defeats intact let me lead you into the country it is only as half clansman of the ritual goat that i bring my song to the place of sacrifice here in the pain fields asphalt and smoke of a large hearth i lead my rope is short i shall soon arrive under the tree i will stage a hundred fights in honor of our gods and our beloved leader here i could care less for the toiling masses i retreated here before lent to my own stretch of sea front i can not see the damned sea because of old caked walls built by dutchmen but the shore falls into a deep gulf there are no cliffs they found a week-old baby buried in a shallow grave on the front lawn of the fort i want my grave to be deeper they are sawing through our firewood today is cassava day the flutist is silent perhaps his troops have arrived in georgia not to arrive upsets me and for the path that i have trod i have no regrets
the weaver bird built in our house and laid its eggs on our only tree we did not want to send it away we watched the building of the nest and supervised the egg-laying and the weaver returned in the guise of the owner preaching salvation to us that owned the house they say it came from the west where the storms at sea had felled the gulls and the fishers dried their nets by lantern light its sermon is the divination of ourselves and our new horizon limits at its nest but we can not join the prayers and answers of the communicants we look for new homes every day for new altars we strive to rebuild the old shrines defiled by the weaver 's excrement
but this is ambiguous and so i will clarify last night i dreamt of a lake on fire a lovely woman tapered off into a fish i wore an owl mask with the desire to avoid use of his sacred name and then i came to those minced pronunciations like gad and gar and ged and gog and goles and golly and gom and gosh jolly and gud and gum and adad and adod and bedad and begad and ecod and egad and gadzooks and garzoon because gar is only used by playwrights who put it chiefly in the mouths of foreigners you said oh god my god good god followed by a good wish to that god of my ever-closing gaps for i receive god only ghostly that goodly god that guides the globe that god of love that god of war that god that blesses the god-blessed and the god-forsaken and the god-damned my god my shame is on me i said to the painterly painter my god my shame 's inside me and must go forth my body this beastbody this dogsbody this stony and bony bodykins that my god has plunged my soul into last night i hung from the vine from the branch from the noose until the sun stopped and the moon stood still until my nation took vengeance upon my enemies last night a piece of cake tumbled into our city and struck our walls until they fell then it rolled around and around until the entire city turned upside down meanwhile back at the lake i lapped silver water until dirt came out of my wounds until dirt came out of my mouth then i killed my lover montgomery in a new scatological satire last night nature ran hastily into its din enthusiastically into its prison wallowing in the flood of its patterning and randomness bedlam elected himself umpire and stood quickly in the midst of it arranging and disarranging the very laws of nature the earth vessel itself he plunged into the green and uneven horizon and all at once we entered a whole new world in the beginning the heavens and earth rose in the beginning we gave birth to the tiniest of errors in the beginning we watch for the rest of eternity as it blossoms and it blooms
to the young and able man who lets his death come in with veils in his face that say you can come in and claim a place among us to the young man who closes his eyes to the parting of clouds and lets what is beyond come in to the young man whose body is still warm that weightless being with halos whose footsteps we will never fill to the endless clock machine in the god body of the young man who closes his eyes as the light sweeps him to eternity to the blessed beating of his heart when we listen to our closed palms to the complex latticework of smiles in his photographs every two seconds you pick him up and back god body love good-bye to the young man whose laughter is now a memorial among us as we sit under tents listen to our mothers and sisters cry shed our own not-so-private god tears love shelter under the night that claimed him to him and beyond and the endless love through which god privately loves him
on the day i set out on the climb grief saddled in my back like a bag of marbles my breath like clouds hanging on the low peaks of a mountain on the day i set out leaving nothing behind nothing on the bed no version of myself just my voice through the night the voice i use to ward off nightmares my voice is a still life in itself a shroud green and ultramarine deep blue a bowl of apples and tangerines on a table on the day i set out the mountain is high in front of me the unreliable god of mist and fog i have no voice to say how high my fingers must lift as if on a lover 's upper lip to take in the breath of how high my mountain is—white teeth behind a snow cap numberless springs cold like the enzymes in spit— a version of me is still asleep the moving of a limb in sleep everything becomes lucid

because the only view we have is the one that looks down on the knees praise perspective praise shared disdain praise space made by connective tissue the synaptic cleft elbowroom at the dinner table polite conversation lies you push through your teeth because dissecting a dog 's heart wo n't change the way it thinks praise redirected traffic praise the gnarled lip that defends the gentle bones because your mother was a seahorse and to think of her thin is to empty all the ice from the tea glasses to strain the soup by driving it through your hand praise tablecloths sway-back chairs the plastic folds that protect slice after slice of cheese
i. serious smiles a lot at least that ’ s what they say his mum and pop trying to be proud as all the nurses gather round to squint into the cloud of little serious on the ultrasound it ’ s likely just the way he ’ s bent the head nurse finally thunders into the awe and argument swirling through the crowd where someone mutters half-aloud in all my years… serious never hears serious spins and spins with his dumb dolphin grin in the best bed there is where there ’ s no guilt and no sin no child more inner than this nothing to will and nothing to want no body you both are and haunt no drug of disappointment or feeling that there ’ s never now or do these seep in somehow no suffering the world ’ s idiocy like a saint its pains no traffic and no planes no debts no taxes no phones and no faxes no rockslide of information called the internet serious isn ’ t yet 2. serious hears a sound not unusual in itself nothing to be concerned about here and there there ’ s been a shout a song he seemed to be inside the weird whale-calls of her gas this too shall pass then it comes again and with a far-off force which a shrink less serious than he will have him dream is a drain that all his impurity is slowly drifting toward down serious says down beyond which he ’ ll be clean feel no pain… then the dark erupts in a rain of blood and muck he seems to mostly be holding on for all he ’ s worth which isn ’ t much finally little wizened thing plopping out to an earth where cries of agony dwindle to equivocal joy it ’ s it ’ s…is it a boy and some clear world lies just beyond the eyes you can ’ t quite open and everything is wet and loud and broken and all of life is one huge tit you ’ re meant to somehow suck serious staggers to his feet slaps himself harder than the doctor did and says i ’ m fucked 3. serious is learning silence in the way most children learn to speak poshlust he gasps after his first feeding götterdämmerung in his first dusk his whole body writhing with a kind of violence as if the world had wounded him words his bleeding anomie deus absconditus drift into the air above his crib accursed progenitor quintessence of dust dribble with the pap onto his bib as day by day and week by week serious wrestles with this difficult gift forgetting which it seems he is on this earth to do boob ass oaf riving out of him like greatness going off ninny crackpate clunkhead gorm leaving him gasping and bent fragments sheep rabble all falling falling from him backwards into babble ... finally serious lies there spent language like some immense ghostly mobile bobbing just above his bed all power of movement gone as well useless little buglike arms buglike little fingers this heavy heavy head and now if there ’ s something serious can ’ t quite taste or if he feels too acutely his own waste or knows too acutely what he can ’ t tell he screams and screams until the world knows what serious means 4. serious goes to school just try it his mum says as she lets go his hand and wipes a last glaze of doughnut from his nose and serious insofar as serious can does give it a good try though it ’ s hard to understand why they keep taking a break from taking breaks or why they can ’ t simply walk in line down the hall or what finally is at stake in a game of kickball it ’ s time to draw a tree what a relief to work alone serious thinks as he picks a scab for just the right tinge of sky breaks his sugar cookie to make a place of stone and fashions out of bread a man with a huge head and huge ruined wings gasping at all the ruined things to which he ’ s tumbled and calls it cookie crumbled oh my the teacher says when she walks by those are interesting trees serious closes his eyes and sees as in a vision of doom himself drowning in schools a whole ocean of fools nipping nipping at him with their tiny tiny teeth and serious sighs with a prophet ’ s wisdom as he climbs up into his seat stares out across the room and like a prophet cries you ’ re all going to die the class is a tomb serious rigid waits a girl in pigtails giggles then another near the back and as if along a fuse the giggling goes up and down the rows till someone makes a crack about his coat and tie and the laughter detonates serious climbs slowly down into that inferno of sound which the teacher ’ s shouts are only driving higher packs up his lunchbox his dignity and his copy of sartre and strides with a prophet ’ s gaze through all that derisive fire only once does he turn briefly to look back through the blaze at the iron fact of his art smaller from here but unburned 5. serious loves his mum and then he doesn ’ t quite it ’ s that way with everything— baths and plums the blessèd silence of night would you like to help with this his mother asks as she rolls out biscuit dough and cuts it with a glass or folds the clothes still warm from the sun but serious knows he was born with a task and though he touches the clothes and tastes the dough serious says no serious stays in the bath until his skin is shriveled and cold eats himself sick on plums feels in the dark the dark he becomes and cries out in the night for his mum 6. serious is older now he just is thank god serious says for whom childhood that stupid carousel that never stops always had an element of disingenuousness the tristesse of lollipops the sham of naps fools dandling you on their laps so you can play horsey which damn sure isn ’ t serious and all that endless business of pretending to be curious about the most obvious things what ’ s night where ’ s mama-cat what ’ s wrong with pop can god die why why why to hell with that serious thinks as he sits incinerating memories one by one saying their names as he feeds them like photographs to a fire here he is in a baseball uniform squinting back the sun here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front and here lord with pimples he pauses a moment do memories have names and what exactly are these flames to hell with that done serious owns a car pays taxes contemplates a pension has a crease of gray along his temples but he is young young he develops headaches begins sleeping badly and relaxes you might say into the constant tension that he really always was with far far too much to do to look anywhere but onward or to answer the questions of a child with anything true 7. serious isn ’ t stupid though they go to the same gym serious sees him dropping weights or picking his butt and thinks at least i ’ m not him nor is he mean or vain those chiseled twins with matching boots and belts nor smug who notes their sins nor shallow noting something else he isn ’ t useless timid who no matter what won ’ t complain nor fat-assed nice sweating honey on all the machines nor self-loathing who smudges mirrors nor whacked who licks them clean serious isn ’ t funny serious spreads his towel on the bench sits down in front of his own image and serious strains at a serious weight and never not once when he ’ s seen in myriad mirrors around the room that everyone else is straining too has he caught himself too late and finished with a roar and more strength than he ’ s ever had before i am not you 8. serious has a date with doom it ’ s not the first and seems unlikely to be the last for they get on quite well doom and he share similar pasts and similar ideas about what life should be it seems in fact that this might just bloom and what a relief after morose and mad and neurotic after almost falling for grief who was so exotic she made all the others seem tame then to discover she even lied about her name and to sleep with another serious that was odd like wrestling with an angel though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle which one was serious and which one god but how easy it is to be himself with doom serious thinks as he puts the wine in to chill and sets two glasses on a tray who always wants whatever serious wants and always agrees with what he has to say who doesn ’ t need to hear that whole spiel about “ going too fast ” or “ needing more room ” and who doesn ’ t probe and pry that long needle into his brain —what do you feel what do you feel — until it ’ s all serious can do not to stand up and scream pain lucky to be alive and if he still has no clear idea where she lives and never knows quite when she ’ ll arrive still something about doom feels right to serious and he looks forward to their dates he checks himself in the mirror dims the light and waits 9. serious is a traveler “ traveling broadens the mind ” the man beside him says his tray table down and seat reclined even as they 're taking off and serious who has his eyes closed so he can do what serious does begins to cough what do they say what do they fear is this song joy or grief this is a man this is a god who are you and why are you here to leave to leave the meal is over which serious declined in the shell-roar of the cabin he eases somewhat is surprised to find he could almost drift away “ what line of work are you in ” he hears the man beside him say and serious begins coughing wildly again what is that smell what was that sound isn ’ t that ice on the wings this is the air there is the water but what do you do on the way down you scream you scream how far they must have gone by now that old familiar world miles behind the man eats an orange and now he eats the rind he eats his plate his plastic fork chews with animal relish his styrofoam cup leans over to eat bittersweet serious too who startles and wakes up look at the desert look at the green is there an end to that ice here is a place and here is a place but what is the space between it ’ s life it ’ s life 10. serious is married what a weird wind this is he thinks so still at times then stinging the eyes to tears and how he seems both more and less himself and how it seems at once all of loneliness and something he can hold or is it he who 's being carried he shivers and reaches out for her again or is it she who reaches she who 's cold what is this wind where are these years 11. serious experiences loss just like that flat serious experiences loss as if he ’ d come to some sheer cliff there was no way around no way to cross and found on the other side of a deep canyon himself experiencing loss serious when the man is gone tells himself that he tried tells himself that he cried and cried for all he was worth to the man sitting on the other side experiencing loss who one day simply vanished or moved on or slipped off the edge of the earth and died 12. serious doesn ’ t speak french this embarrasses serious because insofar as he lives anywhere serious lives in paris he feels the city stare feels himself sweat and shake as he tries to wrench the little that he ’ s gleaned into the lot that he desires feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar waiters as if he were unclean and feels in truth not at all serious as if he had a huge balloon for a head and helium squeaks for a voice as if gravity could be merely a choice he were making and he might instead simply stop let go and drift away finally serious opposed to epiphanies has one he can ’ t resist he is serious and to be serious is to know something utterly or not at all and to know moreover that as you let your half-knowledge fall from you it does not exist just like that serious is himself again saying weighty things about the flowers in the stalls pondering a splendid mirage called the seine and if he wakes saying fromage or in some shop feels right on the verge of translating please serious knows it ’ s a dream and knows from childhood what to do point and scream until the damn fools give you cheese 13. serious has some culture he knows some things and if as he begins to speak he should feel the immense wings of ignorance shadowing him that dirty vulture that squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice serious knows what shelter to seek pick a name and bach is better modernism was powerful but diffuse life ’ s drained out of pictures since the renaissance technique technique technique and about all that spastic flatulence called contemporary art well serious hardly knows where to start serious sits through opera without a yawn chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter he can tell you where one brushstroke lies list the reasons courtly love is gone pluck the speck of subject matter from henry james serious knows some things he thinks and thinks and thinks until his ignorance shrinks to the tiniest of flies alighting somewhere in the louvre carefully carefully serious creeps with his massive swatter saying don ’ t move don ’ t move 14. serious believes in nothing it ’ s a nice day what should we do what are you thinking what ’ s been bothering you what ’ s that you ’ re drinking serious spreads the paper on his lap to confirm what ’ s new under the sun hears a tap tap tap against the windowpane nothing ventured nothing gained floats up from childhood like a bit of ash and serious pausing can almost see his old preacher that atom bomb of idiocy who every sunday would explode still serious thinks there ’ s a truth to set you free but who could survive the blast tap tap tap serious skims the sports pages reads about a storm that rages far out at sea some talking dog is taking office some country wiping out monuments expunging its past tap tap tap goddammit serious says midway through a war and thinks again of that old bore who talked and talked and talked until you felt your head loll and sway like some huge flower on a tiny stalk that one good breeze would break and how you ’ d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak chicken fried man with a tiny transistor radio in his hand so he could listen to the football game and how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain if he saw you coming to his booth and he stared off as if some great truth were finally finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain and like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout— until what plopped innocuously out was your own name tap tap tap serious puts aside the news of the day and walks to the only window there is but there ’ s no wind not even the grass stirs and anyway there ’ s no tree serious shrugs and turns away must just be me 13. serious sees a child in the playground across the street sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet as he tries to keep up with the games and hears his sonar screams of delight amid the other children 's screams and hears his timid weeping when they call him names serious sees the child standing apart sometimes driveling to himself in silly rhymes and sees him pretend to look intently at the sky if serious walks by or sees him simply stop and stare gradually serious starts seeing the child everywhere in a store standing in an aisle in the subway while serious is trying to work on the way home or laughing with his family in a restaurant where serious eats alone serious knows the truth this child wants something his whole nature is want and it begins to be annoying this novice cringing all the imbecilic and cloying tactics of being cute the whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity with his freckles and his missing tooth sitting all fidgety in his sunday suit or babbling happily as he ’ s leaking snot and then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious when it ’ s so obvious he ’ s not serious sees the child in the playground standing to the side sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide as serious crosses the street and strides until his shadow swallows the child and leans down close enough for them to kiss i don ’ t have time for this serious says i ’ ve got too much to do and the child says who are you 16. serious kills himself no no shivering out of a dream starlight and the hard glitter under the bridge ’ s beam serious serious don ’ t go serious crawls out of bed feels the cold in the floor and thinks suddenly of lovely mad where can she be who ’ d bolt out of sleep and scream farmers get up at four it ’ s three serious makes himself a cup of coffee which he doesn ’ t drink tries and fails to read tries and fails to think serious sits and holds himself still minute by minute until the dawn finally comes and he is in it 17. serious lives alone it ’ s better this way he tells himself as he takes a pan from the pan shelf a spatula from the spatula drawer and fries two eggs the way he likes them yolks of stone no more gnats of chatter over breakfast no more breakfast it ’ s noon no one prancing by with only panties on when he ’ s almost almost broken through or singsonging outside his door serious o serious where are you no more but what finally does serious do he sits ignores the ringing phone looks at a wall on one of the last warm days of the year and settles back into the lifelong call of being serious which is to see within that whiteness leaves being gently blown and to feel their colors as they fall 18. serious gives a speech he sets his papers on the podium his glass within easy reach tap tap taps the microphone how vast this venue is how absolute this darkness to be serious is to be alone serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face waiting for the echoes to end out there in all that space which the words at once define and extend it takes a while but they do die the spotlight lasers in he blinks hard starts again to know in every hand another ’ s touch to hear a silence words only intensify to feel not too little but too much this attenuated world— serious begins to sweat feels the back of his shirt grow wet looks down to see his papers swirled and scattered the glass on the floor broken what ’ s with this fucking light he thinks or was it spoken he glares out at the dark impassive crowd and as if by force he could make them wake hears his voice growing loud whatever you most treasure you will break whatever you hold closest you will let go there is no place that you will not leave but to be serious— serious says quietly now because he has them they are his— to be serious to be truly serious is to know that what you call your losses you can not grieve for it was never quite these things that you wanted —this treasure this touch this one place— but by such life to be haunted brilliant no notes no flaws serious stands back and waits for applause the hall is silent utterly silent the heat tropic serious looks around confused turns to the man who introduced him then can ’ t remember being introduced and even given his credentials this suddenly seems a most unlikely topic serious tries to get out of the light but the light goes where serious goes he blunders to the edge of the stage a cliff breaking off into a dark in which there 's no movement no voices not one sigh serious feels the rage draining out of him and feels a chill and whispers where am i 19. serious nears an end it ’ s cold and getting colder and serious older sits outside thinking of his good friend who like so much of serious is gone and thinking of that godforsaken dawn after the one night of his life he spent outdoors tell me his good friend said when serious staggered out to the fire which form would you say is higher tragedy or comedy and serious who had stumbled full-bladdered in the night from a dream of bears then dreamed himself the object of a dozen hungry stares who had swiveled pissed into the tent and sworn such things it would take a life to repent serious exhausted serious was silent because it ’ s been troubling me serious that the answer can only be tragedy to be conscious is to be conscious of losing whatever it is that you most love and thus an art that 's truly great will always have one deepest truth to tell which is my friend this life is hell serious looks at the sky it ’ s late a small wind blows the trees and serious shivering knows he should head inside that he is not well but sitting here letting his eyes close serious can almost see that lake aflame with the early sun and smell the sweet burn of that wood and feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break were it not for the strange lightness in his head as his friend smiled and said but maybe earth is the heaven of the good 20. serious talks to god there ’ s no one else left his mind is mash his world is ash and serious occasionally forgets himself though he is not not bereft that sniveling idiot two doors down who sits up late with only ashes in the grate and talks to god see serious says see nothing serious spreads his arms magnanimously as if to give god the floor god declines thou know ’ st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry serious says louder than before and then we wawl and cry some more and then we die and then we rot again he waits in case there ’ s disagreement there ’ s not serious scoffs goes to brush his teeth forgets briefly to avert his eye from the mirror ’ s glare and finds his father there that gentle baffled man who when there was no hope when he couldn ’ t even stand carved from a piece of soap a silly yellow duck and set it in a little yellow dish serious feels a tingling in his hair and mutters something close to a prayer i wish i wish ... the lights go out goddammit serious shouts as he trips and falls to his knees on the floor banging his head on the door as he tries to rise goddammit serious cries the lights come on his father ’ s gone but there at the edge of the sink balances the little duck in the little dish no serious person would ever keep serious tries to think steadies himself as if at some brink decides he needs sleep that ’ s what he needs crawling fully clothed into his bed and pulling the covers to his chin because it seems there ’ s some strange wind that ’ s somehow gotten inside so unlike serious to leave a door unclosed yet here it is gathering strength as it blows his books on the floor and it blows right through his body and it blows behind and below and above and out of the whirlwind a voice cries love what serious says as he tries to sit upright and looks wildly around him raising his fist in the air the things ... i have lost— immediately he is tossed back against the wall by the force of a storm that has no source no form and hears again the call out of nowhere love my god serious screams unable to help himself what maundering politician what decerebrated pop star what stupid puling poet couldn ’ t tell me that struggling to get out of bed he starts to cough then choke a riot in his heart a riot in his head as he falls off the edge to the floor who do you think you are he gasps is this ... is this some sort of joke suddenly the strange wind is quiet but no less strange the calm that comes after i ’ m serious the voice says and serious dies of laughter epilogue the dead man ’ s famous no one now remembers him alive or knows his name or anything he did still a few stories survive after all this while of a weird-looking man with a weird-looking smile that had it ’ s said almost a kind of life to it though the man was seriously dead and some remember how all the flies vanished for miles and some say no no but the buzzards had weird smiles as if they knew something and some tell of an old woman who would come and whisper in the dead man ’ s ear and smooth the dead man ’ s hair and if the door opened disappear there are even stories of that grim mortician who thought the smile undignified and tugged and tugged so hard he slipped and fell inside right on top of the dead man whose lips he swore seemed to soften seemed to somehow kiss and some remember this before the lid was sealed on that coffin and the nails driven there were on that face real tears and some say he smiled like a man forgiven the dead man never hears the dead man spins and spins with his dumb dolphin grin through all the places where he is when people talk of him again in classrooms or in planes in boredom or in pain in front of screens or in the spotlight ’ s glare in days too mild to bear and in the long nights where the dark grows steep the wind wild and a mother rises from her sleep to calm her serious child
there is a difference it used to make seeing three swans in this versus four in that quadrant of sky i am not imagining it was very large as its effects were declarations of war the timing fixed upon for a sea- departure or about love a sudden decision not to to pretend instead to a kind of choice it was dramatic as it should be without drama what is ritual i look for omens everywhere because they are everywhere to be found they come to me like strays like the damaged something that could know better and should therefore—but does not a form of faith you 've said i call it sacrifice—an instinct for it or a habit at first that becomes required the way art can become eventually all we have of what was true you should n't look at me like that like one of those saints on whom the birds once settled freely

home then where the past was then where cold pastorals repeated their entreaties where a portrait of christ hung in every bedroom then was a different country in a different climate in a time when souls were won and lost in prairie tents it was it was then it was a dream i had no will there then the new continent and the new wife and the new language for no for unsaved for communion on credit then the daughter who should ’ ve been mine and the hour a shadow outgrew its body she was all of my failures my sermon on the tender comforts of hatred in the shape of a girl then the knowledge of god like an apple in the mouth i faced my temptation i touched its breasts with as much restraint as my need allowed and i woke with its left hand traced again and again on my chest like a cave wall disfigured by right-handed gods who tried to escape the stone it was holy it was fading my ring then on my finger like an ambush as alive as fire then the trees offered me a city in the shape of a word followed by a word followed by a blue madonna swinging from the branches a choir filed out of the jungle singing hallelujah like a victory march and it was
it ’ s a little-known fact that god ’ s headgear — a magician ’ s collapsible silk top hat when viewed from earth from the bottom up — is sub specie aeternitatis a pluperfect halo both circle and square and a premonition of this truth spurred on an ancient philosopher anaxagoras to make numerous vain attempts to approximate the circle of his concerns with the square of the cell he was jailed in for impiety doomed calculations which god acknowledged by doffing then pancaking his topper he was still bareheaded millennia later when he learned of von lindemann ’ s proof that pi is not the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients hence squaring the circle ’ s impossible god un-collapsed re-donned his hat but — it was 1882 progress was a juggernaut and the public had no patience for “ proof. ” from below god ’ s gesture looked like a signal for all hat- and cap-wearing men proper in their headgear for nations well-stocked with helmets for delicate brainwork to take up “ the compass and straightedge ” and prepare for a singular all-out attack on this seductive conundrum so men enlisted en masse in geometry ’ s army tossing up and away all hats of cloth opaque haloes hurray

it 's the ragged source of memory a tarpaper-shingled bungalow whose floors tilt toward the porch whose back yard ends abruptly in a weedy ravine nothing special a chain of three bedrooms and a long side porch turned parlor where my great-grandfather pomp smoked every evening over the news a long sunny kitchen where annie his wife measured cornmeal dreaming through the window across the ravine and up to shelby hill where she had borne their spirited high-yellow brood in the middle bedroom 's hard high antique double bed the ghost of aunt jane the laundress who bought the house in 1872 though i call with all my voices does not appear nor does pomp 's ghost with whom one of my cousins believes she once had a long and intimate unspoken midnight talk he told her though they 'd never met that he loved her promised her raw widowhood would heal without leaving a scar the conveniences in an enclosed corner of the slant-floored back side porch were the first indoor plumbing in town aunt jane put them in incurring the wrath of the woman who lived in the big house next door aunt jane left the house to annie whose mother she had known as a slave on the plantation so annie and pomp could move their children into town down off shelby hill my grandmother her brother and five sisters watched their faces change slowly in the oval mirror on the wall outside the door into teachers faces golden with respect here geneva the randy sister damned their colleges daubing her quicksilver breasts with gifts of perfume as much as love as much as a visit to the grave of a known ancestor the homeplace moves me not to silence but to righteous praise jesus song oh catfish and turnip greens hot-water cornbread and grits oh musty much-underlined bibles generations lost to be found to be found
high on a throne of royal state which far outshon the wealth of ormus and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showrs on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat by merit rais'd to that bad eminence and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires beyond thus high insatiate to pursue vain warr with heav'n and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displaid powers and dominions deities of heav'n for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigor though opprest and fall'n i give not heav'n for lost from this descent celestial vertues rising will appear more glorious and more dread then from no fall and trust themselves to fear no second fate mee though just right and the fixt laws of heav'n did first create your leader next free choice with what besides in counsel or in fight hath bin achievd of merit yet this loss thus farr at least recover 'd hath much more establisht in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent the happier state in heav'n which follows dignity might draw envy from each inferior but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes formost to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark and condemns to greatest share of endless pain where there is then no good for which to strive no strife can grow up there from faction for none sure will claim in hell precedence none whose portion is so small of present pain that with ambitious mind will covet more with this advantage then to union and firm faith and firm accord more then can be in heav'n we now return to claim our just inheritance of old surer to prosper then prosperity could have assur 'd us and by what best way whether of open warr or covert guile we now debate who can advise may speak he ceas 'd and next him moloc scepter 'd king stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heav'n now fiercer by despair his trust was with th eternal to be deem'd equal in strength and rather then be less car 'd not to be at all with that care lost went all his fear of god or hell or worse he reck 'd not and these words thereafter spake my sentence is for open warr of wiles more unexpert i boast not them let those contrive who need or when they need not now for while they sit contriving shall the rest millions that stand in arms and longing wait the signal to ascend sit lingring here heav'ns fugitives and for thir dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay no let us rather choose arm 'd with hell flames and fury all at once o 're heav'ns high towrs to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer when to meet the noise of his almighty engin he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne it self mixt with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe let such bethink them if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumm not still that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat descent and fall to us is adverse who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our brok'n rear insulting and pursu 'd us through the deep with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low th ascent is easie then th event is fear 'd should we again provoke our stronger some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroy 'd what can be worse then to dwell here driv'n out from bliss condemn'd in this abhorred deep to utter woe where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger when the scourge inexorably and the torturing hour calls us to penance more destroy 'd then thus we should be quite abolisht and expire what fear we then what doubt we to incense his utmost ire which to the highth enrag 'd will either quite consume us and reduce to nothing this essential happier farr then miserable to have eternal being or if our substance be indeed divine and can not cease to be we are at worst on this side nothing and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heav'n and with perpetual inrodes to allarme though inaccessible his fatal throne which if not victory is yet revenge he ended frowning and his look denounc'd desperate revenge and battel dangerous to less then gods on th other side up rose belial in act more graceful and humane a fairer person lost not heav'n he seemd for dignity compos 'd and high exploit but all was false and hollow though his tongue dropt manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful yet he pleas 'd the ear and with perswasive accent thus began i should be much for open warr o peers as not behind in hate if what was urg'd main reason to perswade immediate warr did not disswade me most and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success when he who most excels in fact of arms in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution as the scope of all his aim after some dire revenge first what revenge the towrs of heav'n are fill'd with armed watch that render all access impregnable oft on the bordering deep encamp thir legions or with obscure wing scout farr and wide into the realm of night scorning surprize or could we break our way by force and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection to confound heav'ns purest light yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief and purge off the baser fire victorious thus repuls 'd our final hope is flat despair we must exasperate th almighty victor to spend all his rage and that must end us that must be our cure to be no more sad cure for who would loose though full of pain this intellectual being those thoughts that wander through eternity to perish rather swallowd up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night devoid of sense and motion and who knows let this be good whether our angry foe can give it or will ever how he can is doubtful that he never will is sure will he so wise let loose at once his ire belike through impotence or unaware to give his enemies thir wish and end them in his anger whom his anger saves to punish endless wherefore cease we then say they who counsel warr we are decreed reserv 'd and destin 'd to eternal woe whatever doing what can we suffer more what can we suffer worse is this then worst thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms what when we fled amain pursu 'd and strook with heav'ns afflicting thunder and besought the deep to shelter us this hell then seem'd a refuge from those wounds or when we lay chain 'd on the burning lake that sure was worse what if the breath that kindl 'd those grim fires awak 'd should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us what if all her stores were open 'd and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors threatning hideous fall one day upon our heads while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious warr caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl'd each on his rock transfixt the sport and prey of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk under yon boyling ocean wrapt in chains there to converse with everlasting groans unrespited unpitied unrepreevd ages of hopeless end this would be worse warr therefore open or conceal 'd alike my voice disswades for what can force or guile with him or who deceive his mind whose eye views all things at one view he from heav'ns highth all these our motions vain sees and derides not more almighty to resist our might then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles shall we then live thus vile the race of heav'n thus trampl 'd thus expell 'd to suffer here chains and these torments better these then worse by my advice since fate inevitable subdues us and omnipotent decree the victors will to suffer as to doe our strength is equal nor the law unjust that so ordains this was at first resolv 'd if we were wise against so great a foe contending and so doubtful what might fall i laugh when those who at the spear are bold and vent'rous if that fail them shrink and fear what yet they know must follow to endure exile or ignominy or bonds or pain the sentence of thir conquerour this is now our doom which if we can sustain and bear our supream foe in time may much remit his anger and perhaps thus farr remov'd not mind us not offending satisfi'd with what is punish't whence these raging fires will slack'n if his breath stir not thir flames our purer essence then will overcome thir noxious vapour or enur 'd not feel or chang 'd at length and to the place conformd in temper and in nature will receive familiar the fierce heat and void of pain this horror will grow milde this darkness light besides what hope the never-ending flight of future dayes may bring what chance what change worth waiting since our present lot appeers for happy though but ill for ill not worst if we procure not to our selves more woe thus belial with words cloath 'd in reasons garb counsel 'd ignoble ease and peaceful sloath not peace and after him thus mammon spake either to disinthrone the king of heav'n we warr if warr be best or to regain our own right lost him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fathe shall yeild to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter for what place can be for us within heav'ns bound unless heav'ns lord supream we overpower suppose he should relent and publish grace to all on promise made of new subjection with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble and receive strict laws impos 'd to celebrate his throne with warbl 'd hymns and to his god head sing forc't halleluia 's while he lordly sits our envied sovran and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers our servile offerings this must be our task in heav'n this our delight how wearisom eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate let us not then pursue by force impossible by leave obtain'd unacceptable though in heav'n our state of splendid vassalage but rather seek our own good from our selves and from our own live to our selves though in this vast recess free and to none accountable preferring hard liberty before the easie yoke of servile pomp our greatness will appeer then most conspicuous when great things of small useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse we can create and in what place so e're thrive under evil and work ease out of pain through labour and indurance this deep world of darkness do we dread how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heav'ns all-ruling sire choose to reside his glory unobscur 'd and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar must'ring thir rage and heav'n resembles hell as he our darkness can not we his light imitate when we please this desart soile wants not her hidden lustre gemms and gold nor want we skill or art from whence to raise magnificence and what can heav'n shew more our torments also may in length of time become our elements these piercing fires as soft as now severe our temper chang'd into their temper which must needs remove the sensible of pain all things invite to peaceful counsels and the settl 'd state of order how in safety best we may compose our present evils with regard of what we are and were dismissing quite all thoughts of warr ye have what i advise he scarce had finisht when such murmur filld th assembly as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustring winds which all night long had rous 'd the sea now with hoarse cadence lull sea-faring men orewatcht whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest such applause was heard as mammon ended and his sentence pleas 'd advising peace for such another field they dreaded worse then hell so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them and no less desire to found this nether empire which might rise by pollicy and long process of time in emulation opposite to heav'n which when beelzebub perceiv 'd then whom satan except none higher sat with grave aspect he rose and in his rising seem'd a pillar of state deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care and princely counsel in his face yet shon majestic though in ruin sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies his look drew audience and attention still as night or summers noon-tide air while thus he spake thrones and imperial powers off-spring of heav'n ethereal vertues or these titles now must we renounce and changing stile be call'd princes of hell for so the popular vote inclines here to continue and build up here a growing empire doubtless while we dream and know not that the king of heav'n hath doom'd this place our dungeon not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm to live exempt from heav'ns high jurisdiction in new league banded against his throne but to remaine in strictest bondage though thus far remov 'd under th inevitable curb reserv'd his captive multitude for he be sure in heighth or depth still first and last will reign sole king and of his kingdom loose no part by our revolt but over hell extend his empire and with iron scepter rule us here as with his golden those in heav'n what sit we then projecting peace and warr warr hath determin 'd us and foild with loss irreparable tearms of peace yet none voutsaf't or sought for what peace will be giv'n to us enslav 'd but custody severe and stripes and arbitrary punishment inflicted and what peace can we return but to our power hostility and hate untam 'd reluctance and revenge though slow yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest and may least rejoyce in doing what we most in suffering feel nor will occasion want nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heav'n whose high walls fear no assault or siege or ambush from the deep what if we find some easier enterprize there is a place if ancient and prophetic fame in heav'n err not another world the happy seat of some new race call 'd man about this time to be created like to us though less in power and excellence but favour 'd more of him who rules above so was his will pronounc 'd among the gods and by an oath that shook heav'ns whol circumference confirm 'd thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn what creatures there inhabit of what mould or substance how endu 'd and what thir power and where thir weakness how attempted best by force or suttlety though heav'n be shut and heav'ns high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength this place may lye expos'd the utmost border of his kingdom left to their defence who hold it here perhaps som advantagious act may be achiev'd by sudden onset either with hell fire to waste his whole creation or possess all as our own and drive as we were driven the punie habitants or if not drive seduce them to our party that thir god may prove thir foe and with repenting hand abolish his own works this would surpass common revenge and interrupt his joy in our confusion and our joy upraise in his disturbance when his darling sons huri 'd headlong to partake with us shall curse thir frail original and faded bliss faded so soon advise if this be worth attempting or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel first devis'd by satan and in part propos 'd for whence but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice to confound the race of mankind in one root and earth with hell to mingle and involve done all to spite the great creatour but thir spite still serves his glory to augment the bold design pleas 'd highly those infernal states and joy sparkl 'd in all thir eyes with full assent they vote whereat his speech he thus renews well have ye judg 'd well ended long debate synod of gods and like to what ye are great things resolv 'd which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up in spight of fate neerer our ancient seat perhaps in view of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heav'n or else in some milde zone dwell not unvisited of heav'ns fair light secure and at the brightning orient beam purge off this gloom the soft delicious air to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balme but first whom shall we send in search of this new world whom shall we find sufficient who shall tempt with wandring feet the dark unbottom 'd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his aerie flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt ere he arrive the happy ile what strength what art can then suffice or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round here he had need all circumspection and we now no less choice in our suffrage for on whom we send the weight of all and our last hope relies this said he sat and expectation held his look suspence awaiting who appeer'd to second or oppose or undertake the perilous attempt but all sat mute pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each in others count'nance read his own dismay astonisht none among the choice and prime of those heav'n-warring champions could be found so hardie as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage till at last satan whom now transcendent glory rais'd above his fellows with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth unmov 'd thus spake o progeny of heav'n empyreal thrones with reason hath deep silence and demurr seis 'd us though undismaid long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light our prison strong this huge convex of fire outrageous to devour immures us round ninefold and gates of burning adamant barr 'd over us prohibit all egress these past if any pass the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping and with utter loss of being threatens him plung 'd in that abortive gulf if thence he scape into whatever world or unknown region what remains him less then unknown dangers and as hard escape but i should ill become this throne o peers and this imperial sov'ranty adorn'd with splendor arm 'd with power if aught propos'd and judg 'd of public moment in the shape of difficulty or danger could deterr mee from attempting wherefore do i assume these royalties and not refuse to reign refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour due alike to him who reigns and so much to him due of hazard more as he above the rest high honourd sits go therfore mighty powers terror of heav'n though fall'n intend at home while here shall be our home what best may ease the present misery and render hell more tollerable if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive or slack the pain of this ill mansion intermit no watch against a wakeful foe while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all this enterprize none shall partake with me thus saying rose the monarch and prevented all reply prudent least from his resolution rais'd others among the chief might offer now certain to be refus 'd what erst they feard and so refus 'd might in opinion stand his rivals winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn but they dreaded not more th adventure then his voice forbidding and at once with him they rose thir rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote towards him they bend with awful reverence prone and as a god extoll him equal to the highest in heav'n nor fail 'd they to express how much they prais 'd that for the general safety he despis'd his own for neither do the spirits damn'd loose all thir virtue least bad men should boast thir specious deeds on earth which glory excites or clos ambition varnisht o 're with zeal thus they thir doubtful consultations dark ended rejoycing in thir matchless chief as when from mountain tops

truce to his restless thoughts and entertain the irksom hours till this great chief return part on the plain or in the air sublime upon the wing or in swift race contend as at th olympian games or

in the clouds before each van prick forth the aerie knights and couch thir spears till thickest legions close with feats of arms from either end of heav'n the welkin burns others with vast typhoean

heard and from his presence hid themselves among the thickest trees both man and wife till god approaching thus to adam call 'd aloud where art thou adam wont with joy to meet my coming seen far off i miss thee here not pleas 'd thus entertaind with solitude where obvious dutie erewhile appear 'd unsaught or come i less conspicuous or what change absents thee or what chance detains come forth he came and with him eve more loth though first to offend discount'nanc't both and discompos 'd love was not in thir looks either to god or to each other but apparent guilt and shame and perturbation and despaire anger and obstinacie and hate and guile whence adam faultring long thus answer 'd brief i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice affraid being naked hid my self to whom the gracious judge without revile repli 'd my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not fear 'd but still rejoyc't how is it now become so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat to whom thus adam sore beset repli 'd o heav'n in evil strait this day i stand before my judge either to undergoe my self the total crime or to accuse my other self the partner of my life whose failing while her faith to me remaines i should conceal and not expose to blame by my complaint but strict necessitie subdues me and calamitous constraint least on my head both sin and punishment however insupportable be all devolv 'd though should i hold my peace yet thou wouldst easily detect what i conceale this woman whom thou mad'st to be my help and gav'st me as thy perfet gift so good so fit so acceptable so divine that from her hand i could suspect no ill and what she did whatever in it self her doing seem 'd to justifie the deed shee gave me of the tree and i did eate to whom the sovran presence thus repli 'd was shee thy god that her thou didst obey before his voice or was shee made thy guide superior or but equal that to her thou did'st resigne thy manhood and the place wherein god set thee above her made of thee and for thee whose perfection farr excell'd hers in all real dignitie adornd shee was indeed and lovely to attract thy love not thy subjection and her gifts were such as under government well seem 'd unseemly to beare rule which was thy part and person had'st thou known thy self aright so having said he thus to eve in few say woman what is this which thou hast done to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm 'd confessing soon yet not before her judge bold or loquacious thus abasht repli 'd the serpent me beguil 'd and i did eate which when the lord god heard without delay to judgement he proceeded on th accus'd serpent though brute unable to transferre the guilt on him who made him instrument of mischief and polluted from the end of his creation justly then accurst as vitiated in nature more to know concern 'd not man since he no further knew nor alter 'd his offence yet god at last to satan first in sin his doom apply 'd though in mysterious terms judg 'd as then best and on the serpent thus his curse let fall because thou hast done this thou art accurst above all cattle each beast of the field upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe and dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy life between thee and the woman i will put enmitie and between thine and her seed her seed shall bruse thy head thou bruise his heel so spake this oracle then verifi'd when jesus son of mary second eve saw satan fall like lightning down from heav'n prince of the aire then rising from his grave spoild principalities and powers triumpht in open shew and with ascention bright captivity led captive through the aire the realm it self of satan long usurpt whom he shall tread at last under our feet eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise and to the woman thus his sentence turn 'd thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie by thy conception children thou shalt bring in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will thine shall submit hee over thee shall rule on adam last thus judgement he pronounc 'd because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy wife and eaten of the tree concerning which i charg 'd thee saying thou shalt not eate thereof curs 'd is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth unbid and thou shalt eate th herb of th field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for thou out of the ground wast taken know thy birth for dust thou art and shalt to dust returne so judg 'd he man both judge and saviour sent and th instant stroke of death denounc't that day remov 'd farr off then pittying how they stood before him naked to the aire that now must suffer change disdain 'd not to begin thenceforth the form of servant to assume as when he wash 'd his servants feet so now as father of his familie he clad thir nakedness with skins of beasts or slain or as the snake with youthful coate repaid and thought not much to cloath his enemies nor hee thir outward onely with the skins of beasts but inward nakedness much more opprobrious with his robe of righteousness araying cover 'd from his fathers sight to him with swift ascent he up returnd into his blissful bosom reassum'd in glory as of old to him appeas'd all though all-knowing what had past with man recounted mixing intercession sweet meanwhile ere thus was sin 'd and judg 'd on earth within the gates of hell sate sin and death in counterview within the gates that now stood open wide

havoc yonder world which i so fair and good created and had still kept in that state had not the folly of man let in these wastful furies who impute folly to mee so doth the prince of hell and his adherents that with so much ease i suffer them to enter and possess a place so heav'nly and conniving-seem to gratifie my scornful enemies that laugh as if transported with some fit of passion i to them had quitted all at random yielded up to their misrule and know not that i call 'd and drew them thither my hell-hounds to lick up the draff and filth which mans polluting sin with taint hath shed on what was pure till cramm 'd and gorg 'd nigh burst with suckt and glutted offal at one sling of thy victorious arm well-pleasing son both sin and death and yawning grave at last through chaos hurld obstruct the mouth of hell for ever and seal up his ravenous jawes then heav'n and earth renewd shall be made pure to sanctitie that shall receive no staine till then the curse pronounc't on both

next to the son destin 'd restorer of mankind by whom new heav'n and earth shall to the ages rise or down from heav'n descend such was thir song while the creator calling forth by name his mightie angels gave them several charge as sorted best with present things the sun had first his precept so to move so shine as might affect the earth with cold and heat scarce tollerable and from the north to call decrepit winter from the south to bring solstitial summers heat to the blanc moone her office they prescrib 'd to th other five thir planetarie motions and aspects in sextile square and trine and opposite of noxious efficacie and when to joyne in synod unbenigne and taught the fixt thir influence malignant when to showre which of them rising with the sun or falling should prove tempestuous to the winds they set thir corners when with bluster to confound sea aire and shoar the thunder when to rowle with terror through the dark aereal hall some say he bid his angels turne ascanse the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more from the suns axle they with labour push'd oblique the centric globe som say the sun was bid turn reines from th equinoctial rode like distant breadth to taurus with the seav'n atlantick sisters and the spartan twins up to the tropic crab thence down amaine by leo and the virgin and the scales as deep as capricorne to bring in change of seasons to each clime else had the spring perpetual smil 'd on earth with vernant flours equal in days and nights except to those beyond the polar circles to them day had unbenighted shon while the low sun to recompence his distance in thir sight had rounded still th horizon and not known or east or west which had forbid the snow from cold estotiland and south as farr beneath magellan at that tasted fruit the sun as from thyestean banquet turn'd his course intended else how had the world inhabited though sinless more then now avoided pinching cold and scorching heate these changes in the heav'ns though slow produc'd like change on sea and land sideral blast vapour and mist and exhalation hot corrupt and pestilent now from the north of norumbega and the samoed shoar bursting thir brazen dungeon armd with ice and snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw boreas and caecias and argestes loud and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn with adverse blast upturns them from the south notus and afer black with thundrous clouds from serraliona thwart of these as fierce forth rush the levant and the ponent windes eurus and zephir with thir lateral noise sirocco and libecchio thus began outrage from liveless things but discord first daughter of sin among th irrational death introduc 'd through fierce antipathie beast now with beast gan war and fowle with fowle and fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving devourd each other nor stood much in awe of man but fled him or with count'nance grim glar 'd on him passing these were from without the growing miseries which adam saw alreadie in part though hid in gloomiest shade to sorrow abandond but worse felt within and in a troubl 'd sea of passion tost thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint o miserable of happie is this the end of this new glorious world and mee so late the glory of that glory who now becom accurst of blessed hide me from the face of god whom to behold was then my highth of happiness yet well if here would end the miserie i deserv 'd it and would beare my own deservings but this will not serve all that i eat or drink or shall beget is propagated curse o voice once heard delightfully encrease and multiply now death to heare for what can i encrease or multiplie but curses on my head who of all ages to succeed but feeling the evil on him brought by me will curse my head ill fare our ancestor impure for this we may thank adam but his thanks shall be the execration so besides mine own that bide upon me all from mee shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound on mee as on thir natural center light heavie though in thir place o fleeting joyes of paradise deare bought with lasting woes did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i sollicite thee from darkness to promote me or here place in this delicious garden as my will concurd not to my being it were but right and equal to reduce me to my dust desirous to resigne and render back all i receav 'd unable to performe thy terms too hard by which i was to hold the good i sought not to the loss of that sufficient penaltie why hast thou added the sense of endless woes inexplicable thy justice seems yet to say truth too late i thus contest then should have been refusd those terms whatever when they were propos 'd thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good then cavil the conditions and though god made thee without thy leave what if thy son prove disobedient and reprov 'd retort wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee that proud excuse yet him not thy election but natural necessity begot god made thee of choice his own and of his own to serve him thy reward was of his grace thy punishment then justly is at his will be it so for i submit his doom is fair that dust i am and shall to dust returne o welcom hour whenever why delayes his hand to execute what his decree fixd on this day why do i overlive why am i mockt with death and length'nd out to deathless pain how gladly would i meet mortalitie my sentence and be earth insensible how glad would lay me down as in my mothers lap there i should rest and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ears no fear of worse to mee and to my ofspring would torment me with cruel expectation yet one doubt pursues me still least all i can not die least that pure breath of life the spirit of man which god inspir 'd can not together perish with this corporeal clod then in the grave or in some other dismal place who knows but i shall die a living death o thought horrid if true yet why it was but breath of life that sinn 'd what dies but what had life and sin the bodie properly hath neither all of me then shall die let this appease the doubt since humane reach no further knows for though the lord of all be infinite is his wrauth also be it man is not so but mortal doom 'd how can he exercise wrath without end on man whom death must end can he make deathless death that were to make strange contradiction which to god himself impossible is held as argument of weakness not of power will he draw out for angers sake finite to infinite in punisht man to satisfie his rigour satisfi 'd never that were to extend his sentence beyond dust and natures law by which all causes else according still to the reception of thir matter act not to th extent of thir own spheare but say that death be not one stroak as i suppos 'd bereaving sense but endless miserie from this day onward which 1 feel begun both in me and without me and so last to perpetuitie ay me that fear comes thundring back with dreadful revolution on my defensless head both death and i am found eternal and incorporate both nor i on my part single in mee all posteritie stands curst fair patrimonie that i must leave ye sons o were i able to waste it all my self and leave ye none so disinherited how would ye bless me now your curse ah why should all mankind for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn 'd if guiltless but from me what can proceed but all corrupt both mind and will deprav 'd not to do onely but to will the same with me how can they then acquitted stand in sight of god him after all disputes forc't i absolve all my evasions vain and reasonings though through mazes lead me still but to my own conviction first and last on mee mee onely as the sourse and spring of all corruption all the blame lights due so might the wrauth fond wish couldst thou support that burden heavier then the earth to bear then all the world much heavier though divided with that bad woman thus what thou desir'st and what thou fearst alike destroyes all hope of refuge and concludes thee miserable beyond all past example and future to satan only like both crime and doom o conscience into what abyss of fears and horrors hast thou driv'n me out of which i find no way from deep to deeper plung 'd thus adam to himself lamented loud through the still night not now as ere man fell wholsom and cool and mild but with black air accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom which to his evil conscience represented all things with double terror on the ground outstretcht he lay on the cold ground and oft curs 'd his creation death as oft accus'd of tardie execution since denounc't the day of his offence why comes not death said hee with one thrice acceptable stroke to end me shall truth fail to keep her word justice divine not hast'n to be just but death comes not at call justice divine mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries o woods o fountains hillocks dales and bowrs with other echo late i taught your shades to answer and resound farr other song whom thus afflicted when sad eve bebeld desolate where she sate approaching nigh soft words to his fierce passion she assay 'd but her with stern regard he thus repell 'd out of my sight thou serpent that name best befits thee with him leagu 'd thy self as false and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape like his and colour serpentine may shew thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee henceforth least that too heav'nly form pretended to hellish falshood snare them but for thee i had persisted happie had not thy pride and wandring vanitie when lest was safe rejected my forewarning and disdain'd not to be trusted longing to be seen though by the devil himself him overweening to over-reach but with the serpent meeting fool 'd and beguil 'd by him thou i by thee to trust thee from my side imagin 'd wise constant mature proof against all assaults and understood not all was but a shew rather then solid vertu all but a rib crooked by nature bent as now appears more to the part sinister from me drawn well if thrown out as supernumerarie to my just number found o why did god creator wise that peopl 'd highest heav'n with spirits masculine create at last this noveltie on earth this fair defect of nature and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine or find some other way to generate mankind this mischief had not then befall'n and more that shall befall innumerable disturbances on earth through femal snares and straight conjunction with this sex for either he never shall find out fit mate but such as some misfortune brings him or mistake or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain through her perversness but shall see her gaind by a farr worse or if she love withheld by parents or his happiest choice too late shall meet alreadie linkt and wedlock-bound to a fell adversarie his hate or shame which infinite calamitie shall cause to humane life and houshold peace confound he added not and from her turn 'd but eve not so repulst with tears that ceas 'd not flowing and tresses all disorderd at his feet fell humble and imbracing them besaught his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint forsake me not thus adam witness heav'n what love sincere and reverence in my heart i beare thee and unweeting have offended unhappilie deceav 'd thy suppliant i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid thy counsel in this uttermost distress my onely strength and stay forlorn of thee whither shall i betake me where subsist while yet we live scarse one short hour perhaps between us two let there be peace both joyning as joyn 'd in injuries one enmitie against a foe by doom express assign 'd us that cruel serpent on me exercise not thy hatred for this miserie befall'n on me alreadie lost mee then thy self more miserable both have sin 'd but thou against god onely i against god and thee and to the place of judgment will return there with my cries importune heaven that all the sentence from thy head remov 'd may light on me sole cause to thee of all this woe mee mee onely just object of his ire she ended weeping and her lowlie plight immoveable till peace obtain 'd from fault acknowledg 'd and deplor 'd in adam wraught commiseration soon his heart relented towards her his life so late and sole delight now at his feet submissive in distress creature so faire his reconcilement seeking his counsel whom she had displeas 'd his aide as one disarm 'd his anger all he lost and thus with peaceful words uprais 'd her soon unwarie and too desirous as before so now of what thou knowst not who desir'st the punishment all on thy self alas beare thine own first ill able to sustaine his full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part and my displeasure bearst so ill. if prayers could alter high decrees i to that place would speed before thee and be louder heard that on my head all might be visited thy frailtie and infirmer sex forgiv'n to me committed and by me expos 'd but rise let us no more contend nor blame each other blam 'd enough elsewhere but strive in offices of love how we may light'n each others burden in our share of woe since this days death denounc't if ought i see will prove no sudden but a slow-pac't evill a long days dying to augment our paine and to our seed o hapless seed deriv 'd to whom thus eve recovering heart repli 'd adam by sad experiment i know how little weight my words with thee can finde found so erroneous thence by just event found so unfortunate nevertheless restor 'd by thee vile as i am to place of new acceptance hopeful to regaine thy love the sole contentment of my heart living or dying from thee i will not hide what thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n tending to some relief of our extremes or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable as in our evils and of easier choice if care of our descent perplex us most which must be born to certain woe devourd by death at last and miserable it is to be to others cause of misery our own begotten and of our loines to bring into this cursed world a woful race that after wretched life must be at last food for so foule a monster in thy power it lies yet ere conception to prevent the race unblest to being yet unbegot childless thou art childless remaine so death shall be deceav 'd his glut and with us two be forc 'd to satisfie his rav'nous maw but if thou judge it hard and difficult conversing looking loving to abstain from loves due rites nuptial imbraces sweet and with desire to languish without hope before the present object languishing with like desire which would be meserie and torment less then none of what we dread then both our selves and seed at once to free from what we fear for both let us make short let us seek death or he not found supply with our own hands his office on our selves why stand we longer shivering under feares that shew no end but death and have the power of many ways to die the shortest choosing destruction with destruction to destroy she ended heer or vehement despaire broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts had entertaind as di 'd her cheeks with pale but adam with such counsel nothing sway 'd to better hopes his more attentive minde labouring had rais 'd and thus to eve repli 'd eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems to argue in thee somthing more sublime and excellent then what thy minde contemnes but self-destruction therefore saught refutes that excellence thought in thee and implies not thy contempt but anguish and regret for loss of life and pleasure overlov 'd or if thou covet death as utmost end of miserie so thinking to evade the penaltie pronounc't doubt not but god hath wiselier arm 'd his vengeful ire then so to be forestall 'd much more i fear least death so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine we are by doom to pay rather such acts of contumacie will provoke the highest to make death in us live then let us seek some safer resolution which methinks i have in view calling to minde with heed part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise the serpents head piteous amends unless be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe satan who in the serpent hath contriv'd against us this deceit to crush his head would be revenge indeed which will be lost by death brought on our selves or childless days resolv 'd as thou proposest so our foe shall scape his punishment ordain 'd and wee instead shall double ours upon our heads no more be mention 'd then of violence against our selves and wilful barrenness that cuts us off from hope and savours onely rancor and pride impatience and despite reluctance against god and his just yoke laid on our necks remember with what mild and gracious temper he both heard and judg'd without wrauth or reviling wee expected immediate dissolution which we thought was meant by death that day when lo to thee pains onely in child-bearing were foretold and bringing forth soon recompenc't with joy fruit of thy womb on mee the curse aslope glanc 'd on the ground with labour i must earne my bread what harm idleness had bin worse my labour will sustain me and least cold or heat should injure us his timely care hath unbesaught provided and his hands cloath 'd us unworthie pitying while he judg 'd how much more if we pray him will his ear be open and his heart to pitie incline and teach us further by what means to shun th inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow which now the skie with various face begins to shew us in this mountain while the winds blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek som better shroud som better warmth to cherish our limbs benumm 'd ere this diurnal starr leave cold the night how we his gather 'd beams reflected may with matter sere foment or by collision of two bodies grinde the air attrite to fire as late the clouds justling or pusht with winds rude in thir shock tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driv'n down kindles the gummie bark of firr or pine and sends a comfortable heat from farr which might supplie the sun such fire to use and what may else be remedie or cure to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought hee will instruct us praying and of grace beseeching him so as we need not fear to pass commodiously this life sustain'd by him with many comforts till we end in dust our final rest and native home what better can we do then to the place repairing where he judg 'd us prostrate fall before him reverent and there confess humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears watering the ground and with our sighs the air frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign of sorrow unfeign 'd and humiliation meek undoubtedly he will relent and turn from his displeasure in whose look serene when angry most he seem 'd and most severe what else but favor grace and mercie shon so spake our father penitent nor eve felt less remorse they forthwith to the place repairing where he judg 'd them prostrate fell before him reverent and both confess'd humbly thir faults and pardon beg 'd with tears watering the ground and with thir sighs the air frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign of sorrow unfeign

hail holy light ofspring of heav'n first-born or of th eternal coeternal beam may i express thee unblam 'd since god is light and never but in unapproached light dwelt from eternitie dwelt then in thee bright effluence of bright essence increate or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream whose fountain who shall tell before the sun before the heavens thou wert and at the voice of god as with a mantle didst invest the rising world of waters dark and deep won from the void and formless infinite thee i re-visit now with bolder wing escap't the stygian pool though long detain'd in that obscure sojourn while in my flight through utter and through middle darkness borne with other notes then to th orphean lyre i sung of chaos and eternal night taught by the heav'nly muse to venture down the dark descent and up to reascend though hard and rare thee i revisit safe and feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou revisit'st not these eyes that rowle in vain to find thy piercing ray and find no dawn so thick a drop serene hath quencht thir orbs or dim suffusion veild yet not the more cease i to wander where the muses haunt cleer spring or shadie grove or sunnie hill smit with the love of sacred song but chief thee sion and the flowrie brooks beneath that wash thy hallowd feet and warbling flow nightly i visit nor somtimes forget those other two equal 'd with me in fate so were i equal 'd with them in renown blind thamyris and blind maeonides and tiresias and phineus prophets old then feed on thoughts that voluntarie move harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid tunes her nocturnal note thus with the year seasons return but not to me returns day or the sweet approach of ev'n or morn or sight of vernal bloom or summers rose or flocks or heards or human face divine but cloud in stead and ever-during dark surrounds me from the chearful wayes of men cut off and for the book of knowledg fair presented with a universal blanc of natures works to mee expung 'd and ras 'd and wisdome at one entrance quite shut out so much the rather thou celestial light shine inward and the mind through all her powers irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence purge and disperse that i may see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight now had the almighty father from above from the pure empyrean where he sits high thron 'd above all highth bent down his eye his own works and their works at once to view about him all the sanctities of heaven stood thick as starrs and from his sight receiv'd beatitude past utterance on his right the radiant image of his glory sat his onely son on earth he first beheld our two first parents yet the onely two of mankind in the happie garden plac't reaping immortal fruits of joy and love uninterrupted joy unrivald love in blissful solitude he then survey'd hell and the gulf between and satan there coasting the wall of heav'n on this side night in the dun air sublime and ready now to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet on the bare outside of this world that seem'd firm land imbosom 'd without firmament uncertain which in ocean or in air him god beholding from his prospect high wherein past present future he beholds thus to his onely son foreseeing spake onely begotten son seest thou what rage transports our adversarie whom no bounds prescrib 'd no barrs of hell nor all the chains heapt on him there nor yet the main abyss wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems on desparate reveng that shall redound upon his own rebellious head and now through all restraint broke loose he wings his way not farr off heav'n in the precincts of light directly towards the new created world and man there plac't with purpose to assay if him by force he can destroy or worse by some false guile pervert and shall pervert for man will hark'n to his glozing lyes and easily transgress the sole command sole pledge of his obedience so will fall hee and his faithless progenie whose fault whose but his own ingrate he had of mee all he could have i made him just and right sufficient to have stood though free to fall such i created all th ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who faild freely they stood who stood and fell who fell not free what proof could they have givn sincere of true allegiance constant faith or love where onely what they needs must do appeard not what they would what praise could they receive what pleasure i from such obedience paid when will and reason reason also is choice useless and vain of freedom both despoild made passive both had servd necessitie not mee they therefore as to right belongd so were created nor can justly accuse thir maker or thir making or thir fate as if predestination over-rul'd thir will dispos 'd by absolute decree or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed thir own revolt not i if i foreknew foreknowledge had no influence on their fault which had no less prov 'd certain unforeknown so without least impulse or shadow of fate or aught by me immutablie foreseen they trespass authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose for so i formd them free and free they must remain till they enthrall themselves i else must change thir nature and revoke the high decree unchangeable eternal which ordain'd thir freedom they themselves ordain 'd thir fall the first sort by thir own suggestion fell self-tempted self-deprav 'd man falls deceiv'd by the other first man therefore shall find grace the other none in mercy and justice both through heav'n and earth so shall my glorie excel but mercy first and last shall brightest shine thus while god spake ambrosial fragrance fill'd all heav'n and in the blessed spirits elect sense of new joy ineffable diffus 'd beyond compare the son of god was seen most glorious in him all his father shon substantially express 'd and in his face divine compassion visibly appeerd love without end and without measure grace which uttering thus he to his father spake o father gracious was that word which clos'd thy sovran sentence that man should find grace for which both heav'n and earth shall high extoll thy praises with th innumerable sound of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne encompass 'd shall resound thee ever blest for should man finally be lost should man thy creature late so lov 'd thy youngest son fall circumvented thus by fraud though joynd with his own folly that be from thee farr that farr be from thee father who art judg of all things made and judgest onely right or shall the adversarie thus obtain his end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill his malice and thy goodness bring to naught or proud return though to his heavier doom yet with revenge accomplish't and to hell draw after him the whole race of mankind by him corrupted or wilt thou thy self abolish thy creation and unmake for him what for thy glorie thou hast made so should thy goodness and thy greatness both be questiond and blaspheam 'd without defence to whom the great creatour thus reply 'd o son in whom my soul hath chief delight son of my bosom son who art alone my word my wisdom and effectual might all hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are all as my eternal purpose hath decreed man shall not quite be lost but sav 'd who will yet not of will in him but grace in me freely voutsaft once more i will renew his lapsed powers though forfeit and enthrall'd by sin to foul exorbitant desires upheld by me yet once more he shall stand on even ground against his mortal foe by me upheld that he may know how frail his fall'n condition is and to me ow all his deliv'rance and to none but me some i have chosen of peculiar grace elect above the rest so is my will the rest shall hear me call and oft be warnd thir sinful state and to appease betimes th incensed deitie while offerd grace invites for i will cleer thir senses dark what may sufflce and soft'n stonie hearts to pray repent and bring obedience due to prayer repentance and obedience due though but endevord with sincere intent mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut and i will place within them as a guide my umpire conscience whom if they will hear light after light well us 'd they shall attain and to the end persisting safe arrive this my long sufferance and my day of grace they who neglect and scorn shall never taste but hard be hard'nd blind be blinded more that they may stumble on and deeper fall and none but such from mercy i exclude but yet all is not don man disobeying disloyal breaks his fealtie and sinns against the high supremacie of heav'n affecting god-head and so loosing all to expiate his treason hath naught left but to destruction sacred and devote he with his whole posteritie must dye dye hee or justice must unless for him som other able and as willing pay the rigid satisfaction death for death say heav'nly powers where shall we find such love which of ye will be mortal to redeem mans mortal crime and just th unjust to save dwels in all heaven charitie so deare he ask 'd but all the heav'nly quire stood mute and silence was in heav'n on mans behalf patron or intercessor none appeerd much less that durst upon his own head draw the deadly forfeiture and ransom set and now without redemption all mankind must have bin lost adjudg 'd to death and hell by doom severe had not the son of god in whom the fulness dwels of love divine his dearest mediation thus renewd father thy word is past man shall find grace and shall grace not find means that finds her way the speediest of thy winged messengers to visit all thy creatures and to all comes unprevented unimplor 'd unsought happie for man so coming he her aide can never seek once dead in sins and lost attonement for himself or offering meet indebted and undon hath none to bring behold mee then mee for him life for life i offer on mee let thine anger fall account mee man i for his sake will leave thy bosom and this glorie next to thee freely put off and for him lastly dye well pleas 'd on me let death wreck all his rage under his gloomie power i shall not long lie vanquisht thou hast givn me to possess life in my self for ever by thee i live though now to death i yield and am his due all that of me can die yet that debt paid thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave his prey nor suffer my unspotted soule for ever with corruption there to dwell but i shall rise victorious and subdue my vanquisher spoild of his vanted spoile death his deaths wound shall then receive and stoop inglorious of his mortall sting disarm 'd i through the ample air in triumph high shall lead hell captive maugre hell and show the powers of darkness bound thou at the sight pleas 'd out of heaven shalt look down and smile while by thee rais

with him raise his brethren ransomd with his own dear life so heav'nly love shall outdoo hellish hate giving to death and dying to redeeme so dearly to redeem what hellish hate so easily destroy 'd and still destroyes in those who when they may accept not grace nor shalt thou by descending to assume mans nature less'n or degrade thine owne because thou hast though thron 'd in highest bliss equal

the wall of heav'n though distant farr som small reflection gaines of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud here walk 'd the fiend at large in spacious field as when a vultur on imaus bred whose snowie ridge the roving tartar bounds dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs of ganges or hydaspes

transitorie and vain when sin with vanity had filld the works of men both all things vain and all who in vain things built thir fond hopes of glorie or lasting fame or happiness in this or th other

upwhirld aloft fly o 're the backside of the world farr off into a limbo large and broad since calld the paradise of fools to few unknown long after now unpeopl 'd and untrod all this dark globe the fiend found as he pass 'd and long he wanderd till at last a gleame of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste his travell 'd steps farr distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high at top whereof but farr more rich appeerd the work as of a kingly palace gate with frontispice of diamond and gold imbellisht thick with sparkling orient gemmes the portal shon inimitable on earth by model or by shading pencil drawn the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw angels ascending and descending bands of guardians bright when he from esau fled to padan-aram in the field of luz dreaming by night under the open skie and waking cri 'd this is the gate of heav'n each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood there alwayes but drawn up to heav'n somtimes viewless and underneath a bright sea flow'd of jasper or of liquid pearle whereon who after came from earth sayling arriv 'd wafted by angels or flew o 're the lake rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds the stairs were then let down whether to dare the fiend by easie ascent or aggravate his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss direct against which op'nd from beneath just o 're the blissful seat of paradise a passage down to th earth a passage wide wider by farr then that of after-times over mount sion and though that were large over the promis 'd land to god so dear by which to visit oft those happy tribes on high behests his angels to and fro pass 'd frequent and his eye with choice regard from paneas the fount of jordans flood to beersaba where the holy land borders on aegypt and the arabian shoare so wide the op'ning seemd where bounds were set to darkness such as bound the ocean wave satan from hence now on the lower stair that scal 'd by steps of gold to heav'n gate looks down with wonder at the sudden view of all this world at once as when a scout through dark and desart wayes with peril gone all night at last by break of chearful dawne obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill which to his eye discovers unaware the goodly prospect of some forein land first-seen or some renown 'd metropolis with glistering spires and pinnacles adornd which now the rising sun guilds with his beams such wonder seis 'd though after heaven seen the spirit maligne but much more envy seis'd at sight of all this world beheld so faire round he surveys and well might where he stood so high above the circling canopie of nights extended shade from eastern point of libra to the fleecie starr that bears andromeda farr off atlantic seas beyond th horizon then from pole to pole he views in bredth and without longer pause down right into the worlds first region throws his flight precipitant and windes with ease through the pure marble air his oblique way amongst innumerable starrs that shon stars distant but nigh hand seemd other worlds or other worlds they seemd or happy iles like those hesperian gardens fam 'd of old fortunate fields and groves and flourie vales thrice happy iles but who dwelt happy there he stayd not to enquire above them all the golden sun in splendor likest heaven allur 'd his eye thither his course he bends through the calm firmament but up or downe by center or eccentric hard to tell or longitude where the great luminarie alooff the vulgar constellations thick that from his lordly eye keep distance due dispenses light from farr they as they move thir starry dance in numbers that compute days months years towards his all-chearing lamp turn swift thir various motions or are turnd by his magnetic beam that gently warms the univers and to each inward part with gentle penetration though unseen shoots invisible vertue even to the deep so wondrously was set his station bright there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps astronomer in the sun 's lucent orbe through his glaz 'd optic tube yet never saw the place he found beyond expression bright compar 'd with aught on earth medal or stone not all parts

they binde volatil hermes and call up unbound in various shapes old proteus from the sea draind through a limbec to his native forme what wonder then if fields and regions here breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run potable gold when with one vertuous touch th arch-chimic sun so farr from us remote produces with terrestrial humor mixt here in the dark so many precious things of colour glorious and effect so rare here matter new to gaze the devil met undazl 'd farr and wide his eye commands for sight no obstacle found here nor shade but all sun-shine as when his beams at noon culminate from th aequator as they now shot upward still direct whence no way round shadow from body opaque can fall and the aire no where so cleer sharp'nd his visual ray to objects distant farr whereby he soon saw within kenn a glorious angel stand the same whom john saw also in the sun his back was turnd but not his brightness hid of beaming sunnie raies a golden tiar circl 'd his head nor less his locks

direct his wandring flight to paradise the happie seat of man his journies end and our beginning woe but first he casts to change his proper shape which else might work him danger or delay and now a stripling cherube he appeers not of the prime yet such as in his face youth smil 'd celestial and to every limb sutable grace diffus 'd so well he feignd under a coronet his flowing haire in curles on either cheek plaid wings he wore of many a colourd plume sprinkl 'd with gold his habit fit for speed succinct and held before his decent steps a silver wand he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turnd admonisht by his ear and strait was known th arch-angel uriel one of the seav'n who in gods presence neerest to his throne stand ready at command and are his

supream decree like honour to obtain and as his eye to visit oft this new creation round unspeakable desire to see and know all these his wondrous works but chiefly man his chief delight and favour

seat or fixed seat hath none but all these shining orbes his choice to dwell that i may find him and with secret gaze or open admiration him behold on whom the great creator hath bestowd worlds and on whom hath all these graces powrd that both in him and all things as is meet the universal maker we may praise who justly hath drivn out his rebell foes to deepest hell and to repair that loss created this new happie race of men to serve him better wise are all his wayes so spake the false dissembler unperceivd for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisie the onely evil that walks invisible except to god alone by his permissive will through heav'n and earth and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps at wisdoms gate and to simplicitie resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill where no ill seems which now for once beguil'd uriel though regent of the sun and held the sharpest sighted spirit of all in heav'n who to the fraudulent impostor foule in his uprightness answer thus returnd fair angel thy desire which tends to know the works of god thereby to glorifie the great work-maister leads to no excess that reaches blame but rather merits praise the more it seems excess that led thee hither from thy empyreal mansion thus alone to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps contented with report hear onely in heav'n for wonderful indeed are all his works pleasant to know and worthiest to be all had in remembrance alwayes with delight but what created mind can comprehend thir number or the wisdom infinite that brought them forth but hid thir causes deep i saw when at his word the formless mass this worlds material mould came to a heap confusion heard his voice and wilde uproar stood rul 'd stood vast infinitude confin 'd till at his second bidding darkness fled light shon and order from disorder sprung swift to thir several quarters hasted then the cumbrous elements earth flood aire fire and this ethereal quintessence of heav'n flew upward spirited with various forms that rowld orbicular and turnd to starrs numberless as thou seest and how they move each had his place appointed each his course the rest in circuit walles this universe look downward on that globe whose hither side with light from hence though but reflected shines that place is earth the seat of man that light his day which else as th other hemisphere night would invade but there the neighbouring moon so call that opposite fair starr her aide timely interposes and her monthly round still ending still renewing through mid heav'n with borrowd light her countenance triform hence fills and empties to enlighten th earth and in her pale dominion checks the night that spot to which i point is paradise adams abode those loftie shades his bowre thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires thus said he turnd and satan bowing low as to superior spirits is wont in heaven where honour due and reverence none neglects took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath down from th ecliptic sped with hop 'd success throws his steep flight in many an aerie wheele nor staid till on niphates top he lights
o for that warning voice which he who saw th apocalyps heard cry in heaven aloud then when the dragon put to second rout came furious down to be reveng 'd on men wo to the inhabitants on earth that now while time was our first-parents had bin warnd the coming of thir secret foe and scap'd haply so scap 'd his mortal snare for now satan now first inflam 'd with rage came down the tempter ere th accuser of man-kind to wreck on innocent frail man his loss of that first battel and his flight to hell yet not rejoycing in his speed though bold far off and fearless nor with cause to boast begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth now rowling boiles in his tumultuous brest and like a devillish engine back recoiles upon himself horror and doubt distract his troubl 'd thoughts and from the bottom stirr the hell within him for within him hell he brings and round about him nor from hell one step no more then from himself can fly by change of place now conscience wakes despair that slumberd wakes the bitter memorie of what he was what is and what must be worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant his grievd look he fixes sad sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun which now sat high in his meridian towre then much revolving thus in sighs began o thou that with surpassing glory crownd look'st from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the starrs hide thir diminisht heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell how glorious once above thy spheare till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heav'n against heav'ns matchless king ah wherefore he deservd no such return from me whom he created what i was in that bright eminence and with his good upbraided none nor was his service hard what could be less then to afford him praise the easiest recompence and pay him thanks how due yet all his good prov 'd ill in me and wrought but malice lifted up so high i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher would set me highest and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude so burthensome still paying still to ow forgetful what from him i still receivd and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not but still pays at once indebted and dischargd what burden then o had his powerful destiny ordaind me some inferiour angel i had stood then happie no unbounded hope had rais'd ambition yet why not som other power as great might have aspir 'd and me though mean drawn to his part but other powers as great fell not but stand unshak'n from within or from without to all temptations arm 'd hadst thou the same free will and power to stand thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse but heav'ns free love dealt equally to all be then his love accurst since love or hate to me alike it deals eternal woe nay curs 'd be thou since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues me miserable which way shall i flie infinite wrauth and infinite despaire which way i flie is hell my self am hell and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatning to devour me opens wide to which the hell i suffer seems a heav'n o then at last relent is there no place left for repentance none for pardon left none left but by submission and that word disdain forbids me and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath whom i seduc'd with other promises and other vaunts then to submit boasting i could subdue th omnipotent ay me they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vaine under what torments inwardly i groane while they adore me on the throne of hell with diadem and scepter high advanc'd the lower still i fall onely supream in miserie such joy ambition findes but say i could repent and could obtaine by act of grace my former state how soon would higth recal high thoughts how soon unsay what feign 'd submission swore ease would recant vows made in pain as violent and void for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have peirc 'd so deep which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall so should i purchase deare short intermission bought with double smart this knows my punisher therefore as farr from granting hee as i from begging peace all hope excluded thus behold in stead of us out-cast exil 'd his new delight mankind created and for him this world so farwel hope and with hope farwel fear farwel remorse all good to me is lost evil be thou my good by thee at least divided empire with heav'ns king i hold by thee and more then half perhaps will reigne as man ere long and this new world shall know thus while he spake each passion dimm 'd his face thrice chang 'd with pale ire envie and despair which marrd his borrow 'd visage and betraid him counterfet if any eye beheld for heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule are ever cleer whereof hee soon aware each perturbation smooth 'd with outward calme artificer of fraud and was the first that practisd falshood under saintly shew deep malice to conceale couch't with revenge yet not anough had practisd to deceive uriel once warnd whose eye pursu 'd him down the way he went and on th assyrian mount saw him disfigur 'd more then could befall spirit of happie sort his gestures fierce he markd and mad demeanour then alone as he suppos 'd all unobserv 'd unseen so on he fares and to the border comes of eden where delicious paradise now nearer crowns with her enclosure green as with a rural mound the champain head of a steep wilderness whose hairie sides with thicket overgrown grottesque and wilde access deni 'd and over head up grew insuperable highth of loftiest shade cedar and pine and firr and branching palm a silvan scene and as the ranks ascend shade above shade a woodie theatre of stateliest view yet higher then thir tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung which to our general sire gave prospect large into his neather empire neighbouring round and higher then that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt on which the sun more glad impress 'd his beams then in fair evening cloud or humid bow when god hath showrd the earth so lovely seemd that lantskip and of pure now purer aire meets his approach and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy able to drive all sadness but despair now gentle gales fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes and whisper whence they stole those balmie spoiles as when to them who saile beyond the cape of hope and now are past mozambic off at sea north-east windes blow sabean odours from the spicie shoare of arabie the blest with such delay well pleas 'd they slack thir course and many a league chear 'd with the grateful smell old ocean smiles so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend who came thir bane though with them better pleas'd then asmodeus with the fishie fume that drove him though enamourd from the spouse of tobits son and with a vengeance sent from media post to aegypt there fast bound now to th ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journied on pensive and slow but further way found none so thick entwin 'd as one continu 'd brake the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext all path of man or beast that past that way one gate there only was and that look 'd east on th other side which when th arch-fellon saw due entrance he disdaind and in contempt at one slight bound high over leap 'd all bound of hill or highest wall and sheer within lights on his feet as when a prowling wolfe whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve in hurdl 'd cotes amid the field secure leaps o 're the fence with ease into the fould or as a thief bent to unhoord the cash of some rich burgher whose substantial dores cross-barrd and bolted fast fear no assault in at the window climbs or o 're the tiles so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe thence up he flew and on the tree of life the middle tree and highest there that grew sat like a cormorant yet not true life thereby regaind but sat devising death to them who liv 'd nor on the vertue thought of that life-giving plant but only us'd for prospect what well us 'd had bin the pledge of immortality so little knows any but god alone to value right the good before him but perverts best things to worst abuse or to thir meanest use beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense expos'd in narrow room natures whole wealth yea more a heav'n on earth for blissful paradise of god the garden was by him in the east of eden planted eden stretchd her line from auran eastward to the royal towrs of great seleucia built by grecian kings or where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soile his farr more pleasant garden god ordaind out of the fertil ground he caus 'd to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste and all amid them stood the tree of life high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. southward through eden went a river large nor chang 'd his course but through the shaggie hill pass 'd underneath ingulft for god had thrown that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd upon the rapid current which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill waterd the garden thence united fell down the steep glade and met the neather flood which from his darksom passage now appeers and now divided into four main streams runs divers wandring many a famous realme and country whereof here needs no account but rather to tell how if art could tell how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold with mazie error under pendant shades ran nectar visiting each plant and fed flours worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots but nature boon powrd forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field and where the unpierc't shade lmbround the noontide bowrs thus was this place a happy rural seat of various view groves whose rich trees wept odorous gumms and balme others whose fruit burnisht with golden rinde

faire field of enna where proserpin gathering flours her self a fairer floure by gloomie dis was gatherd which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes and th inspir'd castalian spring might with this paradise of eden strive nor that nyseian ile girt with the river triton where old cham whom gentiles ammon call and lybian jove hid amalthea

clustring but not beneath his shoulders broad shee as a vail down to the slender waste her unadorned golden tresses wore dissheveld but in wanton ringlets wav'd as the vine curles her tendrils which impli'd subjection but requir 'd with gentle sway and by her yielded by him best receivd yielded with coy submission modest pride and sweet reluctant amorous delay nor those mysterious parts were then

they sat them down and after no more toil of thir sweet gardning labour then suffic'd to recommend coole zephyr and made ease more easie wholsom thirst and appetite more grateful to thir supper fruits they fell nectarine fruits which the compliant boughes yielded them side-long as they sat recline on the soft downie bank damaskt with flours the savourie pulp they chew and in the rinde still as they

who wrongd and should i at your harmless innocence melt as i doe yet public reason just honour and empire with revenge enlarg 'd by conquering this new world compels me now to do what else though

that rais 'd us from the dust and plac't us here in all this happiness who at his hand have nothing merited nor can performe aught whereof hee hath need hee who requires from us no other service then to keep this one this easie charge of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various not to taste that onely tree of knowledge planted by the tree of life so neer grows death to life what ere death is som dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowst god hath pronounc't it death to taste that tree the only sign of our obedience left among so many signes of power and rule conferrd upon us and dominion giv'n over all other creatures that possess earth aire and sea then let us not think hard one easie prohibition who enjoy free leave so large to all things else and choice unlimited of manifold delights but let us ever praise him and extoll his bountie following our delightful task to prune these growing plants and tend these flours which were it toilsom yet with thee were sweet to whom thus eve repli 'd o thou for whom and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh and without whom am to no end my guide and head what thou hast said is just and right for wee to him indeed all praises owe and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy so farr the happier lot enjoying thee praeeminent by so much odds while thou like consort to thy self canst no where find that day i oft

sound of waters issu 'd from a cave and spread into a liquid plain then stood unmov'd pure as th expanse of heav'n i thither went with unexperienc't thought and laid me downe on the green bank to look into the cleer smooth lake that to me seemd another skie as i bent down to look just opposite a shape within the watry gleam appeerd bending to look on me i started back it started back but pleas 'd i soon returnd pleas 'd it returnd as soon with answering looks of sympathie and love there i had fixt mine eyes till now and pin 'd with vain desire had not a voice thus warnd me what thou seest what

shall enjoy inseparablie thine to him shalt beare multitudes like thy self and thence be call'd mother of human race what could i doe but follow strait invisibly thus led till i espi 'd thee fair indeed and tall under a platan yet methought less faire less winning soft less amiablie milde then that smooth watry image back i turnd thou following cryd'st aloud return faire eve whom fli'st thou

this eevning from the sun 's decline arriv'd who tells of som infernal spirit seen hitherward bent who could have thought escap'd the barrs of hell on errand bad no doubt such where ye find seise fast and hither bring so saying on he led his radiant files daz'ling the moon these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought him there they found squat like a toad close at the eare of eve assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancie and with them forge illusions as he list phantasms and dreams or if inspiring venom he might taint th animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise at least distemperd discontented thoughts vaine hopes vaine aimes inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendring pride him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touch 'd lightly for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns of force to its own likeness up he starts discoverd and surpriz 'd as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid fit for the tun som magazin to store against a rumord warr the smuttie graine with sudden blaze diffus 'd inflames the aire so started up in his own shape the fiend back stept those two faire angels half amaz'd so sudden to behold the grieslie king yet thus unmovd with fear accost him soon which of those rebell spirits adjudg 'd to hell com'st thou escap 'd thy prison and transform 'd why satst thou like an enemie in waite here watching at the head of these that sleep know ye not then said satan fill 'd with scorn know ye not mee ye knew me once no mate

vain to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn think not revolted spirit thy shape the same or undiminisht brightness to be known as when thou stoodst in heav'n upright and pure that glorie then when thou no more wast good departed from thee and thou resembl'st now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule but come for thou be sure shalt give account to him who sent us whose charge is to keep this place inviolable and these from harm so spake the cherube and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beautie added grace invincible abasht the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is and saw vertue in her shape how lovly saw and pin'd his loss but chiefly to find here observd his lustre visibly impar 'd yet seemd undaunted if i must contend said he best with the best the sender not the sent or all at once more glorie will be wonn or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold will save us trial what the least can doe single against thee wicked and thence weak the fiend repli 'd not overcome with rage but like a proud steed reind went hautie on chaumping his iron curb to strive or flie he held it vain awe from above had quelld his heart not else dismai 'd now drew they nigh the western point where those half-rounding guard just met and closing stood in squadron joind awaiting next command to whom thir chief gabriel from the front thus calld aloud o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way and now by glimps discerne ithuriel and zephon through the shade and with them comes a third of regal port but faded splendor wan who by his gate and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell not likely to part hence without contest stand firm for in his look defiance lours he scarce had ended when those two approachd and brief related whom they brought where found how busied in what form and posture coucht to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescrib'd to thy transgressions and disturbd the charge of others who approve not to transgress by thy example but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place imploi 'd it seems to violate sleep and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow gabriel thou hadst in heav'n th esteem of wise and such i held thee but this question askt puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain who would not finding way break loose from hell though thither doomd thou wouldst thy self no doubt and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain where thou mightest hope to change torment with ease and soonest recompence dole with delight which in this place i sought to thee no reason who knowst only good but evil hast not tri 'd and wilt object his will who bound us let him surer barr his iron gates if he intends our stay in that dark durance thus much what was askt the rest is true they found me where they say but that implies not violence or harme thus he in scorn.the warlike angel mov 'd disdainfully half smiling thus repli 'd o loss of one in heav'n to judge of wise since satan fell whom follie overthrew and now returns him from his prison scap't gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicenc't from his bounds in hell prescrib 'd so wise he judges it to fly from pain however and to scape his punishment so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth which thou incurr'st by flying meet thy flight seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell which taught thee yet no better that no pain can equal anger infinite provok't but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose is pain to them less pain less to be fled or thou then they less hardie to endure courageous chief the first in flight from pain had'st thou alledg'd to thy deserted host this cause of flight thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern not that i less endure or shrink from pain insulting angel well thou knowst i stood thy fiercest when in battel to thy aide thy blasting volied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear but still thy words at random as before argue thy inexperience what behooves from hard assaies and ill successes past a faithful leader not to hazard all through wayes of danger by himself untri 'd i therefore i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss and spie this new created world whereof in hell fame is not silent here in hope to find better abode and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth or in mid aire though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against whose easier business were to serve thir lord high up in heav'n with songs to hymne his throne and practis 'd distances to cringe not fight to whom the warriour angel soon repli 'd to say and strait unsay pretending first wise to flie pain professing next the spie argues no leader but a lyar trac't satan and couldst thou faithful add o name o sacred name of faithfulness profan 'd faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew armie of fiends fit body to fit head was this your discipline and faith ingag 'd your military obedience to dissolve allegeance to th acknowldg 'd power supream and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem patron of liberty who more then thou once fawn 'd and cring 'd and servilly ador'd heav'ns awful monarch wherefore but in hope to dispossess him and thy self to reigne but mark what i arreede thee now avant flie thither whence thou fledst if from this houre within these hallowd limits thou appeer back to th infernal pit i drag thee chaind and seale thee so as henceforth not to scorne the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd so threatn 'd hee but satan to no threats gave heed but waxing more in rage repli 'd then when i am thy captive talk of chaines proud limitarie cherube but ere then farr heavier load thy self expect to feel from my prevailing arme though heavens king ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers us 'd to the yoak draw'st his triumphant wheels in progress through the rode of heav'n star-pav 'd while thus he spake th angelic squadron bright turnd fierie red sharpning in mooned hornes thir phalanx and began to hemm him round with ported spears as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears which way the wind swayes them the careful plowman doubting stands least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves prove chaff on th other side satan allarm'd collecting all his might dilated stood like teneriff or atlas unremov 'd his stature reacht the skie and on his crest sat horror plum 'd nor wanted in his graspe what seemd both spear and shield now dreadful deeds might have ensu 'd nor onely paradise in this commotion but the starrie cope of heav'n perhaps or all the elements at least had gon to rack disturbd and torne with violence of this conflict had not soon th eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heav'n his golden scales yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe wherein all things created first he weighd the pendulous round earth with ballanc't aire in counterpoise now ponders all events battels and realms in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight the latter quick up flew and kickt the beam which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend satan i know thy strength and thou knowst mine neither our own but giv'n what follie then to boast what arms can doe since thine no more then heav'n permits nor mine though doubld now to trample thee as mire for proof look up and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weigh 'd and shown how light how weak if thou resist the fiend lookt up and knew his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled murmuring and with him fled the shades of night
all night the dreadless angel unpursu'd through heav'ns wide champain held his way till morn wak't by the circling hours with rosie hand unbarr 'd the gates of light there is a cave within the mount of god fast by his throne where light and darkness in perpetual round lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heav'n grateful vicissitude like day and night light issues forth and at the other dore obsequious darkness enters till her houre to veile the heav'n though darkness there might well seem twilight here and now went forth the morn such as in highest heav'n arrayd in gold empyreal from before her vanisht night shot through with orient beams when all the plain coverd with thick embatteld squadrons bright chariots and flaming armes and fierie steeds reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view warr he perceav 'd warr in procinct and found already known what he for news had thought to have reported gladly then he mixt among those friendly powers who him receav'd with joy and acclamations loud that one that of so many myriads fall'n yet one returnd not lost on to the sacred hill they led him high applauded and present before the seat supream from whence a voice from midst a golden cloud thus milde was heard servant of god well done well hast thou fought the better fight who single hast maintaind against revolted multitudes the cause of truth in word mightier then they in armes and for the testimonie of truth hast born universal reproach far worse to beare then violence for this was all thy care to stand approv 'd in sight of god though worlds judg 'd thee perverse the easier conquest now remains thee aided by this host of friends back on thy foes more glorious to return then scornd thou didst depart and to subdue by force who reason for thir law refuse right reason for thir law and for thir king messiah who by right of merit reigns go michael of celestial armies prince and thou in military prowess next gabriel lead forth to battel these my sons invincible lead forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions rang 'd for fight equal in number to that godless crew rebellious them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault and to the brow of heav'n pursuing drive them out from god and bliss into thir place of punishment the gulf of tartarus which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receave thir fall so spake the sovran voice and clouds began to darken all the hill and smoak to rowl in duskie wreathes reluctant flames the signe of wrauth awak't nor with less dread the loud ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow at which command the powers militant that stood for heav'n in mighty quadrate joyn '' d of union irresistible mov 'd on in silence thir bright legions to the sound of instrumental harmonie that breath'd heroic ardor to advent'rous deeds under thir god-like leaders in the cause of god and his messiah on they move indissolubly firm nor obvious hill nor streit'ning vale nor wood nor stream divides thir perfet ranks for high above the ground thir march was and the passive air upbore thir nimble tread as when the total kind of birds in orderly array on wing came summond over eden to receive thir names of thee so over many a tract of heav'n they march 'd and many a province wide tenfold the length of this terrene at last farr in th horizon to the north appeer'd from skirt to skirt a fierie region stretcht in battailous aspect and neerer view bristl 'd with upright beams innumerable of rigid spears and helmets throng 'd and shields various with boastful argument portraid the banded powers of satan hasting on with furious expedition for they weend that self same day by fight or by surprize to win the mount of god and on his throne to set the envier of his state the proud aspirer but thir thoughts prov 'd fond and vain in the mid way though strange to us it seemd at first that angel should with angel warr and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet so oft in festivals of joy and love unanimous as sons of one great sire hymning th eternal father but the shout of battel now began and rushing sound of onset ended soon each milder thought high in the midst exalted as a god th apostat in his sun-bright chariot sate idol of majestie divine enclos'd with flaming cherubim and golden shields then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now 'twixt host and host but narrow space was left a dreadful intervall and front to front presented stood in terrible array of hideous length before the cloudie van on the rough edge of battel ere it joyn d satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't came towring armd in adamant and gold abdiel that sight endur 'd not where he stood among the mightiest bent on highest deeds and thus his own undaunted heart explores o heav'n that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain where faith and realtie remain not wherfore should not strength and might there fail where vertue fails or weakest prove where boldest though to sight unconquerable his puissance trusting in th almightie 's aide i mean to try whose reason i have tri'd unsound and false nor is it aught but just that he who in debate of truth hath won should win in arms in both disputes alike victor though brutish that contest and foule when reason hath to deal with force yet so most reason is that reason overcome so pondering and from his armed peers forth stepping opposite half way he met his daring foe at this prevention more incens't and thus securely him defi 'd proud art thou met thy hope was to have reacht the highth of thy aspiring unoppos 'd the throne of god unguarded and his side abandond at the terror of thy power or potent tongue fool not to think how vain against th omnipotent to rise in arms who out of smallest things could without end have rais 'd incessant armies to defeat thy folly or with solitarie hand reaching beyond all limit at one blow unaided could have finisht thee and whelmd thy legions under darkness but thou seest all are not of thy train there be who faith prefer and pietie to god though then to thee not visible when i alone seemd in thy world erroneous to dissent from all my sect thou seest now learn too late how few somtimes may know when thousands err whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answerd ill for thee but in wisht houre of my revenge first sought for thou returnst from flight seditious angel to receave thy merited reward the first assay of this right hand provok't since first that tongue inspir 'd with contradiction durst oppose a third part of the gods in synod met thir deities to assert who while they feel vigour divine within them can allow omnipotence to none but well thou comst before thy fellows ambitious to win from me som plume that thy success may show destruction to the rest this pause between unanswerd least thou boast to let thee know at first i thought that libertie and heav'n to heav'nly soules had bin all one but now i see that most through sloth had rather serve ministring spirits traind up in feast and song such hast thou arm 'd the ministrelsie of heav'n servilitie with freedom to contend as both thir deeds compar 'd this day shall prove to whom in brief thus abdiel stern repli 'd apostat still thou errst nor end wilt find of erring from the path of truth remote unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name of servitude to serve whom god ordains or nature god and nature bid the same when he who rules is worthiest and excells them whom he governs this is servitude to serve th unwise or him who hath rebelld against his worthier as thine now serve thee thy self not free but to thy self enthrall 'd yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid reign thou in hell thy kingdom let mee serve in heav'n god ever blest and his divine behests obey worthiest to be obey 'd yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while from mee returnd as erst thou saidst from flight this greeting on thy impious crest receive so saying a noble stroke he lifted high which hung not but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan that no sight nor motion of swift thought less could his shield such ruin intercept ten paces huge he back recoild the tenth on bended knee his massie spear upstaid as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong had push't a mountain from his seat half sunk with all his pines amazement seis'd the rebel thrones but greater rage to see thus foil 'd thir mightiest ours joy filld and shout presage of victorie and fierce desire of battel whereat michael bid sound th arch-angel trumpet through the vast of heaven it

all earth had to her center shook what wonder when millions of fierce encountring angels fought on either side the least of whom could weild these elements and arm him with the force of all thir regions how much more of power armie against armie numberless to raise dreadful combustion warring and disturb though not destroy thir happie native seat had not th eternal king omnipotent from his strong hold of heav'n high over-rul'd and limited thir might though numberd such as each divided legion might have seemd a numerous host in strength each armed hand a legion led in fight yet leader

faithful now prov 'd false but think not here to trouble holy rest heav'n casts thee out from all her confines heav'n the seat of bliss brooks not the works of violence and warr hence then and evil go

sunnie plaines and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these creatures that livd and movd and walk 'd or flew birds on the branches warbling all things smil 'd with fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow 'd my self i then perus 'd and limb by limb survey 'd and sometimes went and sometimes ran with supple joints and lively vigour led but who i was or where or from what cause knew not to speak i tri 'd and forthwith spake my tongue obey 'd and readily could name what e 're i saw thou sun said i faire light and thou enlight'nd earth so fresh and gay ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plaines and ye that live and move fair creatures tell tell if ye saw how came i thus how here not of my self by some great maker then in goodness and in power praeeminent tell me how may i know him how adore from whom i have that thus i move and live and feel that i am happier then i know while thus i call 'd and stray 'd i knew not whither from where i first drew aire and first beheld this happie light when answer none return 'd on a green shadie bank profuse of flours pensive i sate me down there gentle sleep first found me and with soft oppression seis'd my droused sense untroubl 'd though i thought i then was passing to my former state insensible and forthwith to dissolve when suddenly stood at my head a dream whose inward apparition gently mov'd my fancy to believe i yet had being and livd one came methought of shape divine and said thy mansion wants thee adam rise first man of men innumerable ordain'd first father call 'd by thee i come thy guide to the garden of bliss thy seat prepar 'd so saying by the hand he took me rais 'd and over fields and waters as in aire smooth sliding without step last led me up a woodie mountain whose high top was plaine a circuit wide enclos 'd with goodliest trees planted with walks and bowers that what i saw of earth before scarce pleasant seemd each tree load'n with fairest fruit that hung to the eye tempting stirr 'd in me sudden appetite to pluck and eate whereat i wak 'd and found before mine eyes all real as the dream had lively shadowd here had new begun my wandring had not hee who was my guide up hither from among the trees appeer'd presence divine rejoycing but with aw in adoration at his feet i fell submiss he rear 'd me and whom thou soughtst i am said mildely author of all this thou seest above or round about thee or beneath this paradise i give thee count it thine to till and keep and of the fruit to eate of every tree that in the garden growes eate freely with glad heart fear here no dearth but of the tree whose operation brings knowledg of good and ill which i have set the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith amid the garden by the tree of life remember what i warne thee shun to taste and shun the bitter consequence for know the day thou eat'st thereof my sole command transgrest inevitably thou shalt dye from that day mortal and this happie state shalt loose expell 'd from hence into a world of woe and sorrow sternly he pronounc'd the rigid interdiction which resounds yet dreadful in mine eare though in my choice not to incur but soon his cleer aspect return 'd and gracious purpose thus renew 'd not onely these fair bounds but all the earth to thee and to thy race i give as lords possess it and all things that therein live or live in sea or aire beast fish and fowle in signe whereof each bird and beast behold after thir kindes i bring them to receave from thee thir names and pay thee fealtie with low subjection understand the same of fish within thir watry residence not hither summond since they can not change thir element to draw the thinner aire as thus he spake each bird and beast behold approaching two and two these cowring low with blandishment each bird stoop 'd on his wing i nam 'd them as they pass 'd and understood thir nature with such knowledg god endu'd my sudden apprehension but in these i found not what me thought i wanted still and to the heav'nly vision thus presum 'd o by what name for thou above all these above mankinde or aught then mankinde higher surpassest farr my naming how may i adore thee author of this universe and all this good to man for whose well being so amply and with hands so liberal thou hast provided all things but with mee i see not who partakes in solitude what happiness who can enjoy alone or all enjoying what contentment find thus i presumptuous and the vision bright as with a smile more bright'nd thus repli 'd what call'st thou solitude is not the earth with various living creatures and the aire replenisht and all these at thy command to come and play before thee know'st thou not thir language and thir wayes they also know and reason not contemptibly with these find pastime and beare rule thy realm is large so spake the universal lord and seem'd so ordering i with leave of speech implor 'd and humble deprecation thus repli 'd let not my words offend thee heav'nly power my maker be propitious while i speak hast thou not made me here thy substitute and these inferiour farr beneath me set among unequals what societie can sort what harmonie or true delight which must be mutual in proportion due giv'n and receiv 'd but in disparitie the one intense the other still remiss can not well suite with either but soon prove tedious alike of fellowship i speak such as i seek fit to participate all rational delight wherein the brute can not be human consort they rejoyce each with thir kinde lion with lioness so fitly them in pairs thou hast combin 'd much less can bird with beast or fish with fowle so well converse nor with the ox the ape wors then can man with beast and least of all whereto th almighty answer 'd not displeas 'd a nice and suttle happiness i see thou to thy self proposest in the choice of thy associates adam and wilt taste no pleasure though in pleasure solitarie what thinkst thou then of mee and this my state seem i to thee sufficiently possest of happiness or not who am alone from all eternitie for none i know second to me or like equal much less how have i then with whom to hold converse save with the creatures which i made and those to me inferiour infinite descents beneath what other creatures are to thee he ceas 'd i lowly answer 'd to attaine the highth and depth of thy eternal wayes all human thoughts come short supream of things thou in thy self art perfet and in thee is no deficience found not so is man but in degree the cause of his desire by conversation with his like to help or solace his defects no need that thou

nature as in aide and clos 'd mine eyes mine eyes he clos 'd but op'n left the cell of fancie my internal sight by which abstract as in a transe methought i saw though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape still glorious before whom awake i stood who stooping op'nd my left side and took from thence a rib with cordial spirits warme and life-blood streaming fresh wide was the wound but suddenly with flesh fill 'd up and heal 'd the rib he formd and fashond with his hands under his forming hands a creature grew manlike but different sex so lovly faire that what seemd fair in all the world seemd now mean or in her summd up in her containd and in her looks which from that time infus'd sweetness into my heart unfelt before and into all things from her aire inspir'd the spirit of love and amorous delight shee disappeerd and left me dark i wak'd to find her or for ever to deplore her loss and other pleasures all abjure when out of hope behold her not farr off such as i saw her in my dream adornd with what all earth or heaven could bestow to make her amiable on she came led by her heav'nly maker though unseen and guided by his voice nor uninformd of nuptial sanctitie and marriage rites grace was in all her steps heav'n in her eye in every gesture dignitie and love i overjoyd could not forbear aloud this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfill'd thy words creator bounteous and

told thee all my state and brought my storie to the sum of earthly bliss which i enjoy and must confess to find in all things else delight indeed but such as us 'd or not works in the mind no change nor vehement desire these delicacies i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flours walks and the melodie of birds but here farr otherwise transported i behold transported touch here passion first i felt commotion strange in all enjoyments else superiour and unmov 'd here onely weake against the charm of beauties powerful glance or nature faild in mee and left some part not proof enough

looking at the lion behind the plate glass i wasn ’ t sure what i was looking at a lion ok but he seemed to come apart not literally i mean but i couldn ’ t see him whole mane teeth the slung belly pumping as he panted and began to roar his balls sheathed in fur swaying a little his tail ’ s tuft jerking in an arc like an old-time pump handle rusted in midair somebody or something i read once said that when jesus had his vision of what his father god would do to him that jesus could only see pieces of a cross pieces of a body appearing through flashes of sun as if the body in his vision was hands looking for feet a head for a torso everything come unmagnetized from the soul the lion caught me in his stare not at or through me but fixated on the great chain of being that jesus couldn ’ t see and that a zebra might gallop in — black and white stripes marking longitudes of this world turning to meat bloody meat — this vision of an inmate that jesus ’ s father helped to orchestrate by making a cageless cage with glass instead of bars — though the lion didn ’ t seem to care he was roaring for his keepers to bring him food so everything ’ s what it should be if you ’ re a lion nor did the sea lion seem concerned about having gone a little crazy barking incessantly so i could see the plush hot pink insides of its throat though like the lion through the glass there ’ s this distortion my reflection i ’ m looking through that makes me float above the zoo and now this silence at closing time pours like a waterfall in different zones of silences that pouring through my head surround roaring barking human muttering — is any of that what being sounds like or is it just animal gasping like what jesus must have heard from the thieves hanging beside him one damned one saved what was in his heart when his vision clarified and he saw it was a hand he recognized that the nail was driving through

today the date palms were pruned the branches taken before the fruit ripened before sweetness littered the sidewalks the man who sawed them worked alone a crane lifting him to the yellowed fronds beside his truck he stood tall american a pensive pioneer the top of each palm looked like the back of a man 's head after a close-crop haircut the neck cooled to a stubbly remembrance of hair or was like a cat after being spayed startled by a strange newness pacing familiar rooms darting confused and you had you wished to console are greeted with a barren gaze the rubble of bark and fronds reminded me of iraq not the ruined bridges or the surrendering soldiers hands begging food but the 16 million date palms one per capita lining the seams of the tigris and euphrates a reminder of my own libya and its 10 million date palms and the years of easy wealth that brought them neglect except in huun a magical city where they stuffed dates with almonds and sent them as far as tanta and oum dourman from huun this story a boy stands by a palm imploring his uncle to toss him a fistful of dates flustered by the boy 's monotonous cries the uncle loses his feet and as he falls to his death cries down `` here nephew i 'm coming down with the dates '' so that 's what we got from huun almond stuffed wonders and proverbial last words there was another reminder a tale of the prophet muhammad living for months on water and coarse wheat bread his wives protesting the austere measures of his faith muhammad who praised honey and had a professed love for cantaloupes and who once declared `` the best meat is that which lines the bones '' found in dates the solution he required to his arab followers and to his wives the fruit was `` three skies above luxury '' and as indispensable as water and air i once had this dream of whitman i found him under one of the palms on sherman way gazing admiring though he had seen palms by the gulf of mexico he had never tasted a date so we drove to a supermarket and he who had been thoughtful even dignified until then began to sign and moan at the taste of `` araby's sugared dust clouds '' when we walked the aisles he insisted on pushing the cart the frozen foods did not surprise him since his granny buried potatoes in the cold dirt of her homestead still i had to explain tofu plastic tacos and the foods labeled free he ran his hands caressing the waxed floor '' smooth as a girl 's wrist '' he exclaimed the bright fluorescent lights reminded hirn of the opera and walt sang a gravelly tune the children sitting in carts reached for him their hands were lorca 's butterflies on his beard at the cashier he filled pockets with candy and was shocked by the headlines of our news honda toyota saturn oldsmobile— in the parking lot the names waltzed on his tongue at the fast food stand he ate heartily the burger 's slipperiness amused him and at his clumsiness we both had a laugh then the talk grew quiet the table stretching like the expanse of time dividing us i felt he no longer wanted company having begun to understand our world despite his old resentment of blacks and now my neighbors the foreign-born hispanics and their engines roaring through balboa and saticoy and the koreans karoake— the baseline 's muffled thuds voices doused in canadian mist and the off-key pleadings to the lover who never comes— america remained to him luminous-industrial-fuming- sublime and as he wished beyond others' adjectives beyond what anyone could have conceived mumbling a farewell whitman stood to leave and with this my dream ended whitman wishing to depart and i holding on to his wrists all day i wanted to hold his wide wrists if you drive west of alexandria your path will run through alamain barani and matrouh then egypt will end with a town on a steep hill called sallum if you go through the two checkpoints libya will unfold its dry pastures for you on the sallum hill there is a hotel where people stay to await relatives crossing the border or to hear word if it is safe to return across the road a tired bluegreen tea house sits like a bruise permanently on the verge of fading from the prairies skin you will also see the money changers— all teenage boys with their right hands they will wave thick wads of money at your windshield and with their left they will jostle to give you the best rate the last time i stayed in sallum few cars came from either direction and among the boys fights flared with curses and stones hurled at brows when the boys rabble grew loud a man lazily stepped out of the tea house to call them bastards and sons of whores this went on for hours until the sun settled in the middle of the sky the boys taking shelter under a torn canvas shed and the man to the tea house 's dusty cool then just when all movement and noise seemed to surrender to the september wind and heat four of the boys broke for a run racing—money still clutched in their hands— to a young date palm in the distance pressing shoulders and backs against it they shook the palm until the season's first fruit began to rain the other boys joined them and soon the tea house emptied of the men slouching inside those were my brothers who cowered beneath the date palm to gather handfuls of fruit rubbing each date clean on their sleeves chewing softly to savor the taste as though it were a good omen and rising to resume their lives on their faces the smiles of those who once were blessed
my mother forgets to feed her animals because it 's only fair she rushes to them when she hears hoarse roosters crowing and billy goats butting over a last straw this month the moon becomes a princess the stars fan her jupiter pours cups of wine mars sings melancholy mawals bearded men holding prayer beads and yellow booklets stare at her and point aching fingers at her waist in our house we break a fast with dates from huun and glasses of buttermilk then on to bowls of lamb soup flavored with mint trays of stuffed grape leaves spiced fava beans drenched in olive oil and lemon juice and that is only the beginning the spirits of johnny walker and gin hide in the trunks of white peugeots in the nightclubs of my city waiters serve only non-alcoholic beer and belly dancers cover themselves father of sixteen children our neighbor visits bringing two kilos of baklava he washes them down with a dozen demitasses of sweet sage tea before dawn he runs to one of his two wives both named salma and loves her hurriedly his hands barely touching a breast
my mother is obsessed with reading about jesus these days i see books piled by her bed most of them borrowed from my library novels handbooks sectarian polemics writers coming to blows sometimes when i ’ m passing by her room she calls on me to step between them and resolve their disputes a little while ago i came to the aid of a historian called kamal salibi whose forehead had been split open by a catholic stone what a diligent reader she is when she ’ s searching for jesus this woman i never failed to disappoint i was not martyred in the first intifada nor in the second nor in the third and just between you and me i won ’ t be martyred in any future intifada either nor will i be killed by some booby-trapped stork as she reads her orthodox imagination crucifies me with every page ... while i do nothing but supply it with more books and nails
one example of hierophany is the apparition of angels this is a new word i overheard this morning it occurs when the divine realm manifests — or the word intrudes — into our quotidian realm the natural one an untidy fleshliness of the ordinary or the sacred and profane is another way to say this i asked whether it is a hernia and the answer was no a herniated condition is viscera on viscera — a disc organs the skin or nerves besides such a comparison would be profane a figure of speech already exists i said in a hieratic silence of cursive writing long ago dead not long ago those two phrases dwelled in separate worlds i dare you to use the word hernia in a poem said a friend so i not only used the word i invited god into language or god existed before language while god is also the word remember all theophanies are forms of hierophany however the converse is not always true — not all hierophanies are theophanies — or god visible in our world
when i can not believe the brown herds still move across green fields into the tufty hills and i was born higher where i could watch them as a bird might when even memory seems imagined what can i bring to prayer a pair of knees the great faith that built a stair to heaven as now my memory tries to climb a hill becomes an old stone building a deaf priest whose hand is in the pockets of his parish who longs to buy a bell he 'll never hear the water in the font is cold i trace a circle on my brow and not a cross
this season for us the jews— a season of candles one more on the seven-branched candlestick for the seven days of the week but let it be seven in the sense of luck in dice seven of the stars in the constellations orion aldebaran in the sky lively over jerusalem let the fuel last the besieged such as we are to nourish us let the oil continue for heat for illumination flame crouching in the lamp the glass smoky december upon us the light not fail the air has been mild for days— the 7 rings through my life despite the 8 of this week— bushes in the doorway of 7 charles where i lived 51 crackle with dryness are bare still that house with the lucky number brought me luck misluck both like the other that added to 7 out of 4 3 that seven underlying the eight of this week the 8 just over the 7 just under a third of the years with stefan i praise them both today— the lasting oil in the seven-branched candlestick absence of all fear—the smallest drop of fuel enough to leap from new york 1973
'i believe it would go ill with many of us if we were faced with a strong temptation and i suspect that with many of us it does go ill.' —ivy compton burnett he set out on the innocent exodus he went at easter in a lengthening dawn and he did not count the days he was young with the wooden comb his mother made him he parted his hair in the middle his beard was slow he was fair still he glowed like a source of light there were so many priests about there was too much singing he did not like god the father who came from rome with his tattered son and the incomprehensible bird easter for him was other kinds of rebirth but from the trees and streams the uplands and valleys he knew the native spirits dislodged crowding the shore to cross over like no longer immortal souls lined up awaiting the ferry and the disgruntled boatman they did not intend to fade out to the sound of bells and choiring they would find a new woodland or water for haunt untroubled by candles and books and the tedious meaningless latin without farewell before daybreak he left home he pushed past the visible almost crowd on the shore divine shapes scents their sorrowful voices and silences he murmured out of respect and they let him pass through goodbye he declared to them and to his country first he crossed the small sea in a leather coracle pointing the blunt prow at what looked like mainland the sea was glassy he paddled with his palms at landfall made fire and warmed them conjuring spirits of a new place they gathered around to gaze at his lovely body he abandoned his boat and clambered up the rocks he climbed a hill a ridge and then a mountain it was a protracted joy that crossing away from the small sea looking back ireland got littler then it and the smooth water were lost to view and never again did he see what had been home hear its lilt or receive news of his many brothers who bred and banked their fields who fished and hunted and made a tribe a village and a nation the uplands were lush and full of fauna the grass deep humming and everywhere were gods their tears their wounds and resurrections spring smattered the glades flecked and mottled with blossom the wheeling birds shouted their emphatic prayer and deer that enormous stag with a broken antler wolves and wild cats too a bear he saw red pheasants and rooting through an oak wood a tusky boar ... he walked in amazement he did not count the days reading the symbols and cheerful local gods skipped and tumbled before him showing the way across the very backbone of that mainland it was not england yet it was wilderness he wrapped his feet in grass and leaves in strips of leather he wore a leathern kilt and a stiff hide waistcoat fragrant with wear and weather as he went along he runed was merry it was almost like rhyming he climbed jet black mountains veined with silver falls washed face and hands in the frenzied spray of those tarns made the noises of a man free now of christendom in the uncharted unmarred wilderness his sweet voice gracing the ears of insects beasts and wild fowl and the ears of the local spirits orpheus or as adam 's must have done when he told the animals who they were in the first sunrise of the world before eve had been carved out of his rejoicing to correct and contradict him and the tall fruit tree stood safe in his obedience when at evening god himself not his bloodied son walked out in starlight and kissed his creature and lay with him in the dark it was not he began to know an innocent exodus it was the long route to exile the way that hermits took to white martyrdom alone with their god for ever he was not like them wild-hearted spirits of place coaxed his credulous footsteps past the equinox on the eastern shore of what was becoming england he saw far off kernels of cities squat towers spires rough roads north and south wagons groaning with stone and into meagre harbours boats and barges hugging the coast bore produce in and away that world was not for him with its crosses and crossroads he saw steep islands dark in a bigger sea no man mark on them no smoke no stone quarry no furrows or shepherds in their thin woods no traps it was summer now he did not count the days he sat on the summit of the last hill and looked east wondering where on that island he would build his round stone dwelling and give his mortal days to local grace the gods of leaf and stone with his soul configured to love like a hearth his heart on fire but unconsumed because such promiscuous heat amazes and makes not cinders but rapture and language his dwelling would be a beacon a land-star radiant to a lowering ocean unbroken beyond the islands as far as the eye shading his eyes he went on his way he crossed the bad sands not knowing they were bad between two tides two islands walking ankle deep knee then up to the waist the paps until only his upturned face floated on the water the mouth crying out joyful spells eyes fixed on the sun the flaxen hair fanned out like rays of a lesser sphere he could not swim but there was no need a sea god hovered ahead sandals firm on the wave emerging step by step he was new it was autumn his homelessness this island these tilting rocks he chose for his dwelling a high place with a view of nothing but east the rows of waves impatient to crash on the boulders where the storms might climb and burst over his reflections and the fowls of the air become familiars he set to work carting stones gods gathered nearby harkening making crowns of nettle spears of bone a cup from a gourd and a dish each day his dwelling grew higher like a hive for bees a dome a cranium one day it was the solstice a final stone closed the fontanel the votary moved in he gathered the crowns and spears the cup and dish and laid out the new table for his guests would the gods sit down beside at his first supper he looked for them he called out praising their names they had all gone off somewhere there was nowhere to go the tide was full and even the deep route hither had gone under waves the mainland had vanished in fog he sat alone at his table he sat alone the gods who had brought him were gone he started counting day one was the day when things began to go he watched his shadow every morning lengthening over the water over the sand and stones and being washed and parched like a piece of laundry until it was white as a nightshirt spread to dry on a gorse bush fluttering a little an empty sleeve saying go on go back go on go back the way waves do the way the tides do also or simply wind blows and the tide says nothing at all how clean the stones and the sand the breaking waves how clean the moonlight the sunlight and his lovely throat young and in love—is it still young and in love — with the spirits his voice pure as a bird 's but he 's counting the days are shortening his voice is growing darker surely they listen out and watch their votary there on the verge of the cliff in his careful dance like a gull whose wings are reliance like a guillemot so he chanted he praised and danced and it was the end of autumn for the first time cold he telt the bones in his flesh above him north with terror he saw the lights and it was a human shadow that towered in them a man on a cross a man with a cross inside him instead of a skeleton the cross was still and shimmered as if it held its breath so as to observe him he was trembling he saw the ghostly limbs behind the bright-dim curtain those long wired veins through which pulse flickered and the wine flowed the chest breathed with almost no sound at all this figure had nothing to do with the gods who brought him tugged at his heart took their leave when most he needed this looked like the son of the god he had sought to elude now a giant surveying a world and a singular man abandoned by everything he 'd served but nonetheless dancing and shivering above the scrum of waves cities had grown on the mainland meanwhile monks and priors grew fat there were nuns and teachers the farmsteads prospered the places he 'd passed through had roads now stone towers and walls where he 'd chanted to wilderness out of a pagan heart to the east there is nothing.the sleet blows in it is so cold now winter hardening the days are counted and are counting down after laud and joy the radiance fading winter is here and bidding becomes of the body the rings of light of fire the rings of starlight the votary tries his tongue to find what he means he tries to speak with what has been refined he has no words at all the feet that led the hands that rested on his head arrested him are nowhere he was grown old and unremarkable and now he knows desire he knows desire as he has never known any passion in his person before he desires a voice a touch from his precipice soon like a gannet he 's to dive or like a stone winter has come indeed and the stars he 's wasted wasted no devil arrives to offer long life and kingdoms to touch his brow to kiss him on the lips no gods return with prayer mats and chains of flowers with brands and blankets with warm thick drinks with lamplight with meat or fruit with a breathing loaf or a lamb in the coldest night someone does cover him and when he wakes he finds a fire alive in the hearth his table laid with biscuit and in the gourd a mouthful of pure water he is old his matted beard dark filthy he has praised presence and absence and set his glow fading on the island 's seaward face when he starts dying that night in the flickering of his chamber the vikings steer five ships packed with warriors around the end of his island using his glimmer as lighthouse and marker reaching their intended haven had he survived that night even afar he 'd have felt the heat of the conflagration smelled apocalypse as the pagans returned and the little gods came with them clapping their hands and rejoicing and rushed to the woods to be with their trees and streams and hills and valleys as the church spires collapsed the monks and priors and priests fuel for bonfires and until the vikings withdrew they were safe divine again though the shuddering lights disclosed the tall cross and the watcher smoke in his heart the island 's dark the darker now for his dying unmarked and unremarked but someone covers his face is winding in coarse scented cloth the extinguished body having tidied the wild hair parted it in the centre and washed at last the limbs that longed to be touched someone rolls them to the cliff edge lets them go east
jesus i want my sins back my prattle pride and private prices — climbing clinching clocking — i might loan you a few for the evening so you don ’ t show up at your own crucifixion naked of all purpose but for god ’ s sake don ’ t spill any redemption on them they ’ re my signature looks body by envy make up wardrobe provided by avarice lord if you take away my inordinate cravings what the hell ’ s left do you know how much i paid for my best rages i want them all back if they ’ re so to die for else shred my palms wash my face with spit let the whip unlace my flesh and free the naked blood let me be tumbled to immortality with the stew of flood debris that is my life
today my brother brought over a piece of the ark wrapped in a white plastic grocery bag he set the bag on my dining table unknotted it peeled it away revealing a foot-long fracture of wood he took a step back and gestured toward it with his arms and open palms — it ’ s the ark he said you mean noah ’ s ark i asked what other ark is there he answered read the inscription he told me it tells what ’ s going to happen at the end what end i wanted to know he laughed what do you mean “ what end ” the end end then he lifted it out the plastic bag rattled his fingers were silkened by pipe blisters he held the jagged piece of wood so gently i had forgotten my brother could be gentle he set it on the table the way people on television set things when they ’ re afraid those things might blow-up or go-off — he set it right next to my empty coffee cup it was no ark — it was the broken end of a picture frame with a floral design carved into its surface he put his head in his hands — i shouldn ’ t show you this — god why did i show her this it ’ s ancient — o god this is so old fine i gave in where did you get it the girl he said o the girl what girl i asked you ’ ll wish you never knew he told me i watched him drag his wrecked fingers over the chipped flower-work of the wood — you should read it but o you can ’ t take it — no matter how many books you ’ ve read he was wrong i could take the ark i could even take his marvelously fucked fingers the way they almost glittered it was the animals — the animals i could not take — they came up the walkway into my house cracked the doorframe with their hooves and hips marched past me into my kitchen into my brother tails snaking across my feet before disappearing like retracting vacuum cords into the hollows of my brother ’ s clavicles tusks scraping the walls reaching out for him — wildebeests pigs the oryxes with their black matching horns javelinas jaguars pumas raptors the ocelots with their mathematical faces so many kinds of goat so many kinds of creature i wanted to follow them to get to the bottom of it but my brother stopped me — this is serious he said you have to understand it can save you so i sat down with my brother wrecked open like that and two-by-two the fantastical beasts parading him i sat as the water fell against my ankles built itself up around me filled my coffee cup before floating it away from the table my brother — teeming with shadows — a hull of bones lit only by tooth and tusk lifting his ark high in the air
he was calling in the bulls from the street they came like a dark river — a blur of chest and hoof — everything moving under splinter — hooked their horns through the walls light hummed the holes like yellow jackets my mouth was a nest torn empty then he was at the table then in the pig ’ s jaws — he was not hungry he was stop he was bad apple he was choking so i punched my fists against his stomach mars flew out and broke open or bloomed — how many small red eyes shut in that husk he said look look and they did he said lift up your shirt and i did he slid his fork beneath my ribs — yes he sang a jesus side wound it wouldn ’ t stop bleeding he reached inside and turned on the lamp — i never knew i was also a lamp — until the light fell out of me dripped down my thigh flew up in me caught in my throat like a canary canaries really means dogs he said he put on his shoes you started this with your mouth he pointed where are you going i asked to ride the ferris wheel he answered and climbed inside me like a window
the source i thought was arctic the good platonic up the pole was soaked film an electric elevation onto a fishy platform and waves on two sides greenly welcoming the sunwater poured on holy atheism it was light that powered out my ego or my heart before ending with a letter
this world is not conclusion a species stands beyond invisible as music but positive as sound it beckons and it baffles philosophy dont know and through a riddle at the last sagacity must go to guess it puzzles scholars to gain it men have borne contempt of generations and crucifixion shown faith slips and laughs and rallies blushes if any see plucks at a twig of evidence and asks a vane the way much gesture from the pulpit strong hallelujahs roll narcotics can not still the tooth that nibbles at the soul
you ca n't fake it you know when i fail to achieve the expected palm the becoming- comatose bullfrog legs collapsing as they may and chuck it we used to say high as you can let it fly stone-like to the skylight in the low dome of fog—another requirement of the game a foggy day and a bullfrog and you vincent the old code goes back and forth between us as we take our turns childhood pals engaged by the game we once called kamikaze—now a nameless ceremony nameless not because a boy 's play calcifies in a man 's conviction not because despite our promise you 've become a mid-rank fighter pilot and i a minor poet and not because it 's too unpleasant to name what brings to hand that astonished muscle only to leave it later sprawled on the current the perfect toss sends the critter shattering for an instant beyond fog into the invisible disappearance is success once you said `` my insides tickle whenever it happens '' and so i know you 've been tickled five times and i three that 's the score the score matters little the name is gone because we 're from here and being native can not visit how it is that an urge to which we tend tends to us— how we are cruel inscrutable indefensible yet holy how we send up bodies of praise from our right hand only to gather eventual elegies— flesh stunned still as words—in our left once again the center of the heavens is earth we 've thrown as high as we can for as long as we can remember only to await some return a revelation plummet explosive splash so it is that two grown men may stand again in stillness awaiting word friends who glimpse for seconds at a time earth as it is in heaven ankle-deep in rowan creek with eyes uplifted reflecting the fog to the fog itself
1. i was born on a tuesday in april i did n't cry not because i was stunned i was n't even mad i was the lucky egg trained for gratitude inside the belly for nine months straight two workers welded bunk beds at the end of the delivery room one on top of the other my universe might have been the white lime ceiling or the embodiment of einstein 's bent space in the aluminum springs of the bed above that curved toward the center neither cold nor warm `` it was a clear day '' my mother told me it 's hard to believe there were a few romantic evenings when i was conceived a buzz in the retina and red-laced magma decadently peeling off a silver candlestick infants cries and milk fever turned to salt from the stench of bleach— abrasive unequivocal with a piece of cloth wrapped on the end of a stick the janitor casually extends the negative space of the black-and-white tiled floor like a mouth of broken teeth a baleen of darkness sieving out new human destinies 2 1968. at the dock ships arriving from the east dumped punctured rice bags mice and the delirium of the cultural revolution a couple of men in uniform cleared out the church in the middle of the night the locals saw the priest in the yard wearing only his underwear shivering from the cold their eyes disillusioned questioned one another '' was n't he the one who pardoned our sins '' icons burned in front of their eyes icons and the holy scriptures witnesses stepped farther back as if looking at love letters nobody dared to claim crosses were plucked from graves and from each mouth spilled irreversible promises mounds of dirt the rains would smooth down sooner or later children dragged church bells by the tongue why didn ’ t they think of this before overnight the dome was demolished instantly revealing a myriad of nameless stars that chased the crowd like flies on a dead horse and what could replace sunday mass now women brought cauldrons into the yard men filled up their pipes smoke rose into the air against gravity 's pull nails in worn out shoes exposed stigmata that bled in the wrong places— a new code of sanctification of man by man 3 `` read `` —i was told who said that angel gabriel or my first-grade teacher who had dark roots underneath her bleached curls language arrived fragmentary split in syllables spasmodic like code in times of war `` continue where your classmate left off '' a long sentence tied us to one another without connotation as if inside an idiom someone would get to read the noun another the verb a third one a pronoun i always got the exclamation mark at the end— a mere grimace a small curse a tall cast-iron stove below the portrait of the dictator puffing smoke from its temples enough heat for everyone on the blackboard leftover diphthongs from yesterday or the day before rubbed against one another like kittens after dusk i looked for another language outside the window my eyes glued to a constellation they call these types `` dreamers '' my discovery possibly a journey into the past toward a galaxy already dead nonexistent the kind of news that needs millions of years to reach me `` read `` —the angel shook me for a third time her finger pointing to an arbitrary word a million light years apart from its object it did n't matter who was first negative space sketched my onomatopoeic profile of body and shadow in an accidental encounter 4. language is erosive it makes us recluses a wind through the canyons carving our paleontological eras for everyone to read under the revised testament of my skin bellows a gold-cast bull an alluring object a need for attention then comes the unleavened bread and a last supper which remarkably is repeated several times between ice ages lower yet sodom i recognize it from the stench of sulfur i hold my nose freud would have done the same and then cain a crow taught him how to bury his own brother and at the bottom adam ’ s gentlemanlike sin under which scientists discover earlier epochs of famine between unidentified layers wanderings in the sand the search for a new prophet i try to understand my people their language is plain some words were actually never uttered like pages stuck together in a book fresh off the press and long after it sits on a shelf this too lives inside me within insidious bubbles of air negative spaces where i can find little historical rest but also where utter ruin may originate 5. little left of the snow three days ago its blanket ripped away exposing dog shit and the bruises of routine negative space gives form to the woods and to the mad woman—a silhouette of the goddess athena wearing a pair of flip flops an owl on her shoulder it ’ s minus zero the factory ’ s gate gnashes its teeth behind the back of the last worker blowing noses shivering mucus a virus circulates through the workplace secretly intimately touching one person after another a current of sensuality it softens the tone but nothing unites them more than their frailty the one-sizes-fits-all shoes you must grow accustomed to by filling the extra space with cotton or curling your ill-fitting toes 6. in halil ’ s yard rules were sacrilege his eight children entertained themselves by carrying famine on their shoulders recalling st. bartholomew ’ s flayed skin starving filthy hazel-eyed— three qualities that unexpectedly coalesce in the bright light strung together like sneezes one ’ s famine was another ’ s consolation “ look at them it ’ s a sin for us to complain they ’ re even worse off than us ” but even halil found his own consolation in the old woman zyra “ barren and paralyzed ” the root origin of despair this was our highlands landscape hierarchical where each family would make out a different expiration date on the roof below their own schadenfreude was the only river that could turn mills but if this hierarchy shifted and our roof gave signs of ruin my mother would plant tulips in the garden white tulips our false image a scarecrow to keep predators away 7. nearly nothing was mentioned in the letters he sent from prison just two lines on top of the page “ i am well ” and “ if you can please send me a pair of woolen socks. ” from them i learned to read between the lines negative spaces the unsaid gestures insomnia that like a hat ’ s shadow fails to shade your chin and ears and in the photographs ’ white background acrophobia adds to the color of their eyes blue green gray and ultimately chesnut brown as earthward we lower our gaze i learned to read the empty spaces the dead left behind—a pair of folded glasses after the reading ’ s done and discourse commences or the musical chairs game called `` love '' where there are less empty seats than people if you don ’ t want to be the last one standing you must predict when the music will stop who though has really succeeded perhaps a little practice can be useful in this case i don ’ t mean squatting jumping stretching but listening to the same music every day from the start the same miserable vinyl record so that you ’ ll recognize its cracks before it recognizes yours 8. midnight snoring meaningless sounds that stain the side of the wall that belongs to no one so where are we what dimension who foots the bill at a time like this without lambs or sinners when even angels record nothing the street ’ s clearly visible under the neon 24-hour-service sign above the funeral home there was a music shop next to it that closed down a few months ago the shop shared a wall with the funeral home shared the same water pipes and the same gate to heaven but the coffins won the wide-shouldered coffins that narrow down in the shape of a mummy not a human wood of the highest quality swears the owner and pure silk inside pleated like a stomach that can digest even a bulldozer when asleep we 're simply five limbs starfish if you cut one limb it will grow back even a single limb could recreate us from the beginning a single hope negative space is always fertile 9. no one knows if it was simply a matter of mixed or some other reason why i used to see what i was n't supposed to see— the ending of things it wasn ’ t a mystical gift but like a blood clot in the darkness of a vein i held on to reason as it circulated from the bottom up and not the other way around as we were told i used to start from the edges and with my left hand or a croupier ’ s stick gather the balls and dice from the corners and then watch the bettors as neither a winner nor a loser there 's nothing sillier than watching a film in reverse where after the climax the protagonists are replaced by circumstances and circumstances replaced by minor characters their tongues plastered behind a single fatal smirk life and my short lunar calendar slipped away like carbon paper sending off as much light as necessary skipping the details the contrast and sharp colors lunar time is short until the actual end there are years enough the negative spaces what to do with them when the verb has already been uttered a conclusive sentence with latin syntax or more than that didactic
for all the pain passed down the genes or latent in the very grain of being for the lordless mornings the smear of spirit words intuit and inter for all the nightfall neverness inking into me even now my prayer is that a mind blurred by anxiety or despair might find here a trace of peace

she was my sunday school teacher when i was just seven and eight he was the newly hired pastor an albino alarming sight with his transparent eyelashes and mouse-pink skin that looked like it might hurt whenever she caressed his arm since eva was her name to my child ’ s mind it made great sense that she should fall in love with him he was adán before the fall and afterward her invert twin and she eva was blonde as well though more robust like liv ullmann i loved her honey hair her full lips her green eyes a nameless sin not that i worried all that much— the church was presbyterian in sunday school her way to teach us kids to pray was to comment on all the beauty we could touch or see in our environment my hand was always in the air to volunteer my sentiment since other kids considered prayer a chore the floor was usually mine my list of joys left out her hair but blessed the red hibiscus seen through the windows while others bowed their heads her heart i schemed to win with purple prose on meringue clouds —for who was adán anyway i thought but nada spelled backward while hers reversed called out ave ave the lyric of a bird born and airborne on the same day but it was night when i saw her outside the church for the last time yellow light mosquitoes summer i shaped a barking dog a fine but disembodied pair of wings with my hands she spoke in hushed tones to my parents the next day i would find myself up north in a strange house without my tongue and almost blind there was so much to see this caused cuba my past to be eclipsed in time but eva stayed a loss ave i learned meant also this farewell i haven ’ t seen her since
and then i began my habit of walking at night to get rid of the strings witherings the lord revealed to me that i am full of birds turned smoke and hookèd strings i say to the lord lord take a string i have named it mesas ringed with beeswax wicks footsteps sowing up my stairs tambourines in trees then a tedious gruesome miracle unfolds for the lord takes the string and what attends it walking over a grate there is the sound of the grate margarita mondays mean exactly that i say how could i eat i ate and how can i sleep i shake the lord says look at the branches how they braid over graves and the lord says look at the handimart a bright ordered box they have their grief the people there now the tableaus mass color now the tableaus fall down i say wet pavement keep on holding me up wet pavement hold me up now the fetishes crumble now the meteors cup the lord says i meant of it a blessing and i say i made of it a curse the lord says sound of roots sound of shoots sound of asphalt sound of cars i say i am walked into deeps here are the jewelthreads and throbbings that i need to leave the lord says chomp and be chewed alleluia sever and stitch alleluia exceedingly the lord says bar barr barr i say snowfield snowfield piñon roasting chaparall the lord says is what you want the terrible free and i say to the lord lord speak and the lord says sound of earth in orbit its muffled its four-chambered beat
tonight we shall read from my personal book of lamentations sit shiva in a room lit with those overly perfumed candles as thick as the aluminum bat i used just last week to flip away the possum carcass i 'd found collapsed against the house forensics tells us the backyard is panama before quinine an ecosystem unto itself civil war of mongoose snake and cat the cause of the possum 's death was obvious this near-biblical dryness that lasted the summer this morning i found a carapace a palmetto bug in my shower dead in his search for water he got flushed a viking funeral minutes later i heard about rocky 48 complications from a ruptured aortic aneurysm who went the same week as john 47 though by less violent means i 'd never introduced either to my family and now i am covering the mirrors pictures from a decade ago exist without context the bars in them closed marriages shattered on the pebbly coast of installment debt bands broken up by midnight arguments dead men ca n't recall forgive us our trespasses yes but also this literalism let us frame the only surviving picture of the three of us in a rectangle of thorns before we take communion out in the street i will let those candles burn burn burn burn burn to the wick barracuda then tell you how i would have laid down my life for either of those two men and i have nothing to offer now they have done that for me

the young man hardly more than a boy who fired the shot had looked at him with an air not of anger but of concentration as if he were surveying a road or feeding a length of wood into a saw it had to be done just so the bullet passed through his upper chest below the collar bone the pain was not what he might have feared strangely exhilarated he staggered out of the pasture and into a grove of trees he pressed and pressed the wound trying to stanch the blood but he could only press what he could reach and he could not reach his back where the bullet had exited he lay on the earth smelling the leaves and mosses musty and damp and cool after the blaze of open afternoon how good the earth smelled as it had when he was a boy hiding from his father who was intent of strapping him for doing his chores late one time too many a cowbird razzed from a rail fence it is n't mockery he thought no malice in it just a noise stray bullets nicked the oaks overhead leaves and splinters fell someone near him groaned but it was his own voice he heard his fingers and feet tingled the roof of his mouth and the bridge of his nose he became dry dry and thought of christ who said i thirst his man-smell the smell of his hair and skin his sweat the salt smell of his cock and the little ferny hairs that two women had known left him and a sharp almost sweet smell began to rise from his open mouth in the warm shade of the oaks a streak of sun climbed the rough trunk of a tree but he did not see it with his open eye
when she was seven my grandmother suffered from fever and swollen glands the doctors believed her tonsils were inflamed that she needed surgery instead she went to a curandera the curandera divined that a jealous relative had cast a curse on her and now her language of kindness was bound to her throat the unspoken swelling her glands as a child my grandmother spoke to santitos with a voice like a chestnut ruddy and warm seeds dropping from her mouth the santitos would take her words into themselves her voice growing within them like grapevines during the tonsillitis when the words no longer fell like seeds from her lips the santito 's vineyards of accent and voice grew vapid dry as a parched mouth they went to her tongue and asked why silence imprisoned the words of the child why lumps were present under her chin why tears drew channels down her cheeks i asked my grandmother how her tongue replied after touching my cheek she told me she had a dream that night she was within her lungs and she rose like breath through the moist of her throat she remembered her tonsils swinging before her like fleshy apples then a hand taking them into a fist harvesting their sound she told me her throat opened in two spots like insect eyes and the names of her children came flying through her wounds like peacocks patting my thigh she said `` that is why the name of your mother is maria because she is a prayer a song of praise to the holy mother '' she told me this then showed me two scars on her throat—tiny scars like two eyelids stitched closed
lean and sane in the last hour of a long fast or fiercer discipline he could touch dust into a sudden surge of limbs and speak leaves in the night air above him inhabit quiet so wholly he heard roots inch into the unfeeling earth rings increasing inside of that tree without moving hardly breathing he could call out of the long darkness walls around him a house whose each room he knew its hoard of silences solitudes doors opening onto the wide fields through which he moved breathing deeply unbewildered by the dead with their hands of wind their faces of cloud stilled and gifted in the last hour before the first light in the dark place of his own making he could feel rocks relax alive beside him gather from a moon-raveled river the pearl curves and blue fluency of a girl his hands once knew he could let her go he let it all go desire and grief and raw need going out of him moment by moment into the mild immaculate night love by love into a last passion of pure attention nerves readiness ... light carved out of the darkness a muscled trunk each clenched limb and the difficult tips of a plain mesquite taking shape over the hard ground where they found him his eyes wide and his whole body hungering upward as if he could hear and bear the bird singing unseen deep in those leaves
this inwardness this ice this wide boreal whiteness into which he 's come with a crawling sort of care for the sky 's severer blue the edge on the air trusting his own lightness and the feel as feeling goes this discipline this glaze this cold opacity of days begins to crack no marks not one scar no sign of where they are these weaknesses rumoring through growing loud if he stays louder if he turns back nothing to do but move nowhere to go but on to creep and breathe and learn a blue beyond belief an air too sharp to pause this distance this burn this element of flaws that winces as it gives nothing to do but live nowhere to be but gone

like a cloud above a ravine is the hell you already know that sublime work of the imagination by dante alighieri but the rain that falls from that cloud is not made up of human souls it rains and the rain funnels down into the something-other-than-human sewer look how a chinese writing brush ends in a cone of rigid horsehair loaded with ink the cone will flex will leave a wet trench in the rice paper it will leave an attractive trench and the daylight sucked into the ink will give it a reflective “ shine dot ” — like looking into an animal ’ s eye which of you has looked into the looking-up eyes of a hair-trigger fox a backyard fox or a campsite coyote daoist unintelligible brave which of you knows how not to part the pebble on the beach from its colors the songbird from its social network the fruit from its multifaceted peel oh that sugary piece of phosphorus in its form-fitted velvet casing that unappreciated egyptian sarcophagus meant to be opened from the inside and each seed-bearing fruit has an atmosphere each has its several moons has tides subject to gravity changing weather lunar eclipses but should an arrow suddenly snatch the waiting pomegranate out of your hand if it snatches the cap off your head recall its circuit has only begun for the arrow of the luckless archer returns to the middle of his or her back there between athletic shoulder blades is a diploma tube full of arrows is a diploma tube full of arrows and so it is time for graduation the genie ’ s gone back to his bottle the devils to their fallow hells and the chinese writing brush and the cloud above the ravine wherein the charged particles have sorted themselves along their up-and-down axis and the looking-up eyes of the fox and the sarcophagus and the campsite are irreducible to a system are each of them floating over a void truly “ all hells and hierarchies are works of the imagination. ” and equally “ it is not the part of the daoist sage to conjure meaningless hells ”
if i had enough cages to keep all the birds i ’ ve collected over the years then i would have to open a shop because there ’ s only so much room in a two-bedroom walk-up for 48 birds not to mention the dancing bears and the frogs or the different varieties of fish the one species of flea and i almost forgot the proud dogs and the lone mule the profane one who entered my life to curse at scribes and pharisees and maybe he ’ d let the mouse i found forever dying at the end of a poem ride on his back like a whiskered christ and if not maybe my yeti could do it when he ’ s not downtown working security at the store or teaching the parrots how to say brotherhood in grunt and how to comb out the tangles and mud from his hair whose sweat reminds me of that bearded collector of beasts with the ark who would have no doubt understood how i feel that prophet of change under whose spell i want to confess that i ’ m a christian of the old testament that my grandfather hung all his goats upside down their throats over a bucket and slapped their chests like that other nature boy who strutted around the ring like a peacock with his feathered hair that stayed immaculate even on the nights he lost to our hero wahoo mcdaniel who never played the heel he who hailed from the lost tribes of oklahoma who made us want to be chiefs so much we wore pigeon feathers and circled each other inside a green square of water hose until someone finally rang the bell that was never there and we sprung toward each other like animals in love or at war

on the platter set out in the center of the matyó-embroidered tablecloth was the syringe and around it was silence my father gazed at my mother and she back at him slowly faltering he began to speak i was seized by an unusual shuddering i recall that he used the word fate and that if i consented to the injected dose we could all fall asleep we would stay together for all time and evade the uncertainty in mortifying desperation a fifteen-year-old ’ s desire to live cried out in me “ no ” to which my father stated “ if you want to live then we too must keep on living because we can ’ t leave you by yourself. ” my father was the village doctor i grew up with no siblings my mother ’ s sister lived next door with her husband and two children nelly and gyurika in the evenings i prayed “ merciful lord of mine my eyes have closed but thine yet still are open father mine watch over me as i recline. ” then this “ in one god i believe in one homeland i believe in the eternal divine truth i believe in hungary ’ s re- surrection i believe amen. ” gyuri could not study in pest he went to brünn later not even there then the family sent him to toulouse my mind could not comprehend then one of uncle vilmos ’ s servants murdered him with six ax-blows he screamed crazed into the courtyard “ that ’ s what the stinking jew deserved ” i found him his head smashed open i ran to my father who didn ’ t even believe it and one after the other the horrors came nelly lived in újvidék with her husband uncle ernő was in the middle of shaving when hungarians broke into the flat they were looking for the family the nanny quickly threw a quilt onto six-month-old tomika they didn ’ t notice him peterke was out with nelly uncle ernő was executed on the ice of the danube nelly did not recover she knitted pullovers each more beautiful than the next so as not to feel the pain she went to pest to learn a trade so she could support her children that ’ s how it was when nineteen-forty-four came on march 15 one of my teachers said “ you remain seated ” while the class sang the anthem “ and be quiet. ” on the day of the nineteenth the germans invaded from then on it was obligatory to wear the star through the intervention of the medical officer and the lord lieutenant my father could have stayed out i had to move to the ghetto with my mother my father said “ the family should stay together. ” all up and down our street they stood to bid farewell father acknowledged them but already he was just waiting for the end he had aged by decades then the injection the one i already spoke of turned up on the table with the matyó embroidery we sat in the evening underneath the open sky before being loaded onto the freight cars the doctor from the next village drank mercury chloride with his wife despite my father ’ s stomach lavage they succumbed by the morning there were eighty of us in the wagon an expectant mother gave birth on the way but with no water my father could not save them there were those who went mad in the freight cars my father taught me always to say “ ich will arbeiten. ” on the seventh of july the train stopped father read the plaque auschwitz-birkenau and said “ we are lost ” megaphones blared “ leave your packages in the wagons they will be brought to you later special vehicles are coming for the sick and the elderly just remain sitting ” they repeated “ everything will be fine men exit the wagon to the left women to the right. ” as farewell my papa said “ always be my clever my obedient my good little girl ... ” that is how we parted for eternity tomika and peterke were squeezing my hand tightly but my mother said “ don ’ t you want to sit down we can walk come ... ” we moved forward in a column of five rows the bulbs of the searchlights blinded us in the eyes a german officer legs wide apart he stood there somewhere far away sent us to the right had to get undressed in a room then they sent us into another and the iron door slammed bolted shut screaming i pounded on it again and again we truly were lost as last i understood ... turning around the others already shaved bald i didn ’ t recognize anyone they stood there like sheep upon their skin the writing of gooseflesh
we ’ re all pagans and shamans and clap your hands now we won ’ t stop the beat we believe in divine healing and we hate to see that evening sun go down we know when the sight of our women dressed in white each ritual night is touching hypnotizes the animals blush and split for us as revival as revealed to themselves these are triumphant women even sister fame hiding out in the alley turning tricks and singing verses from the undid scripture is touching thank you jesus thank you jesus that you jesus baby is that you she mutters up high between rocks and lace — his eagerness — it was all night long sometimes he ’ d interrupt a recording session to tell us about his early motown days or expand on his views of heaven and hell one time he was saying how important it was to love one ’ s father do you love yours i asked him why don ’ t you tell him why don ’ t you tell your father he said i will if you do you go first
they staunched the wound with a stone they drew blue venom from his blood until there was none when his veins ran true his face remained lifeless and all the mothers of the village wept and pounded their chests until the sky had little choice but to grant their supplications god made the boy breathe again god breathes life into us it is said only once but this case was an exception god drew back in a giant gust and blew life into the boy and like a stranded fish he shuddered oceanless it was true the boy lived he lived for a very long time the toxins were an oil slick contaminated cleaned but just as soon as the women kissed redness back into his cheeks the boy began to die again he continued to die for the rest of his life the dying took place slowly sweetly the dying took a very long time
like nights we knelt on the dirt floor of a dugout leaned our heads back eyes twitching gone and popped nitrous canisters into the communion shapes of our mouths slipped inside where everything seemed to be falling snow ice the time split between chasing flies through a darkened park and sprawling in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss we drifted in like dew more like pollen on our skins and beneath a want for touch a kiss a return like nothing back then to break an arm latching on to the bumper of an impala or settling back as the car took us as far as the salted bridge before letting the ride go with a mitten caught behind the chrome waving from the other side of the river like this you said sliding a needle watching dope plunge the body 's rush and tow until you felt something like an angel hovering above but it was only pigeon feathers deviling the air those friends are gone some dead dying locked up or jailed in themselves and when i see some kids running in the heat of a taillight swirling behind them i remember we wanted only to quiet our bodies their unnatural hum a vague pull inward some thin furrows gliding over the snow

all day long i 've been hidden enmeshed locked in the shadow of the holy mountain my body covered with shame i 'd hoped there would be a dog barking furiously unable to go forward unable to go back at least with the sound of a dog barking i 'd attain something something instead of a dog barking there was silence then the sound of a drum beaten loud fast by a young nun into this temple come none of the grand sounds none of the great thoughts in the cabbage field heads all the same size are profiles of young novice nuns the priestesses sitting in unmun temple young faces like dew like hoarfrost

agion oros 2006 the air is cool and is right thick with birdsong as our bleary crew files out of a sudden disinterred from three sepulchral hours of prayer into an amber brilliance rioting outside the cemetery chapel with bits of greek and english intermixed the monks invite us to the portico for coffee παξιμάδια a shot of cold ρακί as i say the air is cool animate and lit and in such light the road already beckons so i skip the coffee pound the shot and pocket two hard biscuits and yes the way is broad at first but narrows soon enough παξιμάδια — pahximáthia — greek biscotti ρακί — rahkeé — greek grappa
a psalm of isaak amid uncommon darkness o being both far distant and most near o lover embracing all unlovable o tender tether binding us together and binding yea and tenderly your person to ourselves being both beyond our ken and kindred one whose dire energies invest such clay as ours with patent animation o secret one secreting life anew into our every tissue moribund afresh unto our stale and stalling craft grant in this obscurity a little light
the king asks “ tell me what is the highest meaning of the holiest truths ” the seer answers “ emptiness without holiness. ” the king is a restless seeker the seer is a ruler and thief i am seriously watching how trees are always missing some leaves they sweep the air looking for them nothing distracts them nothing where leaves are missing between the branches beautiful sun porches which disappear when the tree reaches them “ who are you ” the king asks “ it is not like that ” the seer says the seer leaves the king alone in his throne room and starts walking to china kicking up gravel hurrying to find the next king on the road between country houses he stops to listen to trees digging the air for crickets he wonders whether the king is mad now like the trees or dancing and recounting the story without an end
for a.b she said god he seems to be there when i call on him but calling has been difficult too painful and as she quieted to find another word i was delivered once more to my own long grappling with that very angel here — still here — at the base of the ancient ladder of ascent in foul dust languishing yet at the very bottom rung letting go my grip long before the blessing
at the altarpiece of saint teresa no need to be coy— you know what she ’ s doing and so did bernini when he found teresa in the full-throttle of her divine vision caught her at it carving this surrender so fluidly you expect the impossible for her tang to swell up ripe as seafoam from the gulf of her flushed and falling figure perhaps this is how god comes to us or should come to us all the bluntly and beautifully corporeal at prayers in the sunday school of pleasure why shouldn ’ t he come to us as he did to teresa a saint on her back— a girl tearing open the gift he gave her

as the storm-struck oak leaned closer to the house — the remaining six-story half of the tree listing toward the glass box of the kitchen like someone in the first tilt of stumbling — the other half crashed into the neighbors ’ yards a massive diagonal for which we had no visual cue save for an antler dropped by a constellation — as the ragged half leaned nearer the second storm of cloying snow began pulling on the shocked still-looming splitting and its branches dragged lower like ripped hems it was tripping over until they rustled on the roof under which i quickly made dinner each noise a threat from a body under which we so recently said thank goodness for our tree how it has accompanied us all these years thank goodness for its recitation of the seasons out our windows and over the little lot of our yard thank goodness for the birdsong and squirrel games which keep us from living alone and for its proffered shade the crack of the bat resounding through september when its dime-sized acorns land on the tin awning next door have mercy on us you the massively beautiful now ravaged and charged with destruction we did speak like that as if from a book of psalms because it took up the sky
i wear my heart on my sleeve or rather both sleeves since it 's usually broken sometimes when i join my hands to pray the jagged edges briefly touch like a plate that fell and cracked apart from being asked to hold too much
adam ate an apple it got stuck in his throat and they called him eve the progenitor the creator of all things the mother of strength and fortitude and sadness adam ate an apple choked on it so hard a rib popped out of his chest and they called it eve the progenitor the creator of all things the mother of strength and fortitude and sadness it takes the hacking of a body to make a woman adam hacking up a piece of his body it was just a piece of fruit they called me fruit once too they called me fruity before they called me flaming before they called me faggot before they called me woman i thought i would have to hack this body into pieces woman a name stuck in my throat right under the apple adam tried to eat choked on it for years waited for my ribs to pop out my chest to explode for my eve to be created from the fruit i couldn ’ t swallow they called me fruit once until they called me woman and then they just called me fruitless as if it took a womb to be progenitor creator mother of all things strength and fortitude and sadness they reckon god looked at the image of herself and called it adam they still don ’ t call me woman they still don ’ t birth me eve even though they cast me out my throat shrunken close with the fruit still stuck in it like adam before they called him eve and suddenly i am a stranger to eden i am a stranger to this body as if it hadn ’ t always been mine i reckon god looked at the image of herself and called it me but i don ’ t know if that was before or after the apple before or after adam choked which came first the progenitor or the mother the apple or the rib the strength or the sadness this body was god ’ s original creation but they called it sin they called it adam i reckon god looked at the image of herself and called adam eve after she choked on his name some fruit that bloomed in everyone else ’ s throat but she could never quite swallow the fall of man was an apple hacked up from a fruitless body a woman learning what evil was like a man forcing his name upon you the fall of man was a rib being torn from a chest and men calling that violence holy naming a woman based only on the body parts she ’ s made of the fall of man was the beginning of eve eve casting out adam ’ s name eve discovering who she was the progenitor the creator of all things the mother of strength and fortitude and sadness the fall of man was eve becoming a woman with or without eden ’ s approval and now every time someone tries to call her adam tries to force the apple of his name down her throat she laughs she swallows she looks at god herself and she smiles

you have lipstick on your collar i say to my father the priest that ’ s just the blood of christ my son he replies by and by the milky thigh of mary in my mind william blake ’ s eyes aligning in the snow a statue outside london simply called “ the heretic ” where birds sit and shit and live out their days in unconscious praise of that third space between language and the mute object as sunlight pours through the stained glass at the lincoln park zoo where i saw the lions pacing and you told me to always remember that the cage is for the protection of the captor
lotan baba a holy man from india rolled on his side for four thousand kilometers across the country in his quest for world peace and eternal salvation —reuters he started small fasting here and there days then weeks once he stood under a banyan tree for a full seven years sitting for nothing—not even to sleep it came to him in a dream you must roll on this earth spin your heart in rain desert dust at sunrise he ’ d stretch swab any cuts from the day before and lay prone on the road while his twelve men swept the ground in front of him with sisal brooms even monkeys stopped and stared at this man rolling through puddles past storefronts where children would throw him pieces of butter candy he ’ d try and catch in his mouth at each rotation his men swept and sang swept and sang of jasmine-throated angels and pineapple slices in kulfi cream he rolled and rolled sometimes in his dizzying spins he thought he heard god a whisper but still
it ’ s september i ’ ve moved into town into the attic of an old barn—a big open room i reach by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor the room is long and high with windows at each end a row of skylights that leak rain and shake and chatter in the northeast winds i sleep beneath the roof ’ s steep pitch my mattress flat on the boards looking up at the high ceiling where morning diffuses downward in grains of bright dust this was the old painter ’ s studio the light in those famous canvases is still here —he couldn ’ t carry it away with him— though his paintings took away everything else opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow i think of his violent loves the stories they still tell about him here but how quiet and alive his paintings were how they quiver with the life not yet realized the town is quiet in september sometimes i hear people talking in the street last night someone said they were going to wait for michael and a voice said that michael had gone home i walk the narrow path down to the marsh wind hard in the dunes rain as i ’ m returning cutting through twisting streets past gardens bent low with rain their colors a wash of gold i feel the air surround my body feel it move between my legs and between each finger as i walk not mastering space but in it and when the clouds open the sky suddenly wide and high no roof of leaves it seems there ’ s nowhere to go but into wind or water i climb the narrow stairs that keep turning twisting inward until they meet the ceiling which opens and i rise through the floor released into an openness i never learn to expect at the yellow table i sit and read an interview with picasso ’ s lover francoise gilot the only one to leave him and have another life she says she was not destroyed by him as the others were “ because i am of the stuff that can not be destroyed. ” i felt something blow through me then some devouring wind surely then i am of the stuff that can be destroyed haven ’ t i felt it the breaking of all i was don ’ t i sit and count my losses here in this room where all the life i knew has ended so bare with desire i seem to be eating sky that ’ s how it is here i ’ m lonely sad the wind blows along the roof and i can ’ t sleep rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor leaving dirty puddles on the boards a yellow table and a cupboard painted blue three chairs that do n't match or even balance rightly a dented bucket its metal reflecting darkly what is what can not be taken away what ’ s beautiful here the whole thing is beauty a clarity not in things but around them complete and still i seem to remain somehow myself to remain at least something at a loss to know how much can be taken from me and leave me only changed not ruined alert in an emptiness so alive i recognized it as my life what would be left the shape of it then this life i said some beauty or radiance an endless space i fall into or am taken up by a brightness that holds me gathers light in the center of empty space like a vision of the life i have not lived
if only god would save me i would know how to hurt you if only god would save me i would know who to sell my soul to anything is an autobiography but this is a conversation— william burroughs insisted literature lagged 50 years behind painting thinking no doubt about abstraction collage fragmentation his cut-ups but whatever that meant why always 50 years or however he presumed to rile other writers poetry probably does lag behind any credible media theory about it— so that if i put a pine tree into a poem a grove of pine trees and beyond them the sea you ’ d think it was the same tree wordsworth put there instead of two obligatory centuries of nature studies all those technicolor vistas torch songs couples drifting through leaves in salem commercials into one life and out another the way a junkie playing a writer a writer playing a priest so that when i finally blurted out you-betrayed-me i-wounded-you we ’ re-so-unhappy you assumed the burden of personal urgency supposed it was me speaking at the limits of my self-control and not the damned don ’ t cry temptation and leave her to heaven you open your mouth and a tradition dribbles out but that ’ s mimesis— how almost impossible to avoid mimesis anybody ’ s hardest truths prompting the most fractured constructions the way to think about god might be to disobey god if only god ’ s wish to remain hidden so that if everything is an autobiography this is a conversion as my lives flash before me why must the yearning for god trump all other yearnings you often hear converts confess the drinking his pills her sexual addiction concealed inside them a yearning for god— why not the other way around the admission of jesus into your life concealing instead the wish say a need to be fucked senseless drunk drugged screaming oh god oh god on a hotel bed god embraces our yearnings that afternoon my father heard his diagnosis of inoperable cancer my aunt barbara demanded we get him to lourdes she demanded this with a glass of vodka in her hand— she demanded this running her fingers up and down my leg— she demanded this before she passed out in her car— in the movie of my life my father died after i forgave him when my secret tormentor said may the ghosts of your dreams gnaw at your belly like a wolf under your jacket did she really want revenge or was she just killing time for me god is a hair shirt or he ’ s nothing for me god is a pain in the ass that ’ s mimesis again this hour i tell you things in confidence i might not tell everybody but i ’ ll tell you the world is a road under the wall to the church the world is a church the world is a road the world is a stone wall still he wanted her the way the cardinal wanted the caravaggio when the ill-advised possessor of the painting resisted— one night papal guards searched his house of course contraband came to light some illegal rifles when the ill-advised possessor of the painting went to prison— the cardinal got his caravaggio but i wasn ’ t a cardinal nephew to the pope and you— you were not a caravaggio so i asked you to be in my movie

for all of my years i ’ ve read only living signs— bodies in jealousy bodies in battle bodies growing disease like mushroom coral it is tiresome tiresome describing fir cones waiting for fires to catch their human ribs into some slow future forest my beloved he tires of me and he should— my complaints the same his recourse the same invoking the broad cool sheet suffering drapes over the living freeze of heart after heart and never by that heart ’ s fault—the heart did not make itself the face did not fashion its jutting jawbone to wail across the plains or beg the bare city i will no longer tally the broken ospreyed oceans the figs that outlived summer or the tedious mineral angles and their suction of light have you died then speak you must see the living are too small as they are lonesome for more and in varieties of pain only you can bring into right view

how something is made flesh no one can say the buffalo soup becomes a woman who sings every day to her horses or summons another to her private body saying come touch this is how it begins the path of a newly born who salvaged from other lives and worlds will grow to become a woman a man with a heart that never rests and the gathered berries the wild grapes enter the body human wine which can love where nothing created is wasted the swallowed grain takes you through the dreams of another night the deer meat becomes hands strong enough to work but i love most the white-haired creature eating green leaves the sun shines there swallowed showing in her face taking in all the light and in the end when the shadow from the ground enters the body and remains in the end you might say this is myself still unknown still a mystery
first there was some other order of things never spoken but in dreams of darkest creation then there was black earth lake the face of light on water then the thick forest all around that light and then the human clay whose blood we still carry rose up in us who remember caves with red bison painted in their own blood after their kind a wildness swam inside our mothers desire through closed eyes a new child wearing the red wet mask of birth delivered into this land already wounded stolen and burned beyond reckoning red is this yielding land turned inside out by a country of hunters with iron flint and fire red is the fear that turns a knife back against men holds it at their throats and they can not see the claw on the handle the animal hand that haunts them from some place inside their blood so that is hunting birth and one kind of death then there was medicine the healing of wounds red was the infinite fruit of stolen bodies the doctors wanted to know what invented disease how wounds healed from inside themselves how life stands up in skin if not by magic they divined the red shadows of leeches that swam in white bowls of water they believed stars in the cup of sky they cut the wall of skin to let what was bad escape but they were reading the story of fire gone out and that was a science as for the animal hand on death ’ s knife knives have as many sides as the red father of war who signs his name in the blood of other men and red was the soldier who crawled through a ditch of human blood in order to live it was the canal of his deliverance it is his son who lives near me red is the thunder in our ears when we meet love like creation is some other order of things red is the share of fire i have stolen from root hoof fallen fruit and this was hunger red is the human house i come back to at night swimming inside the cave of skin that remembers bison in that round nation of blood we are all burning red inseparable fires the living have crawled and climbed through in order to live so nothing will be left for death at the end this life in the fire i love it i want it this life
and yesterday something shattering happened not yesterday but several that ’ s becoming a favorite word weeks ago i came across kitaj ’ s the jewish rider and wept there he was in the very image of my stepfather the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic the same skinny legs the same misguided attempt to dress in a sporty way who ’ s watching the same abstractedness the same shlumpy—boneless—posture gazing not at the landscape flashing past with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one tug the countryside would vanish or listening to the tick of the rails but fixed—distractedly—on his lower extremities white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon socks to see whether or not he should roll them up … no looking both beyond and through physical space into an inner dark why else draw the eyes as shadows it ’ s his glimpse into another world my mother ’ s father hunted and rode my father rode and fished my stepfather never budged from his barca lounger once the amber liquid began to pour he had a spiritual life and a social life and no physical life but he liked it that i was always outside maybe that ’ s why he never got on my back about grades he might have thought that this boy has to be outside at this time in his life maybe it ’ s more important that he roam the canyons and the hills that he know the streets that he come home covered with leaves and bark and mud than that he sit there like a good young scholar like i was a rabbi at twenty giving money home to my parents in their cabbagy tenement in the bronx this is a boy who needs space one time— i think i had my learner 's permit— he rented a mustang convertible in l.a. and for several days i drove around past the long rows of used car lots and the bruised facades of restaurants digging up relatives my hoarse-voiced arthritic aunt in the shadows of her goldenrod colored ranch house limping like ruffian after her last run in the wet dirt at belmont stakes but i ’ ve said nothing about what made me weep it 's in the contrast between kitaj 's alter cocker seeking comfort on a train and rembrandt ’ s taut youth setting off into the rampant amber on horseback it ’ s in the image of active life juxtaposed with the image of sedentary contemplation— though no one travels on horseback now and heroism has become attending aids patients or sheltering the homeless the raw youth ’ s feet are planted lightly yet firmly in his stirrups his coat glows with many colors not so the jewish rider and yet—there 's something more michael hoffman writes that new york is not what it was when i was too young to have marked the existence of the blue note but i can pick up this trail by walking across the park to the frick and barbara hershey wouldn ’ t have been at the frick in 1959 they don ’ t allow children under sixteen in black skin tight pants black sweater the female uniform of our generation whose male version substitutes black jeans baseball hat and bomber jacket— though who knows what decorous garments she ’ d checked in the cloakroom and white boots with plenty of elizabethan ruff at the edges pausing to look at the polish rider while i scribbled notes her white boots stood out against the dominant dark like the jewish rider ’ s white loafers and that was good because the light in the painting is brief whatever the time of day sunrise or sunset and the rider ’ s gaze looking out over unknown space is inward i followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases where clouds roll over harbors against the whiteness of sails or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms then back to meet wisdom ’ s bared breast in veronese ’ s wisdom and strength… why didn ’ t veronese have the nerve to call his painting woman with bare breasts like tintoretto why an allegorical title when the bare flesh and bones and sinew would have done he spends his life looking not at far off hills or citadels or the lights in the village below he has no choice but to fix on her one bared breast her swelling nipple i can ’ t figure out what landscape he might be facing in the painted world the clatter of rocks and hooves echoes over the stony plain i was no rider but a pretend horse and rider always rode beside my train window—at a canter no matter how fast the rails clicked by— and though he wore a bandana and leaned slightly forward in the saddle to pull himself aboard his gaze wide-ranging yet intent was like the polish rider ’ s even as an only child i was never lonely my mother 's father rode until he was old and on a narrow pass his horse jammed him up against rockface in his narrative of his life this collision marked the ruin of his hip the rise of his cataracts my father rode “ every morning before work. ” i never witnessed that but at a ranch in upper new york state while i bloodied my hands tugging the reins of a frothing giant who would not budge from a weedpatch i watched him disappear in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs as he galloped over a far off hill more at ease in the saddle—in the air— than i ’ d ever seen him in civilian life my woman friend in el paso lives to ride only the jewish rider and i do not ride that ’ s the stuff of events what about the signature inscribed by the sun the dark clouds sinister in just being there thresholds exchanges going on in the village below candles lit in the deep interiors bread wine the plate making its way around the table what about— leaping centuries ahead— the energy from generators blazing like auras through the clouds the scattered lights the rotating tops of ambulances the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese making the rounds apple sauce passing from high chair to bib the wonder bread on a calcified plate children eating heads down in silence communicating through eye movements the mother wiping her lips the father grinning stupidly and drooling the television quacking in the background the perfect suburban night unfolding in bedroom and drive-in and den the sprinkler system ticking the snipers in the tower— this is what the riders guests everywhere and nowhere say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter as night comes down and last night driving to connecticut i understood that the polish rider gleans the permutations of light after dusk that its olive-gray smudges reflect the absence of pitch-darkness i was wrong about the polish rider all along he doesn ’ t depart at nightfall he stops for a moment crossing difficult terrain anticipating rockslide in the night because as the faint light rimming the edges of the sky makes clear night is not absolute black but rough-hewn and curious the rider lives in order to depart the woman who rode she hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house bare trees frost the whole bit i wanted our lives to be like that as rife with silences as a quaker meeting she came to me in her stride dropped her crop on the chair peeled off her britches and boots crawled under the covers her hour in the saddle had “ made her ready. ” i felt like an accessory the wound was open drowsily i rolled onto her no longer caring if she was using me as the new year wore on and black ice made riding a fast track to certain death or paralysis she grew tense came to me now with clinical terms “ schi ” words i worked hard to break down the good news was she was not a true “ split personality ” —the glitch that “ she was divorced from herself and could not love or care. ” the light in her house was like the light before dawn on the last of my rare visits her mother jarred preserves while we watched instant replays of robert kennedy die and die her father skulked upstairs perhaps testing gadgets or wishing me off his daughter or taking precautions i would not overhear what words were ricocheting on his “ hot line ” to the patent office any objective observer standing back from the distraction of the impinging present could see that her torment overleapt any visible signs and that she was— as a wasp “ rider ” —the wrong person for the place she was in her resilience could not be in question she lived to stray from known paths to leap stone fences and break into open fields when her horse went down in an irish bog and she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek— the next day she up and mounted him again when she came to me in the dream last night her smile had loosened how lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse how well it lit up the colors of her hair

boston snowbound logan closed snowplows and salt-trucks flashing yellow drifts tall as a man some places visibility poor i sit by the window and watch the snow blow sideways north-northeast hot cup in hand robe over pajamas you have made me to seek refuge and charged me to care for my brothers how cruel that could be you out there howling cracking the trees burying everything what could i possibly want from you that would not undo the whole world as it is
once in moonlight when i had not slept for three nights when there was no food and a long rain had stopped and some had slept outside in the rain you could see the streaks it had left on their skin once in the eighth week of my captivity alone in the moonlight outside on the ledge i looked up and felt the stars move strangely back and forth a slow rocking as though the lord were rocking us somehow back and forth and i was not afraid but tears came anyway as i remembered my children so far away the way children can call you back in through your thoughts and keep you awake like hearing the stars ring all night long and when you watch animals die when deer die you notice it how they don ’ t cry out— i could see it in my mind ’ s eye— they don ’ t cry out but lie there eyes open and then they are dead outside of themselves they are dead but inside themselves they have joined the earth where they have always been rocking and rocking.—and so i was able to sleep a few hours before our next remove miles and miles beyond the great river though i had lost track of our place in the world

because you used to leaf through the dictionary casually as someone might in a barber shop and devotedly as someone might in a sanctuary each letter would still have your attention if not for the responsibilities life has tightly fit like gears around the cog of you like so many petals hinged on a daisy that ’ s why i ’ ll just use your initial do you know that in one treasured story a jewish ancestor horseback in the woods at yom kippur and stranded without a prayer book looked into the darkness and realized he had merely to name the alphabet to ask forgiveness— no congregation of figures needed he could speak one letter at a time because all of creation proceeded from those he fed his horse and then quietly because it was from his heart he recited them slowly from aleph to tav within those sounds all others were born all manner of trials actions emotions everything needed to understand who he was had been how flaws venerate the human being how aspirations return without spite now for you may your wife ’ s x-ray return with good news may we raise our zarfs to both your names in the great book of life
for darlene wind and james welch i think of wind and her wild ways the year we had nothing to lose and lost it anyway in the cursed country of the fox we still talk about that winter how the cold froze imaginary buffalo on the stuffed horizon of snowbanks the haunting voices of the starved and mutilated broke fences crashed our thermostat dreams and we couldn ’ t stand it one more time so once again we lost a winter in stubborn memory walked through cheap apartment walls skated through fields of ghosts into a town that never wanted us in the epic search for grace like coyote like rabbit we could not contain our terror and clowned our way through a season of false midnights we had to swallow that town with laughter so it would go down easy as honey and one morning as the sun struggled to break ice and our dreams had found us with coffee and pancakes in a truck stop along highway 80 we found grace i could say grace was a woman with time on her hands or a white buffalo escaped from memory but in that dingy light it was a promise of balance we once again understood the talk of animals and spring was lean and hungry with the hope of children and corn i would like to say with grace we picked ourselves up and walked into the spring thaw we didn ’ t the next season was worse you went home to leech lake to work with the tribe and i went south and wind i am still crazy i know there is something larger than the memory of a dispossessed people we have seen it
prays for birds before an ancient icon— a stray cat the inbred need to pray is what makes god necessary and not she says the other way around beyond that it ’ s all mystery so don ’ t question why man creates gods that demand sacrifice condemning mortals to spend their lives trying to praise godhead into mercy better instead to ask the frog to bless the fly and once the cheese is in the trap to beg forgiveness from the rat

i don ’ t know when i stopped believing in heaven or if i do maybe i just stopped receiving heaven the sun rose i climbed into the pines ’ brittle crowns you could say i was retrieving heaven not a place or a time but blindness to everything but one light pulsing pleasing heaven we married in september everyone was still wearing their summer shirts sleeves of heaven it was white there was a bend and the car spun it was then i prayed pleading with heaven when he goes limp lie him down on the gurney mom oxygen mask breathing heaven the hospital shines our son flies in and out the snow falls hard relieving heaven he loves the colors of planets i teach him their lifelessness beautiful deceiving heaven i don ’ t know who is buried beneath me but i hear her break as i am leaving heaven how can you cry for one ruined life maria when you could be grieving for heaven
“ fly at once ” he said “ all is discovered. ” — edward gorey in miami this may afternoon i look up the sky hot so hot always and heating up hotter — how long i have loved this scene the clouds are white optimistic churches i can not number them herons pelicans and gulls glide like dreams through cloud-portals cloud-porticos and cloud-porte-cochères giotto could have done with his passion for blues and dimensions hard not to love a place always called by possibility nearby cuba is singing and somewhere here richard blanco is writing his poems as i enter the city my bishop walks with a cane towards our cathedral the sun shines on the people and unites us in a delirium of light high above this bleached scorched fragile groin-scented peninsula the birds track their insects and remain loyal to their nests i look up and i feel bliss building as i did when my father read another book to me and another the pages like wings there are moments of memorable patience in this world airplanes advance towards miami international booked with jewish retirees and cuban émigrés— their descending engines disrupt the white-gloved illegal waiters at the country clubs in coral gables who deliver flan to the ladies who have pulled their skin behind their ears like gum this is a place where few decisions are doubted on south beach where everyone rearranges or expands their sexual parts there seems to be no life outside the physical and time becomes a tricky thing here spring looks like winter winter like spring the scenes dense shifting shut — and before you know it the rats have preached from the mangoes and then chewed them to corpses and look how the interior decorators unroll their fresh bolts and wink-wink to new clients — what would be considered frivolous anywhere else is here pondered and coerced at great length the feminine gains strength moving closer to the cathedral the sea presses the harbor wanting to be loved pushing up the cruise ships with its muscles the sea says “ i am the sea. ” we have seen cubans come atop dolphins ’ backs here mothers have drowned for their sons but the cool gray backs of the dolphins have buoyed their children to us numbed by the lullaby of sonar clicks the sea blesses the city the way mothers do — forceful pushy ungraspable persistent the black mangrove shoots take root on the porous chalky rock building themselves up like steeples listen how the waves love what does not love them back pedicurists buff the toenails of the sugar daddies in the delano lincoln road refines its scarlet seductions bees are sticky with tourism inside the motel rooms of the rose red-orange petals from the royal poincianas tint the minutes with flamboyance the pink and white bottlebrush trees explode with seeds i will always love my time in this city you might say craziest of cities delivering its youth in short-shorts and rollerblades with rainbow sweatbands city smelling of unzipped things cha cha cha cha cha cha i do not think the city will ever be mine beautiful spanish and broken english spoken everywhere how i love that sound for it is the sound of people making their way where they were not born maids from honduras push their carts stacking their wrapped soaps counting them like children their cuticles sting with disinfectant perspiration staining their uniforms as they pray over the toilet seats they clean o miami for a decade i did not speak to my parents are you listening to me i will not bore you with details instead i will tell you something new listen to me i was angry but the reasons no longer interest me i take the liberty of assuming you approve of forgiveness stressing hardening gentleness as you do i speak to the bishop about my call and the sacraments we discuss blessings absolutions consecrations— our work of the soul the soul has no sex and i am relieved to speak of a thing alive in the world that has no sex the bishop places a paperweight atop my reports on his desk our professional talk is measured by the silence of the dead who are always flinging open their shutters religion being the work of the living and the dead the hope and release in the hearts of parents turning to their children and the hearts of children turning to their parents — all that business in life that remains unrehearsed superior to obedient we pray the laughter of the bathers through the grillwork of the office window pleases me their movements rinsed in the baptism of the sea the languorous sea the sky at the end of the city trembles light and dust warm to cream to pink to lavender miami it has been a gorgeous day indeed thank you how i love your decks bridges promenades and balconies — the paraphernalia of connection how fast the pastels encroach upon the edges i have a dinner engagement in coral gables at books books where i will see the poet richard blanco i hope he will tell me stories of his beloved broken cuba nearly five o ’ clock now and i am late when i arrive richard blanco speaks of cuba as i had wished and the city quiets all around him “ if our bodies house our souls ” i think to myself “ then richard poets are the interior decorators of the mind. ” richard blanco is saying something about going back his relatives singing poems in the fields i listen behind us in the palmetum at the fairchild tropical botanic gardens the elephant date malaysian kiwi coconut and royal palms ask the city to remember their names with the insistence of priests good-bye miami good-bye good-bye to the workers laying down the grids of the concrete embeds on the high-rises reinforcing their masculine nests gluing glass with their spermy compounds to stone and steel good-bye to you south beach let your rapturous sands darken to a deep grape color let the polished feet of youth launch into their surprises and swaps let the elements cool good-bye richard blanco good-bye today my candidacy for holy orders was affirmed i listen to the sea flatten cuba pleads in the distance one more night honduras waits on too many things to count no longer can i stand still stars smooth the sea with their immaculate highways of long lights mother and father forgive me my absence i will always be moving quietly toward you

5pm on the nose they open their mouths and it rolls out high shrill and metallic first the boy then his sister occasionally they both let loose at once and i think of putting on my shoes to go up and see whether it is merely an experiment their parents have been conducting upon the good crystal which must surely lie shattered to dust on the floor maybe the mother is still proud of the four pink lungs she nursed to such might perhaps if they hit the magic decibel the whole building will lift-off and we 'll ride to glory like elijah if this is it—if this is what their cries are cocked toward—let the sky pass from blue to red to molten gold to black let the heaven we inherit approach whether it is our dead in old testament robes or a door opening onto the roiling infinity of space whether it will bend down to greet us like a father or swallow us like a furnace i 'm ready to meet what refuses to let us keep anything for long what teases us with blessings bends us with grief wizard thief the great wind rushing to knock our mirrors to the floor to sweep our short lives clean how mean our racket seems beside it my stereo on shuffle the neighbor chopping onions through a wall all of it just a hiccough against what may never come for us and the kids upstairs still at it screaming like the dawn of man as if something they have no name for has begun to insist upon being born

it was adolphe sax remember not saxo grammaticus who gets the ovation and by the time he had brought all the components together–the serpentine shape the single reed the fit of the fingers the upward tilt of the golden bell– it was already 1842 and one gets the feeling that it was also very late at night there is something nocturnal about the sound something literally horny as some may have noticed on that historic date when the first odd notes wobbled out of his studio into the small darkened town summoning the insomniacs who were up waiting for the invention of jazz to their windows but leaving the sleepers undisturbed evening deepening and warming the waters of their dreams for this is not the valved instrument of waking more the smoky voice of longing and loss the porpoise cry of the subconscious no one would ever think of blowing reveille on a tenor without irony the men would only lie in their metal bunks fingers twined behind their heads afloat on pools of memory and desire and when the time has come to rouse the dead you will not see gabriel clipping an alto around his numinous neck an angel playing the world ’ s last song on a glistening saxophone might be enough to lift them back into the light of earth but really no further once resurrected they would only lie down in the long cemetery grass or lean alone against a lugubrious yew and let the music do the ascending– curling snakes charmed from their baskets– while they wait for the shrill trumpet solo that will blow them all to kingdom come

lord pray pray loudly against the noise of the human hand which seeks to drown you out and appear on quiet soles so that we might understand your footsteps exert yourself in order to recognize our prayers even when they appear in a different garment because no prayer ever looses itself from the source of the one praying • lord take up the speech by which i pray to you grant me the gestures which have grown within me in your absence so that i might remain true to my uneducable nature and take your weakness upon me • lord you should always wander and never let yourself settle down because there are no longer any dwelling places only footsteps be loud and penetrating sympathize with me and my stirrings lead me all the way to your bread so that my word might wake • lord stay by me even if i nourish myself from ashes and salt be still and listen to that name which i lend to you because i want to distinguish you from the idols grant me patience to endure those who are vain with their empty words and the converts who are zealous to confirm their opposite and grant that my waiting be full of revolt • lord when you arrive we will be light bread and water the table is set and the door opened come and take your place among us free me of the belief that you are only faithful from a distance and speak with me in the unharried language of animals who from far off lie in wait for us with their unadulterated hunger

where lord will i find you your place is high and obscured and where won ’ t i find you your glory fills the world you dwell deep within— you ’ ve fixed the ends of creation you stand a tower for the near refuge to those far off you ’ ve lain above the ark here yet live in the highest heavens exalted among your hosts although beyond their hymns— no heavenly sphere could ever contain you let alone a chamber within in being borne above them on an exalted throne you are closer to them than their breath and skin their mouths bear witness for them that you alone gave them form your kingdom ’ s burden is theirs who wouldn ’ t fear you and who could fail to search for you— who sends down food when it is due i sought your nearness with all my heart i called you and in my going out to meet you i found you coming toward me as in the wonders of your might and holy works i saw you who would say he hasn ’ t seen your glory as the heavens ’ hordes declare their awe of you without a sound being heard but could the lord in truth dwell in men on earth how would men you made from the dust and clay fathom your presence there enthroned upon their praise the creatures hovering over the world praise your wonders— your throne borne high above their heads as you bear all forever
it ’ s not paradise i ’ m looking for but the naming i hardly gave a thought to call it the gift i carried in my loneliness among the animals before i started listening to the news call it the hint i had about the knowledge that would explode in the meantime which is real time plus the past you ’ re swishing your skirt and speaking french which is more than i can take which i marvel at like a boy from the most distant seat in the kronos dome where i am one of so many now i see the point of falling off there ’ s not enough seats for us all to attend the eschaton this ecstasy that plants beauty on my tongue so that if it were a wing i ’ d be flying with the quickness of a hummingbird and grace of a heron is so much mercy in light of the darkness that comes who would say consolation who would say dross not that anyone would blame them all night i hear so many echoes in the forest i ’ m tempted to look back to save myself in hindsight where all i see is the absence of me where all i hear is your voice which couldn ’ t be more strange how to go on walking hand in hand without our bodies on the path we made for our feet talking talking

to-night again the moon ’ s white mat stretches across the dormitory floor while outside like an evil cat the pion prowls down the dark corridor planning i know to pounce on me in spite for getting leave to sleep in town last night but it was none of us who made that noise only the old brown owl that hoots and flies out of the ivy—he will say it was us boys— seigneur mon dieu the sacré soul of spies he would like to catch each dream that lies hidden behind our sleepy eyes their dream but mine—it is the moon and the wood that sees all my long life how i shall hate the trees in the place d ’ armes the dusty planes all summer through dozed with the market women in the sun and scarcely stirred to see the quiet things that crossed the square— a tiny funeral the flying shadow of a bird the hump-backed barber célestin lemaire old madame michel in her three-wheeled chair and filing past to vespers two and two the demoiselles of the pensionnat towed like a ship through the harbour bar safe into port where le petit jésus perhaps makes nothing of the look they shot at you si c ’ est défendu mais que voulez-vous it was the sun the sunshine weaves a pattern on dull stones the sunshine leaves the portraiture of dreams upon the eyes before it dies all summer through the dust hung white upon the drowsy planes till suddenly they woke with the autumn rains it is not only the little boys who have hardly got away from toys but i who am seventeen next year some nights in bed have grown cold to hear that lonely passion of the rain which makes you think of being dead and of somewhere living to lay your head as if you were a child again crying for one thing known and near your empty heart to still the hunger and the fear that pelts and beats with it against the pane but i remember smiling too at all the sun ’ s soft tricks and those autumn dreads in winter time when the grey light broke slowly through the frosted window-lace to drag us shivering from our beds and when at dusk the singing wind swung down straight from the stars to the dark country roads beyond the twinkling town striking the leafless poplar boughs as he went by like some poor stray dog by the wayside lying dead we left behind us the old world of dread i and the wind as we strode whistling on under the winter sky and then in spring for three days came the fair just as the planes were starting into bud above the caravans you saw the dancing bear pass on his chain and heard the jingle and the thud only four days ago they let you out of this dull show to slither down the montagne russe and chaff the man à la tête de veau hit slick the bull 's eye at the tir spin round and round till your head went queer on the porcs-roulants oh là là fête va pour du vin et le tête-a-tête with the girl who sugars the gaufres pauvrette how thin she was but she smiled you bet as she took your tip— “ one does not forget the good days monsieur ” said with a grace but sacrebleu what a ghost of a face and no fun too for the demoiselles of the pensionnat who were hurried past with their “ oh que c ’ est beau—ah qu ’ elle est belle ” a lap-dog ’ s life from first to last the good nights are not made for sleep nor the good days for dreaming in and at the end in the big circus tent we sat and shook and stewed like sin some children there had got—but where sent from the south perhaps—a red bouquet of roses sweetening the fetid air with scent from gardens by some far away blue bay they threw one at the dancing bear the white clown caught it from st. rémy ’ s tower the deep slow bell tolled out the hour the black clown with his dirty grin lay sprawling in the dust as she rode in she stood on a white horse—and suddenly you saw the bend of a far-off road at dawn with knights riding by a field of spears—and then the gallant day go out in storm with ragged clouds low down sullen and grey against red heavens wild and awful such a sky as witnesses against you at the end of a great battle bugles blowing blood and dust— the old morte d ’ arthur fight you must— it died in anger but it was not death that had you by the throat stopping your breath she looked like victory she rode my way she laughed at the black clown and then she flew a bird above us on the wing of her white arms and you saw through a rent in the old tent a patch of sky with one dim star she flew but not so high— and then she did not fly she stood in the bright moonlight at the door of a strange room she threw her slippers on the floor— again again you heard the patter of the rain the starving rain—it was this thing summer was this the gold mist in your eyes — oh god it dies but after death— to-night the splendour and the sting blows back and catches at your breath the smell of beasts the smell of dust the scent of all the roses in the world the sea the spring the beat of drums the pad of hoofs music the dream the dream the enchanted thing at first you scarcely saw her face you knew the maddening feet were there what called was that half-hidden white unrest to which now and then she pressed her finger-tips but as she slackened pace and turned and looked at you it grew quite bare there was not anything you did not dare — like trumpeters the hours passed until the last day of the fair in the place d ’ armes all afternoon the building birds had sung “ soon soon ” the shuttered streets slept sound that night it was full moon the path into the wood was almost white the trees were very still and seemed to stare not far before your soul the dream flits on but when you touch it it is gone and quite alone your soul stands there mother of christ no one has seen your eyes how can men pray even unto you there were only wolves ’ eyes in the wood— my mother is a woman too nothing is true that is not good with that quick smile of hers i have heard her say — i wish i had gone back home to-day i should have watched the light that so gently dies from our high window in the paris skies the long straight chain of lamps hung out along the seine i would have turned to her and let the rain beat on her breast as it does against the pane — nothing will be the same again — there is something strange in my little mother ’ s eyes there is something new in the old heavenly air of spring— the smell of beasts the smell of dust—the enchanted thing all my life long i shall see moonlight on the fern and the black trunks of trees only the hair of any woman can belong to god the stalks are cruelly broken where we trod there had been violets there i shall not care as i used to do when i see the bracken burn
here in the darkness where this plaster saint stands nearer than god stands to our distress and one small candle shines but not so faint as the far lights of everlastingness i ’ d rather kneel than over there in open day where christ is hanging rather pray to something more like my own clay not too divine for once perhaps my little saint before he got his niche and crown had one short stroll about the town it brings him closer just that taint— and anyone can wash the paint off our poor faces his and mine is that why i see monty now equal to any saint poor boy as good as gold but still with just the proper trace of earthliness on his shining wedding face and then gone suddenly blank and old the hateful day of the divorce stuart got his hands down of course crowing like twenty cocks and grinning like a horse but monty took it hard all said and done i liked him best — he was the first he stands out clearer than the rest it seems too funny all we other rips should have immortal souls monty and redge quite damnably keep theirs afloat while we go down like scuttled ships.— it ’ s funny too how easily we sink one might put up a monument i think to half the world and cut across it “ lost at sea ” i should drown jim poor little sparrow if i netted him to-night— no it ’ s no use this penny light— or my poor saint with his tin-pot crown— the trees of calvary are where they were when we are sure that we can spare the tallest let us go and strike it down and leave the other two still standing there i too would ask him to remember me if there were any paradise beyond this earth that i could see oh quiet christ who never knew the poisonous fangs that bite us through and make us do the things we do see how we suffer and fight and die how helpless and how low we lie god holds you and you hang so high though no one looking long at you can think you do not suffer too but up there from your still star-lighted tree what can you know what can you really see of this dark ditch the soul of me we are what we are when i was half a child i could not sit watching black shadows on green lawns and red carnations burning in the sun without paying so heavily for it that joy and pain like any mother and her unborn child were almost one i could hardly bear the dreams upon the eyes of white geraniums in the dusk the thick close voice of musk the jessamine music on the thin night air or sometimes my own hands about me anywhere — the sight of my own face for it was lovely then even the scent of my own hair oh there was nothing nothing that did not sweep to the high seat of laughing gods and then blow down and beat my soul into the highway dust as hoofs do the dropped roses of the street i think my body was my soul and when we are made thus who shall control our hands our eyes the wandering passion of our feet who shall teach us to thrust the world out of our heart to say till perhaps in death when the race is run and it is forced from us with our last breath “ thy will be done ” if it is your will that we should be content with the tame bloodless things as pale as angels smirking by with folded wings— oh i know virtue and the peace it brings the temperate well-worn smile the one man gives you when you are evermore his own and afterwards the child ’ s for a little while with its unknowing and all-seeing eyes so soon to change and make you feel how quick the clock goes round if one had learned the trick— how does one though quite early on of long green pastures under placid skies one might be walking now with patient truth what did we ever care for it who have asked for youth when oh my god this is going or has gone there is a portrait of my mother at nineteen with the black spaniel standing by the garden seat the dainty head held high against the painted green and throwing out the youngest smile shy but half haughty and half sweet her picture then but simply youth or simply spring to me to-day a radiance on the wall so exquisite so heart-breaking a thing beside the mask that i remember shrunk and small sapless and lined like a dead leaf all that was left of oh the loveliest face by time and grief and in the glass last night i saw a ghost behind my chair— yet why remember it when one can still go moderately gay— or could—with any one of the old crew but oh these boys the solemn way they take you and the things they say— this “ i have only as long as you ” when you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two— although at heart perhaps—god if it were only the face only the hair if jim had written to me as he did to-day a year ago—and now it leaves me cold— i know what this means old old old et avec ça—mais on a vécu tout se paie that is not always true there was my mother well at least the dead are free yoked to the man that father was yoked to the woman i am monty too the little portress at the convent school stewing in hell so patiently the poor fair boy who shot himself at aix and what of me—and what of me but i i paid for what i had and they for nothing no one can not see how it shall be made up to them in some serene eternity if there were fifty heavens god could not give us back the child who went or never came here on our little patch of this great earth the sun of any darkened day not one of all the starry buds hung on the hawthorn trees of last year ’ s may no shadow from the sloping fields of yesterday for every hour they slant across the hedge a different way the shadows are never the same “ find rest in him ” one knows the parsons ’ tags— back to the fold across the evening fields like any flock of baa-ing sheep yes it may be when he has shorn led us to slaughter torn the bleating soul in us to rags for so he giveth his belovèd sleep oh he will take us stripped and done driven into his heart so we are won then safe safe are we in the shelter of his everlasting wings— i do not envy him his victories his arms are full of broken things but i shall not be in them let him take the finer ones the easier to break and they are not gone yet for me the lights the colours the perfumes though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms in silks and in gemlike wines here even in this corner where my little candle shines and overhead the lancet-window glows with golds and crimsons you could almost drink to know how jewels taste just as i used to think there was the scent in every red and yellow rose of all the sunsets but this place is grey and much too quiet no one here why this is awful this is fear nothing to see no face nothing to hear except your heart beating in space as if the world was ended dead at last dead soul dead body tied together fast these to go on with and alone to the slow end no one to sit with really or to speak to friend to friend out of the long procession black or white or red not one left now to say “ still i am here then see you dear lay here your head ” only the doll ’ s house looking on the park to-night all nights i know when the man puts the lights out very dark with upstairs in the blue and gold box of a room just the maids footsteps overhead then utter silence and the empty world—the room—the bed— the corpse no not quite dead while this cries out in me but nearly very soon to be a handful of forgotten dust— there must be someone christ there must tell me there will be someone who if there were no one else could it be you how old was mary out of whom you cast so many devils was she young or perhaps for years she had sat staring with dry eyes at this and that man going past till suddenly she saw you on the steps of simon ’ s house and stood and looked at you through tears i think she must have known by those the thing for what it was that had come to her for some of us there is a passion i suppose so far from earthly cares and earthly fears that in its stillness you can hardly stir or in its nearness lift your hand so great that you have simply got to stand looking at it through tears through tears then straight from these there broke the kiss i think you must have known by this the thing for what it was that had come to you she did not love you like the rest it was in her own way but at the worst the best she gave you something altogether new and through it all from her no word she scarcely saw you scarcely heard surely you knew when she so touched you with her hair or by the wet cheek lying there and while her perfume clung to you from head to feet all through the day that you can change the things for which we care but even you unless you kill us not the way this then was peace for her but passion too i wonder was it like a kiss that once i knew the only one that i would care to take into the grave with me to which if there were afterwards to wake almost as happy as the carven dead in some dim chancel lying head by head we slept with it but face to face the whole night through— one breath one throbbing quietness as if the thing behind our lips was endless life lost as i woke to hear in the strange earthly dawn his “ are you there ” and lie still listening to the wind outside among the firs so mary chose the dream of him for what was left to her of night and day it is the only truth it is the dream in us that neither life nor death nor any other thing can take away but if she had not touched him in the doorway of the dream could she have cared so much she was a sinner we are what we are the spirit afterwards but first the touch and he has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees of eden and calvary with its ghosts that have not any eyes for tears and the happier guests who would not see or if they did remember these though they lived there a thousand years outside too gravely looking at me he seems to stand and looking at him if my forgotten spirit came unwillingly back what could it claim of those calm eyes that quiet speech breaking like a slow tide upon the beach the scarred not quite human hand — unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings when it has learned so long not to think not to be again again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things that i shall not see i can not bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head when i was small i never quite believed that he was dead and at the convent school i used to lie awake in bed thinking about his hands it did not matter what they said he was alive to me so hurt so hurt and most of all in holy week when there was no one else to see i used to think it would not hurt me too so terribly if he had ever seemed to notice me or if for once he would only speak
not for that city of the level sun its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze— the shadeless sleepless city of white days white nights or nights and days that are as one— we weary when all is said all thought all done we strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see what from the threshold of eternity we shall step into no i think we shun the splendour of that everlasting glare the clamour of that never-ending song and if for anything we greatly long it is for some remote and quiet stair which winds to silence and a space for sleep too sound for waking and for dreams too deep
tulips panted against the wall so much need to feed a crisp stem i thought as we put our fingers in the bullet holes above the bed typed captions translated photos of rivera kahlo trotsky and his wife in her boxy suit devoted smile that hopeful hat with bent feather below an image of the assassin who would get her husband in the end george herbert was what i translated the temple the only book i brought where he says the heart must be a stone on which to build god ’ s altar—no love without affliction my hard heart meets in this frame in those days i loved the jungle spread like wool below an unsteady sky and the crumbling pyramid ’ s altar top flocked with moonlight i loved the monkeys throwing sticks and rinds at tourists from their nests in the trees the noise at night the hysterical crush of insect limbs rubbing animal want all night banged against the window each with an urgent song of me me me how loud the fecund world can be mi corazon duro i wrote bored and smoke rose from other tables from the wheels of the cars on the cobbled roads and once i saw a mouse suicidal enter the frantic crowd i cried out at the park in mexico city where indians ropes on their ankles dove like fatal birds to the ground while a hassid in his 19th-century cloak kept after me speak english english he said we ’ ve all become vegetarians there isn ’ t a butcher for miles i watched his black hat disappear into the swarm of vendors masked dancers was that it devotion young and gorgeous for it i crept away one night met a german hippie and he pulled my swimsuit aside in the volcanic lake the fat costa rican ’ s coffee plantation unfolded below the ranging packs of filthy dogs the water so hot and sulfured i gleamed like something ephemeral sometimes i saw movies cheap hong kong action films dubbed into spanish with mandarin subtitles but that started to get difficult the young men dying with extravagance the improbable ballet of whizzing swords gun fights in teahouses filled with caged birds herbert consumptive and small country parish-bound wrote that struggle must be the same as resolution as faith itself while he suffocated in his sad minister ’ s bed for years arguing with god and himself it ’ s the uglier business willing yourself from despair to belief in those days i thought the saints robes heavy with must with ancient gnarled hands deserved the nothing they felt their way toward in those days my favorite saints were the ones who burned away young—i admired them in the cathedral paintings hooded eyes the brutal wings of their ribs gilt halos baroque frames what does it mean devotion mothers weep in the corners of those paintings while a man each morning sweeps the church floor
that we await a blessed hope that we will be struck with great fear like a baby taken into the night that every boot every improvised explosive talon hornet molotov rubber-coated bullet every unexploded cluster bomblet every kevlar suicide vest unpiloted drone raining fire on wedding parties will be burned as fuel in the dark season that we will learn the awful hunger of god the nerve-fraying cry of god the curdy vomit of god the soiled swaddle of god the constant wakefulness of god alongside the sweet scalp of god the contented murmur of god the limb-twitched dream- reaching of god we ’ re dizzy in every departure limb-lost we can not sleep in the wake of god god will not sleep the infant dream for long we lift the blinds look out into ink for light my god my god open the spine binding our sight

i thou hast made me known to friends whom i knew not thou hast given me seats in homes not my own thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger i am uneasy at heart when i have to leave my accustomed shelter i forgot that there abides the old in the new and that there also thou abidest through birth and death in this world or in others wherever thou leadest me it is thou the same the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar when one knows thee then alien there is none then no door is shut oh grant me my prayer that i may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of the many ii no more noisy loud words from me such is my master ’ s will hence-forth i deal in whispers the speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song men hasten to the king ’ s market all the buyers and sellers are there but i have my untimely leave in the middle of the day in the thick of work let then the flowers come out in my garden though it is not their time and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum full many an hour have i spent in the strife of the good and the evil but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him and i know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence iii on the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying and i knew it not my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded only now and again a sadness fell upon me and i started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south wind that vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion i knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart iv by all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world but it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs and thou keepest me free lest i forget them they never venture to leave me alone but day passes by after day and thou are not seen if i call not thee in my prayers if i keep not thee in my heart—thy love for me still waits for my love v i was not aware of the moment when i first crossed the threshold of this life what was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight when in the morning i looked upon the light i felt in a moment that i was no stranger in this world that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother even so in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me and because i love this life i know i shall love death as well the child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left one vi thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well oh thou beautiful there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colors and sounds and odors there comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty silently to crown the earth and there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds through trackless paths carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest but there where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in reigns the stainless white radiance there is no day nor night nor form nor color and never never a word originally appeared in the december 1912 issue of poetry magazine

a blind man on the thoroughfare startle-eyed as an owl by day piping a dismal little air taps here and there loses his way tootles awry his time-old ditty undauntedly as by his side lopes his dog guides him through the city specter diurnal sleepy-eyed days stark wash over him unlit he hears the dark world ’ s constant din and all that life unseen as it rolls rushing like a flood walled in god knows what black chimeras haunt that brain opaque what lot befalls and what dire spells the mind is wont to scribble on those death-vault walls like prisoner grown half-mad who pent rots beneath venice in her jail eternal and whose hours are spent scratching a message with a nail ... but when the torch in tomb immured dies in the breath of death maybe the soul to shades ’ gloom long inured will see with deathly clarity

hope fills me this morning as i fashion letters into a tree that sighs that stays put yet moves reaching to its limits swaying and settling a compass pointing to its place on earth where every morning it blocks the sun for me at work in my studio where i scratch and scrawl and loop letters into shapes so i can enter the tabernacle of their bodies and hear each foot each syllable sending its roots to a depth as great as that tree ’ s which has been standing and rooting and swaying long before i came to memorize its plain mystery its wide-bodied hull open to stars at night each a point that i lengthen into a letter and each letter into a word and with the words build a tabernacle for the ten most broken and the ten most resonant words i will place them in an inner sanctum enclosed by hanging carpets and outside it another space enclosed by carpets and outside it another so that those who wish to read the words to say them out loud must first pull one curtain back and step inside and then another and another until they arrive in a hushed space a soundproofed heavy quiet where they come to know that which makes all things day after day and out of which the earth was made stepping behind each curtain they learn that the mystery of making is not a secret hidden within but a series of moves a sequence of steps outlined on a blueprint with notes and call-outs white on black constellations in the night sky the primordial living torah circulating in the letters as trees circulate light capturing it with their leaves caching it within the soil then drawing it back up watering the tallest branches with the radiant dark

in order to perfect all readers the statements should be carved on rock walls on cave walls and on the side of pillars so the charm of their instruction can affect the mountain climbers near the cliffs the plainsmen near the pillars and the city people near the caves they go to on vacations the statements should and in a fair script spell out the right text and gloss of the philosopher ’ s jocular remark text “ honesty is the best policy. ” gloss “ he means not ‘ best ’ but ‘ policy ’ this is the joke of it whereas in fact honesty is honesty best is best and policy is policy the three terms being not related but here loosely allied what is more important is that ‘ is ’ is but the rocklike truth of the text resides in the ‘ the ’ the ‘ the ’ is the by this means the amusing sage has raised or caused to be raised the triple standard in stone the single is too simple for life the double is mere degrading hypocrisy but the third combines the first two in a possible way and contributes something unsayable of its own this is the pit nut seed or stone of the fruit when the fruit has been digested it is good to do good for the wrong reason better to do good for the good reason and best of all to do good good i.e when the doer and doee and whatever passes between them are beyond all words like ‘ grace ’ or ‘ anagogic insight ’ or definitions like ‘ particular instance of a hoped-at-law ’ and which the rocks alone can convey this is the real reason for the rock walls the cave walls and pillars and not the base desires for permanence and display that the teacher ’ s conceit suggests. ” that is the end of the statements but in order to go on a way after the end so as to make up for having begun after the beginning and thus to come around to it in order to include the whole thing add “ in some places the poignant slogan ‘ morality is a bad joke like everything else ’ may be written or not granted that space exists for the vulgar remarks the dates initials and hearts of lovers and all other graffiti of the prisoners of this world ”

a momentary rupture to the vision the wavering limbs of a birch fashion the fluttering hem of the deity ’ s garment the cooling cup of coffee the ocean the deity waltzes across this is enough—but sometimes the deity ’ s heady ta-da coaxes the cherries in our mental slot machine to line up and our brains summon flickering silver like salmon spawning a river the jury decides in our favor and we ’ re free to see for now a flaw swells from the facets of a day increasing the day ’ s value a freakish postage stamp mails our envelope outside time hairy claw-like magnolia buds bloom from bare branches and the deity pops up again like a girl from a giant cake o deity you transfixing transgressor translating back and forth on the border without a passport fleeing revolutions of same-old simultaneous boredom and boredom we hoard epiphanies under the bed stuff them in jars and bury them in the backyard we cram our closet with sunrise prop up our feet and drink gallons of wow we visit the doctor because all this is raising the blood ’ s levels of c6h3 oh 2chohch2nhch3 the heart caught in the deity ’ s hem and haw the oh unfurling from our chest like a bee from our cup of coffee an autochthonous greeting there who saw it

to pass over in silence is to acknowledge logic the necessity of form the stunning curve of language the curious way it seems to turn out that “ love ” means “ need ” even in a lush garden to pass over the red sea or your bounty—so long as true silence and not some tense paralysis of the false is achieved—then passover is always a charity the painted fish in the blue water turns to their own colors to pass over in silence is to acknowledge you if this chatter dissolve as it will in the marvelous sky

for nathan gebert i the chair from goodwill smelled of mildew i sat with sister ann a franciscan in her small office at the cenacle retreat house right off dixie highway in lantana florida i began my story— it was an interview much of life is an interview she said i did not need to pay her but donations yes donations were appreciated they could be left anonymously in a plain white envelope that she could take back to the cloister she was dressed in a turtleneck and a denim jumper she could have been mistaken in a grocery store for an aging housewife my meetings with her went on for a few years i had come to speak about durell i did not know how to end sentences about durell he had taught me—what to live not to wince in the mirror what there were so many ways to end my sentence he was

in a way my own which would not exactly be correct no not exactly durell was dead i said and i needed to make sense of things sister ann ’ s face was open fragile— parts were chipped like on a recovered fresco above her gray head a garish postcard of the emmaus scene the colors off as if painted by numbers with no concern for shading— the style of it had an unoriginal catholic institutional uniformity there it hung askew in its golden drugstore frame it was the scene from the end of luke the two disciples one named cleopas the other anonymous forever mumbling christ ’ s name and with them the resurrected christ masquerading as a stranger they were on their way to that town emmaus seven miles out from jerusalem gossiping about the impress of christ ’ s vanishing— they argued about whether to believe what they had seen they were restless back and forth the debate went— when there is estrangement there is little peace ii every time we met sister ann prayed first at times my recollections blurred or a presumption would reverse sister ann told me durell was with me still in a more intimate way than when he lived she frequently lost her equilibrium as older people sometimes do before settling into her worn-out chair where she listened to me week after week the day i met durell i said the morning light was clear startling the town with ornament the steeple of christ church held the horizon in place or so i imagined as if it had been painted first with confident amounts of titanium white before the rest was added trees clattered the reiterating brick puzzle of cambridge brightened— mass avenue mount auburn dunster holyoke— proclaimed a new september and new students trudged the streets every blood-warm structure was defined in relief hours before while the moon ’ s neck wobbled on the charles like a giraffe ’ s or the ghost of a giraffe ’ s neck i imagined durell labored having slept only a few hours caged in his worries of doctor bills no money and running out of people to ask for it mulling over mistakes broken love affairs— a hospital orderly a man upstairs he probably mumbled unkind epithets about blacks and jews even though the men he loved were blacks and jews some of his blasphemies if you want to call them that embarrassed me in front of sister ann but she seemed unflappably tolerant at sixty he was unemployable he had taught school and guarded buildings each job ending worse than the last his refrain was always “ it is not easy being an impoverished aristocrat. ” he spoke with the old harvard accent i can still hear it i will probably always hear it with new york city the north shore and the army mixed in the a ’ s broadened the r ’ s were flat the t ’ s snapped— so a sentence would calibrate to a confident close like “ my dee-ah boy that is that. ” he lived on 19 garden street in a rent-controlled studio on the second floor number 25 he said the “ 25 ” reminded him of christmas at eleven o ’ clock he probably pulled on his support hose increasing the circulation in his legs blotched green and black next he would have locked the door with his gold key and moved deliberately his smile beleaguered bowing to miss littlefield in the landlord ’ s office at the building ’ s dark cubbyhole of an entrance they probably spoke of queen elizabeth ii her disappointments for miss littlefield and he were royalists both then durell began to move towards me entering the square breathing heavily he might have passed the brattle advertising judgment at nuremberg— inside the shut black theatrical box where the world repeated the past maximilian schell interrogated judy garland and montgomery clift marlene dietrich let the phone ring and ring maybe he passed the store 24 sign bright orange passed nini ’ s corner where sex magazines were stacked like a cliff maybe maybe but maybe not maybe he went another way then i recalled how the t shook that place the subway grates pushing up the scent of rat-life and all things fallen mixing with leavitt peirce exuding its masculine snuff down plympton street he might have gone past the grolier which i always remembered for some reason as closed gilded with spines of poetry books for its reredos yes he probably most likely certainly did that sister ann wondered if i thought he paused i thought not— poetry offered him no solutions at twelve o ’ clock the chairperson called our aa meeting to order we called ourselves “ the loony nooners ” and met in a lutheran church basement we ate salads out of tupperware shaking the contents like dice to mix the dressing some knitted schizophrenics lit multiple cigarettes acne-pocked kate wanted to be a model electroshock mike read paperbacks and an irish professor named tom welcomed tellus who could not get over nam darkened figures in the poor light we looked like the burghers of calais and smelled of brewed coffee smoke perfume urine human brine we were aristocrats of time “ i have twenty-one years ” “ i have one week ” “ i have one day. ” i have often thought we were like first-century christians— a strident hidden throng electrified by a message or another way of thinking of us is that we were inconvenient obstacles momentarily removed much to the city ’ s relief from each window well high heels and business shoes hurried durell h. as he was known to us took his place his thick hair fixed as the waves of an 1800s nautical painting perhaps he kept it set with hair spray his tiffany ring polished to a brilliance he set himself apart in his metal folding chair he had the clotted girth of hermann göring what was he thinking about was he thinking about blood clots and possible aneurysms imperious behind prism-like trifocals quietly he said to me “ i ’ ve grown as fat as elizabeth taylor. ” iii the meeting ended and durell folded his metal chair he hated his christian name— “ durell ” he said “ who names their child durell ” moving among the crowd listening to success and failure he passed out meeting lists literature leaflets durell sponsored men he referred to them as “ pigeons. ” i met him that day i was his last after that every day we spoke on rotary phones i was young and spoke as if my story was the only one i told him i had underlined key passages in plato ’ s symposium told him i had been graded unfairly on dante ’ s inferno and purgatorio told him my schedule might not allow for the paradiso he matched my telling with listening advising and more listening mostly over the phone and the more he listened the more he was alone “ why was that ” sister ann asked it was some sort of offering perhaps at times it seemed he needed to guarantee a pardon that old catholic idea of indulgences lurked somewhere there unspoken as if he believed a larger offering might guarantee a larger pardon such a task demanded his increased singleness yes that was true or was it i had trouble settling on the right words with sister ann many of my words were not exactly right the syntax awkward i kept having trouble translating durell so much i guessed how to know why hadn ’ t i asked him more questions he wasn ’ t the sort that invited questions i do remember that another way of saying it was that when he was with me on the phone then and only then did he seem to move in truth and in his truths reprimanding and hard he was made more singular maybe that was it whatever the case he listened he listened to me i missed his listening listening sister ann said is a memorable form of love after the meeting he gave me his calling card the cards were placed inside his compulsively polished silver card case the black capitals raised on their ecru background containing his name bracketed by a “ mr. ” and a “ jr. ” — the “ mr. ” denoting lost civility the “ jr. ” tallying a lineage that did not bridge as we walked down church street the bells of st. john the evangelist rang the road was bright the road full behind the brown gate with the thick black rusted latch the monks sang “ it is well it is well with my soul with my soul. ” we peered in at bookshop clerks locating titles watch repairmen bent over lit ocular devices fixing movements florists hands wet arranging stems and branches broken we saw ourselves reflected i laughed with deference the way a student laughs before a teacher his skin was flecked with milk-blues lead-whites earthen reds in dress and demeanor he was as rigid as a toy soldier for he was a part of a republic with standards atrophied devoted to order everyone found him impossible including at times me of queers his word for what he was but could not admit to he said “ you know in the army they could never be trusted. ” i mentioned romantic love in profile a silhouette he paused he said “ it has been very vexing indeed. ” by his tone i knew never to ask again a decorum of opprobrium kept him whole and so he guarded himself with intensity maybe sister ann suggested he was guarding me durell said “ i ’ ve whittled my world down to no one spencer with the possible exception of you. ” iv “ what happened then ” sister ann asked he excused himself with a handshake his palms soft as bread dough from all the jergens he had slathered on and then he probably returned to his ambry of a studio a place where i would be one of his only visitors although he handed out his number he did not always answer i remember ... what do i remember ... i was free to turn away but the moment i looked back durell would come back to me waiting for me it seems to me now after all this time few things have as much fidelity as the past i remember he had nailed memorabilia above his head as one would place stones to fortify a castle a photograph of him in the army liberating people undoing russian codes a framed marriage license from england although the marriage failed he often mumbled her name his framed diploma harvard and over the corner hung his graduation cap ’ s faded black tassel next to his pill bottles an edward viii coronation mug he doted on commemorating an event that never took place maybe he made a bread and baloney sandwich maybe he stepped over the rolled-up tag-sale carpet and drew the shades by late evening he might have jotted down notes about god obedient as he was to the twelve steps of aa he might have written in his tightly-looped feminine penmanship informed by the palmer method and later repeated a phrase or two to me over the phone or maybe he read from his twenty-four hours a day book to find a rule maybe or to search for a sanctuary or maybe he listened to the reverend peter gomes on the radio the plummer professor of christian morals at harvard for he often mentioned how he loved the preacher ’ s parallel constructions yes maybe he did that maybe possibly he did that and then perhaps he slept a bit before the whole routine began once more with the support hose the hair spray miss littlefield the sex magazines the grolier the folding chair the meeting the calling card how crazy america was he said how he wanted to leave but he never left town except jolting trips to the hospital in an ambulance down all those brick roads v i lived in cambridge two years after that wherever i moved we spoke daily over the phone on landlines — talking and listening listening and talking for fifteen years “ you alright ” “ yes you ” in all that time i saw him only once more and by then he was nearly blind in all that time we barely touched one another why our relationship required its rood screen i could not fully explain to sister ann indeed i can never seem to properly explain it to anyone but i have tried and i will probably always keep trying but if i get nothing right i must try to get a nuance of our friendship and his sponsorship right— we were bound bound by a vow a vow of attention there are many causes for attention among them redemption our attention concerned the spirit although that sounds pious and we were not so pious we were more selfish more human than pious what else can i say i needed a liberator and liberators can come in some unexpected guises i may never wholly explain the two of us perhaps the spirit defies the human mind even after all my time with sister ann finally from a hospital came the report of durell ’ s last day a charge nurse said “ i touched the gangrene leg pink flesh was coming back. ” his compliments had increased the more his life failed in the final week he quoted cole porter songs to me— you ’ re a bendel bonnet a shakespeare sonnet you ’ re mickey mouse ... i did not repeat the rhymes to sister ann who durell was and why he did what he did and why he hid what he hid i kept asking her sister ann quoted from deuteronomy “ i set before you life and death ... choose life. ” old pigeon flying back when i arrived at the hospital his body was gone the formalities were few for he had become a ward of the state the staff gave me a brown grocery bag of his things a roll of dimes a pair of shoes a belt buckle an einstein quote something about mediocre minds afterwards i went through cambridge and found the meeting gone night was coming blindness worked on the people shops churches streets no one knew me people said “ where will we go ” and “ what will we eat ” i thought i recognized this or that face but no no too much time had passed on church street restaurants had replaced bookstores windows on mass avenue shone with chandeliers someone backed up photographing with a flash “ hold still ” they said “ hold still. ” a new set of homeless people pleaded coins rattled inside the used coffee cups they shook everyone moved with packages briefcases textbooks flash cards cell phones flowers the charles advanced determined as a hearse its dark waters gathering up every unattached thing an umber granular dusk-light fell on the elms over harvard yard as they swayed dark and slow like the chords in the waltz from copeland ’ s rodeo there i stood unsure of which way to go the light had more ghosts in it as it must have had that day in emmaus vi suddenly sister ann announced our last meeting down the linoleum hallway sister katherine and sister ruth moved and prayed their numbers had dropped from seven to six and the nuns decided the retreat house would close soon the chapel and offices would be leveled and replaced with condominiums in the halls the swoosh-snap of duct tape yanked pulled and cut straps tightened vans bleating and backing up into the back weather reports exchanged with the movers sister ann told me about herself that final time parents dead alcoholic brother dead the brother embarrassed she had been a nun she opened her bible on the shipping box between us leaned in her hearing aids on her silver crucifix knocking on her chest above her head a nail where the emmaus scene had hung i asked “ what caused him to remain ” why did he want freedom for me sister ann spoke then of the gospel of john and the samaritan woman at the well the one married nearly as many times as elizabeth taylor and how when christ listened to her she became the first evangelist it was christ ’ s longest conversation with anyone sister ann said the samaritan woman ’ s life changed because christ listened to her john k. from the meetings dead now too once said “ oh i knew durell he was odd but we ’ re all odd you know. ” all i know now is the more he loved me the more i loved the world vii i lost track of sister ann i have often thought about her and all the time she spent with me i have wanted to tell her now for some time that not long after the cloister closed durell ’ s sister located me leaving a message on my answering machine it was still the time of answering machines inviting me to her winter house in boynton beach durell ’ s sister gave me directions she was quite close to me as it turned out she had some of durell ’ s belongings that she wanted me to have “ there isn ’ t much ” she said “ but still i think you should have what ’ s here. ” durell spoke of his sister often but i did not know his family however when we met we recognized each other as one sometimes recognizes what one has never seen before i said to her “ he knew me better than anyone. ” the sentence surprised us we sat by the pool in her gated country club the florida evening was a watercolor in the making colors bleeding into striking mistakes after all the members withdrew she said “ there are many things you do not know about my brother. ” a worker folded terry cloth towels under a bamboo hut her voice halted as voices halt when words have been withheld “ they called him names ” she said “ a nancy boy a priss a sissy a fairy ... ” the pool ’ s tempos ceased until the silence about us was the silence in a palace light disappeared everywhere the sun fell she looked away said that he ’ d been to the army language school learned german and russian played the organ in his spare time mentioned he ’ d taken music with copland at harvard he had received a “ gentleman ’ s ‘ c ’ ” — the “ c ” stood for copland she said he always said— which made us laugh and seemed to beckon him to us he had hoped for an army career she went on and then she mumbled something about a little german town i think she said it was in schleswig-holstein near lübeck where he was stationed while borders were being redrawn the letters stopping the army the men something the drink ... and then her words fell and sank into subtle variations of all that goes unsaid we heard the distant sound of a train on its track crossing the florida map going brown then black he became difficult isolated— she spoke softly then like the penitent he was always asking for money as his requests persisted she began to screen her calls “ it became easier to tell him i had not been home ” she said his behavior was affecting her marriage she chose never to introduce her children to durell perhaps he had a mental illness perhaps he invented— perhaps perhaps perhaps— but no she pressed on perhaps it was his sexuality he was too sensitive ... “ people can be cruel ” she said she felt he had never adjusted to cruelty as if cruelty was something that one needed to adjust to later he was picked up for charges of soliciting sex and the more she told me the less i knew all about us a stillness began to displace the light and durell was there and no longer there staining that stillness after an estrangement ends there comes a great stillness the greater the estrangement the greater the stillness across the parking lot a gate rattled i told her he often said his life had been a failure i tried to convince him otherwise but he never believed me half a century ago she broke off contact her protracted estrangement made her look ill. “ please please ” she said her voice trailed off although what she was pleading for was not clear no no she did not want her grandchildren to know subtle variations of florida evening light withdrew with finality the pool brightened with moonlight the color of snow the pool was still there we were a man and a woman sitting in cushioned lounge chairs as if the world would always be an endless pair of separated things we did not touch each other we were still a long time
i saw you in green velvet wide full sleeves seated in front of a fireplace our house made somehow more gracious and you said “ there are stars in your hair ” — it was truth i brought down with me to this sullen and dingy place that we must make golden make precious and mythical somehow it is our nature and it is truth that we came here i told you from other planets where we were lords we were sent here for some purpose the golden mask i had seen before that fitted so beautifully over your face did not return nor did that face of a bull you had acquired amid northern peoples nomads the gobi desert i did not see those tents again nor the wagons infinitely slow on the infinitely windy plains so cold every star in the sky was a different color the sky itself a tangled tapestry glowing but almost i could see the planet from which we had come i could not remember then what our purpose was but remembered the name mahakala in the dawn in the dawn confronted shiva the cold light revealed the “ mindborn ” worlds as simply that i watched them propagated flowing out or more simply one mirror reflecting another then broke the mirrors you were no longer in sight nor any purpose stared at this new blackness the mindborn worlds fled and the mind turned off a madness or a beginning
besides sundays there were wednesday evenings and the occasional tuesday they called tuesdays “ visitation ” and we would meet in the parking lot and load into a van there were little cards with peoples ’ names and addresses on them and we ’ d drive around until contact was made i always managed to hide a few cards and claimed carsickness but it was too humid to stay in the van oftentimes i ’ d recognize someone from school and felt like apologizing but couldn ’ t on wednesdays it was a bit easier because we arrived early so my mom could volunteer i skated the parking curbs on the side of the building and could hear the choir practice other times i ’ d wait on the stairs at the cosmetology school next door there was this kid who dropped out of eighth grade and i was his lookout while he smoked he preferred to be called fluid and got kicked out of youth group more than once the youth minister was large and pale and wore tight shirts that made sweat stains around his belly one day we went on a retreat that turned out to be a rented trailer in the country in the afternoon we watched films inside and at night played games in the dark i wound up sleeping under a table listening to sanitarium from master of puppets on repeat the following morning my headphones were taken away so i could be open to the message other retreats included all night bowling and friday night lock-up arrival was at ten and they would keep us awake with caffeine sweets and more games i frequently got nervous being separated into groups and remember once winning a race in the foyer wearing high-heels later i escaped to the pews of the sanctuary it was pitch black and i found myself standing in a drained baptismal with white robes hanging over the windows it was strange to see where all those people went after the altar calls those were on sunday mornings and the services were very long and formal it was important to sit behind the older ladies so you could sleep behind their hair after the closing song i ’ d wait in the car seemingly for hours listening to mix tapes mostly suicidal tendencies or maiden then we ’ d drive to a chinese restaurant or go to this pizza place that had a buffet i ’ d watch the others play video games but most of the time i ’ d just go outside the clouds were always cumulus and some afternoons you could hear the wind and think about what it ’ d be like to be somewhere else it really didn ’ t matter though maybe i could get dropped off at a friend ’ s watch kung-fu theater or skate the mini-ramp in the backyard he had twin sisters and we could do whatever we wanted
he is pruning the privet of sickly sorrow desolation in loose pieces of air he goes clip clip clip the green blooming branches fall— ‘ they ’ re getting out of hand ’ delirious and adorable what a switch we perceive multiple identities when you sing so beautifully the shifting clouds you are not alone is this world not a lone a parallel world of reflection in a window keeps the fire burning in the framed mandala the red shafted flicker sits on the back of the garden chair in the rain the red robed monks downtown in the rain a rainbow arises simple country practices thunder lightning hail and rain eight douglas iris ribbon layers of attention so constant creation of ‘ self ’ is a tricky mess he is pruning the loquat the olive which looks real enough in the damp late morning air may 15 1995
the grasses are light brown and the ocean comes in long shimmering lines under the fleet from last night which dozes now in the early morning here and there horses graze on somebody ’ s acreage strangely it was not my desire that bade me speak in church to be released but memory of the way it used to be in careless and exotic play when characters were promises then recognitions the world of transformation is real and not real but trusting enough of these lessons i mean didactic phrases to take you in and out of love ’ s mysterious bonds well i myself am not myself and which power of survival i speak for is not made of houses it is inner luxury of golden figures that breathe like mountains do and whose skin is made dusky by stars
night the fat serpent slipped among the plants intent upon the apples of his eyes a heavy bandoleer hung like a prize around his neck and tropical red ants mounted his body and he heard advance little by little the thin female cries of mortar shells he thought of paradise such is the vision that extremity grants in the clean brightness of magnesium flares there were seven angels by a tree their hair flashed diamonds and they made him doubt they were not really from elysium and his flesh opened like a peony red at the heart white petals furling out
i would invoke that man who chipped for all posterity an ass the one that jesus rode out of hard stone and set its either wing among the wings of the most saintly clan on chartres cathedral and that it might sing the praise to all who pass of its unearthly load hung from its neck a harp-like instrument i would invoke that man to aid my argument the ass smiles on us all being astonished that an ass might rise to such sure eminence not merely among asses but mankind simpers almost upon the western wall in praise of folly who midst sow and kine saw with its foolish eyes gold myrrh and frankincense enter the stable door against all odds the ass smiles on us all our butt at last is god ’ s that man is but an ass— more perfectly that ass is but a man who struggles to describe our rich contingent and substantial world in ideal signs the dunged and pagan grass misted in summer or the mother-of-pearled home of the bachelor-clam a cold and toothless tribe has he for brothers who would coldly think that man is but an ass who smells not his own stink for all his abstract style speaks not to our humanity and shows neither the purity of heaven nor the impurity beneath and can not see the feasted crocodile ringed with st. francis ’ birds to pick its teeth nor can his thought disclose to normal intimacy siamese twins the double-beasted back for all his abstract style utters our chiefest lack despite his abstract style pickerel will dawdle in their summer pools lit by the flitterings of light dashing the gusty surfaces or lie suspended among shades of bile and lime in fluent shift for all he says and all the grey-haired mules simple and neuter things will bray hosannas blessing harp and wing for all his abstract style the ass will learn to sing
i hunted heaven for him no dice too uppity it was not enough music or dark dirt i begged the earth empty of him death believes in us whether we believe or not for a long while i watch the sound of a boy bouncing a ball down the block take its time to reach me father find me when you want i ’ ll wait
god put his finger on my sacrum and he lifted me he set me in the center of the universe the curious desire of my chronically lonely life it was cold and dark and lonely and i was scared there were no accessories i burst into tears over nothing what would jimmy schuyler do wwjsd and as quietly as the sound of kleenex being pulled from a box i sneezed and morning that goddess as if she were slightly deaf barely lifted her head off the horizon before laying back down and a rose opened her portals and the scent ran up an elephant ’ s trunk or tried to such a long way for everything to travel from here i look like a front moving in an icy purple light a poet would say belonged to a perfume stopper belonging to his mother when it was her nipple you know neither in the past or in the future
there are these trees and beyond these trees trees and beyond that little or nothing little fields and nothing but sky

for it was the first day of rosh ha'shanah new year 's day day of remembrance of ancient sacrifices and averted calamities for i started the day by eating an apple dipped in honey as ritual required for i went to the local synagogue to listen to the ram 's horn blown for i asked our father our king to save us for his sake if not for ours for the sake of his abundant mercies for the sake of his right hand for the sake of those who went through fire and water for the sanctification of his name for despite the use of a microphone and other gross violations of ceremony i gave myself up gladly to the synagogue 's sensual insatiable vast womb for what right have i to feel offended for i communed with my dead father and a conspicuous tear rolled down my right cheek and there was loud crying inside me for i understood how that tear could become an orb for the hebrew melodies comforted me for i lost my voice for i met a friend who asked `` is this a day of high seriousness '' and when i said yes he said `` it has taken your voice away '' for he was right for i felt the strong lashes of the wind lashing me by the throat for i thought there shall come a day that the watchmen upon the hills of ephraim shall cry arise and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god for the virgin shall rejoice in the dance and the young and old in each other 's arms and their soul shall be as a watered garden and neither shall they learn war any more for god shall lower the price of bread and corn and wine and oil he shall let our cry come up to him for it is customary on the first day of rosh ha'shanah to cast a stone into the depths of the sea to weep and pray to weep no more for the stone represents all the sins of the people for i asked you and molly to accompany me to cascadilla creek there being no ocean nearby for we talked about the psalms of david along the way and the story of hannah mother of samuel who sought the most robust bard to remedy her barrenness for isaac said `` i see the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the offering '' for as soon as i saw the stone white flat oblong and heavy i knew that it had summoned me for i heard the voice locked inside that stone for i pictured a dry wilderness in which with a wave of my staff i could command sweet waters to flow forth from that stone for i cast the stone into the stream and watched it sink to the bottom where dozens of smaller stones all of them black gathered around it for the waterfall performed the function of the chorus for after the moment of solemnity dissolved you playfully tossed molly into the stream for you tossed her three times and three times she swam back for her life for she shook the water off her body refreshed for you removed the leash from her neck and let her roam freely for she darted off into the brush and speared a small gray moving thing in the neck for this was the work of an instant for we looked and behold the small gray thing was a rat for molly had killed the rat with a single efficient bite in conformance with jewish law for i took the rat and cast him into the stream and both of us congratulated molly for now she resumed her noble gait for she does not lie awake in the dark and weep for her sins and whine about her condition and discuss her duty to god for i 'd as lief pray with your dog molly as with any man for she knows that god is her savior

our islands are tagaloaalagi ’ s stepping stones across le vasa loloa small and frail but courageous enough to bear his weight and mana high enough to keep us above the drowning and learning how to navigate by the stars currents and the ferocity of storms point and sail in any direction as long as you know how to return home you have to navigate the space between the borders of your skin and the intelligence of the tongueless horizon and learn the language of touch of signs and pain of what isn ’ t and what may be in the circle of the tides that will stretch until you understand the permanent silence at the end of your voyage and our islands are your anchor and launching site for the universes that repeat and repeat like the long waves of our ocean like tagaloaalagi ’ s compulsive scrutiny of what is to come and fear
our fathers did but use the world before and having used did leave the same to us we spill whatever resteth to their store what can our heirs inherit but our curse for we have sucked the sweet and sap away and sowed consumption in the fruitful ground the woods and forests clad in rich array with nakedness and baldness we confound we have defaced the lasting monuments and caused all honour to have end with us the holy temples feel our ravishments what can our heirs inherit but our curse the world must end for men are so accurst unless god end it sooner they will first

if i were in a book it would be the book in which some lesser angel bemoans the state of my soul and is comforted for it and is corrected for it by some greater angel who knows as the reader knows that it is not one ’ s soul that suffers the indignities of ignobility the inability to curb the petty smallness of spirit ungladness in the company of bureaucrats anger ’ s decay in the sense that my soul itself can not be harmed nor tarnished though it can witness my sorrow on finding that illness alters me from the self i thought i ’ d more or less known what can one do about one ’ s nature i look at the spider that ’ s finally restrung its great wheel away from the door i ’ d like to close the door go away leaving the spider be i ’ d like to preclude the possibility of angel as of prey
and if sun comes how shall we greet him shall we not dread him shall we not fear him after so lengthy a session with shade though we have wept for him though we have prayed all through the night-years— what if we wake one shimmering morning to hear the fierce hammering of his firm knuckles hard on the door shall we not shudder — shall we not flee into the shelter the dear thick shelter of the familiar propitious haze sweet is it sweet is it to sleep in the coolness of snug unawareness the dark hangs heavily over the eyes
i spoke in a hurry in a nervous hush because the time was short— the lightning was shuddering slowing down running or was that my blood the quiet diminishing of daily life it ’ s time for me to go forth into your tiny mustard seed in the house of my father everything is fading in the house of the father all the angels are crying because the anguish of a jaded exhausted horse sometimes finds its way even unto them one gray day i was alive on this earth and amid the mist of day—in triumph— the spirit may approach and look so that you will see him without seeing and so celebrate the meager light curse not the twilight if christ is to visit us it will be on such pitiful days as these

pomegranates fell from the trees in our sleep if we stayed in the sun too long there were aloes to cool the burn henbane for predators and succulents when the rain was scarce there was no glorified past to point the way true and natural for the sexes to meet he kept looking to the heavens as if the answer were anywhere but here i was so bored with our goodness i couldn ’ t suck the juice from one more pear it ’ s here i kept telling him here rooted in the soil like every other tree you know and i wove us a bed of its uppermost branches
i know if i find you i will have to leave the earth and go on out over the sea marshes and the brant in bays and over the hills of tall hickory and over the crater lakes and canyons and on up through the spheres of diminishing air past the blackset noctilucent clouds where one wants to stop and look way past all the light diffusions and bombardments up farther than the loss of sight into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark and i know if i find you i will have to stay with the earth inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest coelenterates and praying for a nerve cell with all the soul of my chemical reactions and going right on down where the eye sees only traces you are everywhere partial and entire you are on the inside of everything and on the outside i walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut and i see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down and if i find you i must go out deep into your far resolutions and if i find you i must stay here with the separate leaves
1. let us think of god as a lover who never calls whose pleasure in us is aroused in unrepeatable ways god as a body we can not separate from desire saying to us “ your love is only physical. ” let us think of god as a bronze with green skin or a plane that draws the eye close to the texture of paint let us think of god as life a bacillus or virus as death an igneous rock in a quartz garden then let us think of kissing god with the kisses of our mouths of lying with god as sea worms lie snugly petrifying in their coral shirts let us think of ourselves as part of god neither alive nor dead but like alpha omega glyphs and hieroglyphs numbers data 2. first forgive the silence that answers prayer then forgive the prayer that stains the silence excuse the absence that feels like presence then excuse the feeling that insists on presence pardon the delay of revelation then ask pardon for revealing your impatience forgive god for being only a word then ask god to forgive the betrayal of language 3. god of the syllable god of the word god who speaks to us god who is dumb the one god the many god the unnameable god of the human face god of the mask god of the gene pool microbe mineral god of the sparrow ’ s fall god of the spark god of the act of god blameless jealous god of surprises and startling joy god who is absent god who is present god who finds us in our hiding places god whom we thank whom we forget to thank father god mother inhuman infant cosmic chthonic god of the nucleus dead god living god alpha god zed god whom we name god whom we can not name when we open our mouths with the name god word god 4. the new day cancels dread and dawn forgives all sins all the judgments of insomnia as if they were only dreams the ugly confrontation after midnight with the mirror turns white around the edges and burns away like frost daylight undoes gravity and lightness responds to the light the new day lifts all weight like stepping off into space where is that room you woke to by clock-light at 3 a.m. nightmare ’ s many mansions falling have taken it with them the new day the day ’ s newness and the wretchedness that you thought would never never depart meet—and there is goodbye a bad night lies ahead and a new day beyond that— a simple sequence but hard to remember in the right order 5. lord of dimensions and the dimensionless wave and particle all and none who lets us measure the wounded atom who lets us doubt all measurement when in this world we betray you let us be faithful in another
someone spoke to me last night told me the truth just a few words but i recognized it i knew i should make myself get up write it down but it was late and i was exhausted from working all day in the garden moving rocks now i remember only the flavor — not like food sweet or sharp more like a fine powder like dust and i wasn ’ ﻿t elated or frightened but simply rapt aware that ’ ﻿s how it is sometimes — god comes to your window all bright light and black wings and you ’ ﻿re just too tired to open it
tell us how the soul is bound and bentinto these knots and whether any ever frees itself from such imprisonment —canto xii inferno i say without a god there is no hell there ’ s only this— she rustles for her keys the apple tree sheds petal after petal she says let ’ s take you to the hospital the petals spin like sparks i close my eyes and say without a god there is no hell and there is only this it ’ s just as well the lawn is red and white she asks who says how do you know the wind fells every petal she says let ’ s take you to the hospital i can not breathe i can not tell her yes— because without a god there is no hell as she whispers talk to me i know i will clamber—but not toward heaven toward the sky eyes winking behind petal after petal the rope-burnt bark will flake away and fall knot on my neck the rest would be so easy i ’ ll pray without a god there is no hell then slip through petals—through petal after petal
growing up i barely knew the bible but read and reread the part when cain drifted east or was drawn that way into a place of desolation the land of nod there to begin with a wife of unknown origin another race of men under the mark of god as a boy i thought nod would be a place where the blue scillas would bloom gray a country of the rack and screw the serrated sword where the very serving cups were bone as a grown man i ’ ve heard that nod never was a nation—of cain ’ s offspring or anyone— but a mistranslation of “ wander ” so cain could go wherever and be in nod far more than in god i believe in cain who destroyed his own brother and therefore in any city could have his wish and be alone
one does not want o lord to heap up by still waters of words a cairn but hopes to attend a small covert of tamarisk whose leaves salty yet feathery will shed light over a thickened plot one wants at last to cede the field to tamarisk and mastic tree to olive and stone stones in the fruit seed in the stones
lauds somehow i am sturdier more shore than sea-spray as i thicken through the bedroom door i gleam of sickness you give me morning lord as you give earthquake to all architecture i can forget you put that sugar in the melon ’ s breath and it is wet with what you are i too ferment you rub the hum and simple warmth of summer from afar into the hips of insects and of everything i can forget and like the sea one more machine without a memory i don ’ t believe that you made me prime i don ’ t believe that you made me into this tremolo of hands this fever this flat-footed dance of tendons and the drapery of skin along a skeleton i am that i am a brittle rib cage and the hummingbird of breath that flickers in it incrementally i stand in me are eons and the cramp of endless ancestry sun is in the leaves again i think i see you in the wind but then i think i see the wind

it ’ s the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me that drives us like lemmings but cautiously— the search for a bright square cloud—the scent of lemon verbena— or to learn rules for the game the sea otters play in the surf it is these small things—and the secret behind them that fill the heart the pattern the spirit the fiery demon that link them together and pull their freedom into our senses the smell of a shrub a cloud the action of animals —the rising the exuberance when the mystery is unveiled it is these small things that when brought into vision become an inferno

a tree that grew in the garden of eden a tree of innocence called the tree of good and evil it was harmless as opposites are in balance it was also tasteless the taste of innocence before it is betrayed when god removed the wall he gave the lemon thorns and bitterness because it had no hostility it is a taste we want most to subdue it asks to be left alone we use it with fish and tea we sugar it look out the window it stands with a donkey ’ s stance hoping the day will pass its scent through the curtains cuts through mustiness sharp with sweet blossoms it hides the smell of new babies

a true friend is one soul in two bodies —aristotle kant says transcendental idealism in aquinas we exist apart from bodies but only on thursdays when his famous ox flies by the window wiser at cologne where albertus magnus his real name appoints aquinas to magister studentium master of students aquinas is petrified but says yes he feels his soul sailing out of his head floating near the roof where a blue ox wings by on wednesday two bodies are one soul waking at sunrise thanks to the pineal gland of descartes who thinks this node in the brain is a tiny sugar cone or salted peanut the seat of the soul while aristotle points to the chopping ax as a teleology as if the ax were a living breathing person which it isn ’ t heraclitus air and fire while aquinas objects no not an ax but ox if you ’ re a bird or soul i am only one mile from the sea if you are a soul in two bodies life is more complex and we must labor twice the field of sorrow after sleep bath and a glass as aquinas whispers the things we love tell us who we are
my father had a steel comb with which he would comb our hair after a bath the cold metal soothing against my scalp his hand cupping my chin my mother had a red pullover with a little yellow duck embroidered on it and a pendant made from a gold victoria coronation coin which later when we first moved to buffalo would be stolen from the house the sunn ’ i muslims have a story in which the angels cast a dark mark out of prophet mohammad ’ s heart thus making him pure though the shi ’ a reject this story believing in his absolute innocence from birth telling the famous story of the blanket in which the prophet covers himself with a yemeni blanket for his afternoon rest joined under the blanket first by his son-in-law ali then each of his grandchildren hassan and hussain and finally by his daughter bibi fatima in heaven gabriel asks god about the five under the blanket and god says those are the five people whom i loved the most out of all creation and i made everything in the heavens and the earth for their sake gabriel speaker on god ’ s behalf whisperer to prophets asks god can i go down and be the sixth among them and god says go down there and ask them if they consent you may go under the blanket and be the sixth among them creation for the sake of gabriel is retroactively granted when the group under the blanket admits him to their company is that me at the edge of the blanket asking to be allowed inside asking the 800 hadith be canceled all history re-ordered in hyderabad i prayed every part of the day climbed a thousand steps to the site of maula ali ’ s pilgrimage i wanted to be those stairs the hunger i felt the river inside i learned to pronounce my daily prayers from transliterated english in a book called “ know your islam ” dark blue with gold calligraphed writing that made the english appear as if it were arabic complete with marks above and below the letters i didn ’ t learn the arabic script until years later and never learned the language itself god ’ s true language hebrew latin arabic sanskrit as if utterance fit into the requirements of the human mouth i learned how to find the new moon by looking for the circular absence of stars when abraham took isaac up into the thicket his son did not know where he was being led when his father bound him and took up the knife he was shocked and said “ father where is the ram ” though from abraham ’ s perspective he was asked by god to sacrifice his son and proved his love by taking up the knife thinking to himself perhaps oh ismail ismail do i cut or do i burn i learned god ’ s true language is only silence and breath fourth son of a fourth son my father was afflicted as a child and as was the custom in those days a new name was selected for him to protect his health still the feeling of his rough hand gently cupping my cheek dipping the steel comb in water to comb my hair flat my hair was kept so short combed flat when wet i never knew my hair was wavy until i was nearly twenty-two and never went outside with wet and uncombed hair until i was twenty-eight at which point i realized my hair was curly my father ’ s hands have fortune-lines in them cut deeply and dramatic the day i left his house for the last time i asked him if i could hold his hand before i left there are two different ways of going about this if you have known this for years why didn ’ t you ask for help he asked me each time i left home including the last time my mother would hold a quran up for me to walk under once under one would turn and kiss the book there is no place in the quran which requires acts of homosexuality to be punishable by lashings and death hadith or scripture scripture or rupture should i travel out from under the blanket comfort from a verse which also recurs “ surely there are signs in this for those of you who would reflect. ” or the one hundred and four books of god of which only four are known—qur ’ an injeel tavrat zubuur there are a hundred others—bhagavad-gita lotus sutra song of myself the gospel of magdalene popul vuh the book of black buffalo woman—somewhere unrevealed as such dear mother in the sky you could unbuckle the book and erase all the annotations what i always remember about my childhood is my mother whispering to me telling me secrets ideas suggestions she named me when i moved in her while she was reading a calligraphy of the imam ’ s names my name translated my whole life for me as patience in india we climbed the steps of the maula ali mountain to the top thirsting for what my mother had stayed behind in the house unable to go on pilgrimage she had told me the reason why being in a state considered unacceptable for prayers or pilgrimages i asked if she would want more children and she told me the name she would give a new son i always attribute the fact that they did not though my eldest sister ’ s first son was given the same name she whispered to me that afternoon to my telling of her secret to my sisters when we were climbing the stairs it is the one betrayal of her—perhaps meaningless—that i have never forgiven myself there are secrets it is still hard to tell betrayals hard to make you hope like anything that though others consider you unclean god will still welcome you my name is kazim which means patience i know how to wait
the rain whistled a taxi brought me to your apartment building and there i stood i had dreamed a dream of us in a bedroom the light shining upon us in white sheets you were singing me a song of your sailing days and in the dream i reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal which in bright red flew out the window sometimes when we talk on the phone i think to myself that the deep perfect of your soul is what draws me to you but still what soul is perfect all souls are misshapen and off-colored morning comes within a soul and makes it obey another law in which all souls are snowflakes once at a funeral a man had died and with the prayers said his soul flew up in a hurry like it had been let out of something awful it was strangely colored that soul and it was a funny shape and a funny temperature as it blew away all of us looking felt the cold
the man who murders his wife is not the same as the man who goes around and murders a stranger i am a woman but i am not the same as another woman identity politics are bullshit there is only the smart and the evil the good and the righteous there is only one color on the earth in its infinite degradations it becomes music and mathematics there is shit on my hands when i have been playing around with specifics love your lover you are a lover with each breath god has put a golden faith upon the snowy mountains of the world here look at the snowy mountains glittering with snow they are wiser than you might think and in your soul the small grey animals of the world sit and wait to do good for you and together we are one thing bleating a somber scurrying lullaby to lapsing pinkish angels upon a mountain the angels smile sleepily as they stretch their very long legs thinking of us and wise they might seem us and the angels but really it is only god who is wise

the body of the boy who took his flight off the cliff at kilcloher into the sea was hauled up by curragh-men out at first light fishing mackerel in the estuary “ no requiem or rosary ” said the priest “ nor consecrated ground for burial ” as if the boy had flown outside the pale of mercy or redemption or god ’ s love “ forgive them for they know not what they do ” quoth argyle to the corpse ’ s people who heard in what he said a sort of riddle as if he meant their coreligionists and not their sodden sadly broken boy either way they took some comfort in it and readied better than accustomed fare of food and spirits by their own reckoning the greater sin the greater so the toll but argyle refused their shilling coin and helped them build a box and dig a grave “ your boy ’ s no profligate or prodigal ” he said “ only a wounded pilgrim like us all what say his leaping was a leap of faith into his father ’ s beckoning embrace ” they killed no fatted calf they filled the hole
as the dead prey upon us they are the dead in ourselves awake my sleeping ones i cry out to you disentangle the nets of being i pushed my car it had been sitting so long unused i thought the tires looked as though they only needed air but suddenly the huge underbody was above me and the rear tires were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together as were the dead souls in the living room gathered about my mother some of them taking care to pass beneath the beam of the movie projector some record playing on the victrola and all of them desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell i turned to the young man on my right and asked “ how is it there ” and he begged me protestingly don ’ t ask we are poor poor and the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations of brake linings and other automotive accessories cardboard displays the dead roaming from one to another as bored back in life as they are in hell poor and doomed to mere equipments my mother as alive as ever she was asleep when i entered the house as i often found her in a rocker under the lamp and awaking as i came up to her as she ever had i found out she returns to the house once a week and with her the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death as other like suited and dressed people did in life o the dead and the indian woman and i enabled the blue deer to walk and the blue deer talked in the next room a negro talk it was like walking a jackass and its talk was the pressing gabber of gammers of old women and we helped walk it around the room because it was seeking socks or shoes for its hooves now that it was acquiring human possibilities in the five hindrances men and angels stay caught in the net in the immense nets which spread out across each plane of being the multiple nets which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels and the demons and men go up and down walk the jackass hear the victrola let the automobile be tucked into a corner of the white fence when it is a white chair purity is only an instant of being the trammels recur in the five hindrances perfection is hidden i shall get to the place 10 minutes late it will be 20 minutes of 9. and i don ’ t know without the car how i shall get there o peace my mother i do not know how differently i could have done what i did or did not do that you are back each week that you fall asleep with your face to the right that you are present there when i come in as you were when you were alive that you are as solid and your flesh is as i knew it that you have the company i am used to your having but o that you all find it such a cheapness o peace mother for the mammothness of the comings and goings of the ladders of life the nets we are entangled in awake my soul let the power into the last wrinkle of being let none of the threads and rubber of the tires be left upon the earth let even your mother go let there be only paradise the desperateness is that the instant which is also paradise paradise is happiness dissolves into the next instant and power flows to meet the next occurrence is it any wonder my mother comes back do not that throng rightly seek the room where they might expect happiness they did not complain of life they obviously wanted the movie each other merely to pass among each other there where the real is even to the display cards to be out of hell the poverty of hell o souls in life and in death make even as you sleep even in sleep know what wind even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile lifts it away clears the sodden weights of goods equipment entertainment the foods the indian woman the filthy blue deer the 4 by 3 foot ‘ viewbook ’ the heaviness of the old house the stuffed inner room lifts the sodden nets and they disappear as ghosts do as spider webs nothing before the hand of man the vent you must have the vent or you shall die which means never to die the ghastliness of going and forever coming back returning to the instants which were not lived o mother this i could not have done i could not have lived what you didn ’ t i am myself netted in my own being i want to die i want to make that instant too perfect o my soul slip the cog ii the death in life death itself is endless eternity is the false cause the knot is other wise each topological corner presents itself and no sword cuts it each knot is itself its fire each knot of which the net is made is for the hands to untake the knot ’ s making and touch alone can turn the knot into its own flame o mother if you had once touched me o mother if i had once touched you the car did not burn its underside was not presented to me a grotesque corpse the old man merely removed it as i looked up at it and put it in a corner of the picket fence like was it my mother ’ s white dog or a child ’ s chair the woman playing on the grass with her son the woman next door was angry with me whatever it was slipped across the playpen or whatever she had out there on the grass and i was quite flip in reply that anyone who used plastic had to expect things to skid and break that i couldn ’ t worry that her son might have been hurt by whatever it was i sent skidding down on them it was just then i went into my house and to my utter astonishment found my mother sitting there as she always had sat as must she always forever sit there her head lolling into sleep awake awake my mother what wind will lift you too forever from the tawdriness make you rich as all those souls crave crave crave to be rich they are right we must have what we want we can not afford not to we have only one course the nets which entangle us are flames o souls burn alive burn now that you may forever have peace have what you crave o souls go into everything let not one knot pass through your fingers let not any they tell you you must sleep as the net comes through your authentic hands what passes is what is what shall be what has been what hell and heaven is is earth to be rent to shoot you through the screen of flame which each knot hides as all knots are a wall ready to be shot open by you the nets of being are only eternal if you sleep as your hands ought to be busy method method i too call on you to come to the aid of all men to women most who know most to woman to tell men to awake awake men awake i ask my mother to sleep i ask her to stay in the chair my chair is in the corner of the fence she sits by the fireplace made of paving stones the blue deer need not trouble either of us and if she sits in happiness the souls who trouble her and me will also rest the automobile has been hauled away
the street is empty as a monk ’ s memory and faces explode in the flames like acorns— and the dead crowd the horizon and doorways no vein can bleed more than it already has no scream will rise higher than it ’ s already risen we will not leave everyone outside is waiting for the trucks and the cars loaded with honey and hostages we will not leave the shields of light are breaking apart before the rout and the siege outside everyone wants us to leave but we will not leave ivory white brides behind their veils slowly walk in captivity ’ s glare waiting and everyone outside wants us to leave but we will not leave the big guns pound the jujube groves destroying the dreams of the violets extinguishing bread killing the salt unleashing thirst and parching lips and souls and everyone outside is saying “ what are we waiting for warmth we ’ re denied the air itself has been seized why aren ’ t we leaving ” masks fill the pulpits and brothels the places of ablution masks cross-eyed with utter amazement they do not believe what is now so clear and fall astonished writhing like worms or tongues we will not leave are we in the inside only to leave leaving is just for the masks for pulpits and conventions leaving is just for the siege-that-comes-from-within the siege that comes from the bedouin ’ s loins the siege of the brethren tarnished by the taste of the blade and the stink of crows we will not leave outside they ’ re blocking the exits and offering their blessings to the impostor praying petitioning almighty god for our deaths 5.11.1983
i drew solitude over me on the long shore —robinson jeffers “ prelude ” for whoever does not afflict his soul through this day shall be cut off from his people —leviticus 23:29 what is a jew in solitude what would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid far from your own or those you have called your own what is a woman in solitude a queer woman or man in the empty street on the empty beach in the desert what in this world as it is can solitude mean the glassy concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs with its electric gate its perfected privacy is not what i mean the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in utah or the golan heights is not what i mean the poet ’ s tower facing the western ocean acres of forest planted to the east the woman reading in the cabin her attack dog suddenly risen is not what i mean three thousand miles from what i once called home i open a book searching for some lines i remember about flowers something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once bound me back there—yes lupines on a burnt mountainside something that bloomed and faded and was written down in the poet ’ s book forever opening the poet ’ s book i find the hatred in the poet ’ s heart the hateful-eyed and human-bodied are all about me you that love multitude may have them robinson jeffers multitude is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys and the farms that run down to the sea the lupines are multitude and the torched poppies the grey pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf and the separate persons stooped over sewing machines in denim dust bent under the shattering skies of harvest who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams hands that pick pack steam stitch strip stuff shell scrape scour belong to a brain like no other must i argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights the survivalist ’ s final solution have i a choice to wonder far from your own or those you have called your own to hear strangeness calling you from far away and walk in that direction long and far not calculating risk to go to meet the stranger without fear or weapon protection nowhere on your mind the jew on the icy rutted road on christmas eve prays for another jew the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street make those be a woman ’ s footsteps as if she could believe in a woman ’ s god find someone like yourself find others agree you will never desert each other understand that any rift among you means power to those who want to do you in close to the center safety toward the edges danger but i have a nightmare to tell i am trying to say that to be with my people is my dearest wish but that i also love strangers that i crave separateness i hear myself stuttering these words to my worst friends and my best enemies who watch for my mistakes in grammar my mistakes in love this is the day of atonement but do my people forgive me if a cloud knew loneliness and fear i would be that cloud to love the stranger to love solitude—am i writing merely about privilege about drifting from the center drawn to edges a privilege we can ’ t afford in the world that is who are hated as being of our kind faggot kicked into the icy river woman dragged from her stalled car into the mist-struck mountains used and hacked to death young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk his prizes and studies nothing nothing availing his blackness jew deluded that she ’ s escaped the tribe the laws of her exclusion the men too holy to touch her hand jew who has turned her back on midrash and mitzvah yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts hiking alone found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs did she die as queer or as jew solitude o taboo endangered species on the mist-struck spur of the mountain i want a gun to defend you in the desert on the deserted street i want what i can ’ t have your elder sister justice her great peasant ’ s hand outspread her eye half-hooded sharp and true and i ask myself have i thrown courage away have i traded off something i don ’ t name to what extreme will i go to meet the extremist what will i do to defend my want or anyone ’ s want to search for her spirit-vision far from the protection of those she has called her own will i find o solitude your plumes your breasts your hair against my face as in childhood your voice like the mockingbird ’ s singing yes you are loved why else this song in the old places anywhere what is a jew in solitude what is a woman in solitude a queer woman or man when the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock crumble the prophet ’ s headland and the farms slide into the sea when leviathan is endangered and jonah becomes revenger when center and edges are crushed together the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded when our souls crash together arab and jew howling our loneliness within the tribes when the refugee child and the exile ’ s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered tell our stories of

here where god lives among the trees where birds and monks the whole day sing his praises in a pleasant ease o heart might we not find a home here after all our wandering these gates are closed even on rome souls of the twilight wander here here in the garden of that death which was for love 's sake need we fear how sharp with bitter joy might be love 's lingering last longed-for breath shut in upon eternity
at the mouth of the river moon stars an arctic calm the twin lights at the end of the piers revolving with the smoothness we expect of supernatural machinery seen from down here on the beach the harbored ocean slowly tilts like a mirror discreetly manhandled by night from the giant room it was supposed to occupy forever the mind says now but the stars on their angelic gimbals roll and fade a tide of constellations breaking nowhere every night about this time strike up the band in the tumbledown bar the singer has fallen from stardom and grace but though her interests nowadays are wholly secular she can still refer back to the angels and knowing that song we share a moment with the saved before we leave to make the crossing no captain no ferry but cross we shall believe you me

how struck i was by that face years ago in the church mural eve being led by christ through the broken gates of hell she ’ s been nominated for the position of featured saint on the icon of belief up against the dark horse candidate— me fever-ridden and delirious a child in vellore unfolding the packet around my neck that i was ordered not to open inside a folk cure painted delicately in saffron letters that i could not read why i feel qualified for the position based on letters i could not read amounts to this neither you nor i can pronounce the difference between the broken gates and the forbidden letters so what reason do we need to believe in icons or saints how might we otherwise remember— without an image to fasten in that lonely place— the rock on which a prophet flung himself into fever without an icon or church spell “ gates of hell. ” spell “ those years ago unfolding. ” recite to me please all the letters you are not able to read spell “ fling yourself skyward. ” spell “ fever ”

beauty is my irreparable and today i became geometric a faux linear figure that distills a skip trace of first principles in a whiteout of atlantic snow banging stars into the femoral vein of euclid while rows of lavender circuits all porous surrounded me i genuflected before the hospital parking of my father ’ s jaundice for i am a good daughter of the colony the colony which begot the immortal heart of the markets resource nursed all young bucks of the florets a liquidity i should service or else receive a lesser dessert with my smudge cleanse at the ready i find myself dispensing with the usual future haunt of stability a survival signaling my relationship to time or i ’ m out of it entirely chanting hell as hair veils my face as if this is a western come polygon and i circumvent the disaster do not disturb my circles holy i went holy all around my head the holy i am went careening down the back stairs of this low-rise rental striated by the pinnacle light of this city that has my blood pooled purple at the center of its gravity you can scan the ground from overhead for death pits i read this on the internet when i was dehydrated lonely and afraid office plants all broad-leafed repositories for cognition ’ s patent heart i ’ ve gone and been abominable a column extended from the top of my head into heaven at the edges of my system an anishinabek or indo-european projection of words my nerves could translate into the crawl space of animal magnetism white pine verticals send us up as a stomach pumped by filial love oh inconsequent curb of my street i refuse to kneel this day like any other a cousin charged with trafficking still waiting to be ordained i make mask of our features that are retreating plush pockets of rust about another falsehood of water a creek that pleats i ’ ve gone and got a blister that summer a black bear ’ s muzzle was coated in shellac from the aerosol can she bit through on my mother ’ s porch a half-century after my grandmother ’ s mother said don ’ t ever shoot a black bear they are my people so i continue to speak more than this mortuary sunrise where i am only just alive boozhoo today is over
i was hanging with grandparents in a kindergarten and the teacher drew an accordion wall across to keep the children in antigravity class together the grandparents separately graded balloon worksheets sunlight floated in the grandparents thoughtful about addition mulling vacation come here i said to the little one too little to be in class soft as peaches i want to tell you something and you repeat it back to me next time she toddled over put her arms up to hug me we hugged she had stars inside her soul was visibly celestial beneath her coat more human than human got it i cuddled her okay she said i ’ m more human than a human
do i have to dress up or can i wear jeans dear joaquin casual sunday is a plus can a woman be fully present in heels remember the other day at the shops we saw the t-shirt that read “ blessed ” across the front i know you picked it up for me as a joke but it made me pause i think i am blessed in the way i understand people to mean it having good fortune but this is where faith messes with my clean concept because practicing christians don ’ t believe blessings come out the clear blue sky so here ’ s god again all up in the kool-aid i ’ m dating myself but i mean that he gets in the way of spiritual minimalism he is at once contained and uncontainable which intellectually is hard to understand so being blessed must require that one acts in such a way that presses god to bestow blessings which isn ’ t the same thing as good fortune but i want to believe that people are saying “ you have such good fortune i hope for good fortune too ” because it means that no one is preaching at me like “ you have good god-god ” “ father god i hope he gods for us too ” “ you got god ” et cetera
when god appears before me he is a burning woman tied to a bush her nakedness a missed spot on a busy canvas where a male hand has been practicing female gestures for instance hanging herself like laundry over her own arm nipple-colons introduce this scene of medieval war horses crowned with riders are leaving horses ’ tails like a clock ’ s hands whip flies of hours off their round thighs time is an insect that leaves its maggots to hatch on an open wound of a mammal there ’ s more face on these thighs than on all of the women ’ s bodies one with an arrow aimed at her hands on her bent knees as if she wanted to ski into death like a scared child mocks the splendid horse tails with hair so red all of her blood must have gone into it so it isn ’ t a bush on fire it ’ s red hair she used as a shield in the distance a town burning impatiently horses whip buzzing ashes the end
not an answer she leaned into the apple tree which then was evergreen to the snake ’ s hands sweet flesh no need to be ashamed we share and share alike the peel not loose like night on day but tight she took the snake ’ s hands diamondbacked and opened its question it was the first time she had something to give what the man couldn ’ t take the first time the man said please please let me have a bite he found the iron ore and brought it home he found the coal under the forest and lit it on fire to watch it go so the snake couldn ’ t catch her if she fell and she couldn ’ t hold anything but its tongue never let the fire go out or else he warned and she held on

it doesn ’ t matter a damn what ’ s playing— in the dead of winter you go days of 1978— 79 and we went because the soldiers were beautiful and doomed as asian jungles kept afire christ-like in the hopeless war i did not go to in the end because it ended the 20th century it was a war between peasants on the one side hallucinations on the other a peasant is a fire that burns but is not consumed his movie never ends it will be beautiful every winter of our lives my love as christ crushes fire into his wounds and the wounds are a jungle equally no matter when their movies end hallucinations destroy the destroyers that ’ s all there has never been a president of the united states and the 21st century hallucination vs. hallucination in cold battle in dubious battle no battle at all because the peasants have gone away far into the lost traveler ’ s dream into a passage from homer a woodcutter ’ s hillside peacetime superstition movie on a cold night hector on a cold night achilles around the savage and the maniac the woodcutter draws a ring of fire it burns all winter long he never tires of it and for good reason every face of the flames is doomed and beautiful every spark that shoots out into the freezing air is god ’ s truth given us all over again in the bitter weather of men ’ s hallucinations there has never been a president of the united states there has never been a just war there has never been any life beyond this circle of firelight until now if now is no dream but an asia
in my country our shamans were women and our gods multiple until white people brought an ecstasy of rosaries and our cities today glow with crosses like graveyards as a child in sunday school i was told i ’ d go to hell if i didn ’ t believe in god our teacher was a woman whose daughters wanted to be nuns and i asked what about babies and what about buddha and she said they ’ re in hell too and so i memorized prayers and recited them in front of women i did not believe in deliver us from evil o sweet virgin mary amen o sweet o sweet in this country which calls itself christian what is sweeter than hearing have mercy on us from those who serve different gods o clement o loving o god o god amidst ruins amidst waters fleeing fleeing deliver us from evil o sweet o sweet in this country point at the moon at the stars point at the way the lake lies with a hand full of feathers and they will look at the feathers and kill you for it if a word for religion they don ’ t believe in is magic so be it let us have magic let us have our own mothers and scarves our spirits our shamans and our sacred books let us keep our stars to ourselves and we shall pray to no one let us eat what makes us holy

in flowerbeds we crowd some praying some bowing as the world minute as it is stays in motion box stores doing business fast food joints and above us a crow secular bird lighting on a lamppost while we take pictures or cry as if we could live forever in this gloried surround gazing up at the window holding her bleared hair her mouth that is a frenzy of trapped pollen or dust eyes like smooth shells that make us forget what fertilized the flowers at our feet bulbs fortified with potash or bone meal dried blood which reminds me of the annunziata i saw in italy painted by those who thought color itself was divine crushed shell coral and ash pigments mixed with egg in a man ’ s mouth and i worry about standing too close to the believers i who rubberneck and lie do i stand too close to the woman at least six months along with her own child waving a sonogram with a faint infant shape inside an image scratched by waves light squandered here dilated there compressed oil and dust as every body contains its atlas of salt kiss-worn and always some bud dreamed in springtime and though i ’ m a yarner and one for whom doubt is a clutched root i can ’ t yet walk to my car standing here wondering if after his birth the virgin girl saw the rest of her life would be nothing but a way to talk about that morning gold nearly blinding herdsmen and kings and with its broad warm tongue a cow licking the afterbirth from the hay

it is a dangerous thing to forget the climate of your birthplace to choke out the voices of dead relatives when in dreams they call you by your secret name it is dangerous to spurn the clothes you were born to wear for the sake of fashion dangerous to use weapons and sharp instruments you are not familiar with dangerous to disdain the plaster saints before which your mother kneels praying with embarrassing fervor that you survive in the place you have chosen to live a bare cold room with no pictures on the walls a forgetting place where she fears you will die of loneliness and exposure jesús maría y josé she says el olvido is a dangerous thing

where was it that we went that night that long low building floodlights rimmed in lavender the moon ringed in rose i would rather then have stayed outside where spiderwebs glowed like jellyfish in the damp yew hedges where the paths were chalky pebbles set with giant stepping stones but the film was starting in the air- conditioned dark a crowd of strangers strange families not from our church in rows of metal folding chairs to see a man quartered by horses strain stitched across his shining back then all over at once an unraveling and then the spill of meat a girl pushed through a doorway naked among soldiers she grew a dress to cover herself a blue dress with a blinding sash

so it is sleep comes not on my eyelids nor in my eyes with shaken hair and white aloof pale hands and lips and breasts of iron so she beholds me and yet though sleep comes not to me there comes a vision from the full smooth brow of sleep the white aphrodite moving unbounded by her own hair in the purple beaks of the doves that draw her beaks straight without desire necks bent backward toward lesbos and the flying feet of loves weeping behind her she looks not back she looks not back to where the nine crowned muses about apollo stand like nine corinthian columns singing in clear evening she sees not the lesbians kissing mouth to mouth across lute strings drunken with singing nor the white feet of the oceanides shining and unsandalled before her go cryings and lamentations of barren women a thunder of wings while ghosts of outcast lethean women lamenting stiffen the twilight

are our spirits these loquacious silver gods who glide at some safe distance above their rank and proletarian bodies foul though fascinating landscapes they are that they traverse besmirched with armpits and fruity genitalia and belching gobs and those impulsive blurting sphincters in whose hot updrafts they might ascend and soar o but our spirits are so lustrous so hairless so advanced in their glass-bottomed flying machines which run on just about nothing what quick and icy notions they have that slot into one another like the tightest clocks and how they lick their lips as they gaze down in anticipatory glee for though they would not themselves wish to rough it they certainly will peep through their bedroom windows each a jiggling voyeur of its own ardent body when that body has chanced upon another and the pair of them have knuckled down to their immersive work

can go to bible study every sunday and swear she ’ s still not convinced but she likes to be around people who are we have the same conversation every few years—i ’ ll ask her if she stops to admire the perfect leaves of the japanese maple she waters in her backyard or tell her how i can gaze for hours at a desert sky and know this as divine nature she says doesn ’ t hold her interest not nearly as much as the greens pinks and grays of a diebenkorn abstract or the antique tiffany lamp she finds in san francisco she spends hours with her vegetables tasting the tomatoes she ’ s picked that morning or checking to see which radishes are big enough to pull lately everything she touches bears fruit from new-green string beans to winning golf strokes glamorous hats she designs and sews soaring stocks with their multiplying shares these are the things she can count in her hands the tangibles to feed and pass on to daughters and grandchildren who can ’ t keep up with all the risky numbers she depends on the blood-sugar counts and daily insulin injections the monthly tests of precancerous cells in her liver and lungs she ’ s a mathematical wonder with so many calculations kept alive in her head adding and subtracting when everyone else is asleep
1 we travel upon the ark in mud and rain our oars promises from god we live—and the rest of humanity dies we travel upon the waves fastening our lives to the ropes of corpses filling the skies but between heaven and us is an opening a porthole for a supplication `` why lord have you saved us alone from among all the people and creatures and where are you casting us now to your other land to our first home into the leaves of death into the wind of life in us in our arteries flows a fear of the sun we despair of the light we despair lord of a tomorrow in which to start life anew if only we were not that seedling of creation of earth and its generations if only we had remained simple clay or ember or something in between then we would not have to see this world its lord and its hell twice over '' 2 if time started anew and waters submerged the face of life and the earth convulsed and that god rushed to me beseeching `` noah save the living '' i would not concern myself with his request i would travel upon my ark removing clay and pebbles from the eyes of the dead i would open the depths of their being to the flood and whisper in their veins that we have returned from the wilderness that we have emerged from the cave that we have changed the sky of years that we sail without giving in to our fears— that we do not heed the word of that god our appointment is with death our shores are a familiar and pleasing despair a gelid sea of iron water that we ford to its very ends undeterred heedless of that god and his word longing for a different a new lord
1. a crow gliding over a ravine was the sign his eyes were waiting for they thought they were ready to cross the tumbleweed listening to a cricket and seeing a line of ants snaking in was the figure of his younger sister huddled by him asking for a campfire they made it as far as a roadside store and held their hands over the electric coils when asked if they were going to buy anything their tongues broke off into halves and fell to the floor like popsicles 2. my father says i was born to translate what he could only nod to for years he also says that god made a mistake by blurring out his eyes first because he can hear her asking for a blanket she saw a church adorned with hipbones sun-bleached and beautiful as curved jewelry she dreamt of its wide doors and after dipping her finger in his palm she felt his warmth my father says that cactus needles fly and burn like the memory of lost ones then he tells me i was born to study the sand trails and notice when footsteps drag and turn to knee and handprints those are ones i need to follow he says
i want a god as my accomplice who spends nights in houses of ill repute and gets up late on saturdays a god who whistles through the streets and trembles before the lips of his lover a god who waits in line at the entrance of movie houses and likes to drink café au lait a god who spits blood from tuberculosis and doesn ’ t even have enough for bus fare a god knocked unconscious by the billy club of a policeman at a demonstration a god who pisses out of fear before the flaring electrodes of torture a god who hurts to the last bone and bites the air in pain a jobless god a striking god a hungry god a fugitive god an exiled god an enraged god a god who longs from jail for a change in the order of things i want a more godlike god
i am the angel with the broken wing the one large statue in this quiet room the staff finds me too fierce and so they shut faith ’ s ardor in this air-conditioned tomb the docents praise my elegant design above the chatter of the gallery perhaps i am a masterpiece of sorts— the perfect emblem of futility mendoza carved me for a country church his name ’ s forgotten now except by me i stood beside a gilded altar where the hopeless offered god their misery i heard their women whispering at my feet— prayers for the lost the dying and the dead their candles stretched my shadow up the wall and i became the hunger that they fed i broke my left wing in the revolution even a saint can savor irony when troops were sent to vandalize the chapel they hit me once—almost apologetically for even the godless feel something in a church a twinge of hope fear who knows what it is a trembling unaccounted by their laws an ancient memory they can ’ t dismiss there are so many things i must tell god the howling of the dammed can ’ t reach so high but i stand like a dead thing nailed to a perch a crippled saint against a painted sky
you wanted to be so hungry you would break into branches and have to choose between the starving month ’ s nineteenth twenty-first and twenty-third evenings the liturgy begins to echo itself and why does it matter if the ground-water is too scarce one can stretch nets into the air and harvest the fog hunger opens you to illiteracy thirst makes clear the starving pattern the thick night is so quiet the spinning spider pauses the angel stops whispering for a moment— the secret night could already be over you will have to listen very carefully— you are never going to know which night ’ s mouth is sacredly reciting and which night ’ s recitation is secretly mere wind—

these things i do remember o i pour my soul out for them all the ages long hatred pursueth us through all the years ignorance like a monster hath devoured our martyrs as in one long day of blood rulers have rise through the endless years oppressive savage in their witless power filled with a futile thought to make an end of that which god had cherished there was once a tyrant searching in the book of god for some word there to serve him as a sword to slay us and he found the line which spake “ he that doth steal a man and selleth him he shall be surely put to death. ” that king that dark-designing servant of false gods summoned to him ten sages of the law saying “ pervert the truth not with your lies but judge this thing what if a man be found stealing his brother—one of israel ’ s sons— and making merchandise and selling him ” and the ten sages spake “ that thief shall die. ” “ your fathers ” —said the tyrant “ where are they that sold their brother to a company of ishmaelites lo ye shall now receive justice of heaven upon you for if they were now in life then ye yourselves should judge but now ye bear on you your fathers ’ sin. ” “ if we have sinned ” they said “ then we shall bear his sentence whose compassion fills the world. ” “ give us three days ” they spake and they all looked unto the high priest rabbi ishmael saying “ arise arise pronounce the name know from our god if this be his decree. ” then rabbi ishmael in purity pronounced the name and rising up on high made question of the angel clothed in white who spake “ o righteous o beloved i hearkening within the secret region heard that ye indeed be captured. ” thus he spake and rabbi ishmael descending told his fellows all their doom and that dread king bade the ten sages to be slain in woe and torture lo i saw them all they stepped out of the ages and they walked before the deathless spirit that is mad with hunger for destruction of god ’ s own two of the great in israel were brought forth to slaughter first —the high priest ishmael and rabban simeon son of gamliel a prince in israel and this one implored “ o slay me ere ye slay him lest i see the death of him who ministers to god ” and lo the lot fell and they slew him first and ishmael raised the severed head and cried— bitterly loud as calls a trumpet blast — “ how is the tongue that taught the glorious message brought low to lick the dust ” and while he wept the tyrant ’ s daughter stood and gazing on his beauty made petition for his life with vain entreaty terror makes me dumb to tell the tortures that mine eyes beheld only that when the murderous hand had reached his brow the holy symbol ’ s seat he cried with one most bitter cry to his soul ’ s lord seraphim in the heights of heaven called in anguish “ this is then the law and this the wage thereof o thou who spreadest out light as a garment thus the foe blasphemes thy great and awful name and scorns thy law ” but out of heaven ’ s height a voice replied “ let no sound more be uttered lest i turn the world to water and my throne ’ s footstool to sudden chaos this is my decree accept it all of you who loved the law which i created ere the world was made. ” thus were the princes of the law brought low the corner-stones jeweled with precepts now rabbi akiba was led forth to die hananya too who was teradyon ’ s son torn from his place and yet he held the scroll fast in his arms.—o god blot out their pain mourn o my people not yet widowed —still as in a vision for a worthless whim i see your holiest slaughtered see their blood shed in the name of heaven—as even now the blood of huspith the interpreter trembling takes hold on all who hear and tears flow from all eyes and all delight is dead for eliezer falls shamua ’ s son how have our strong oppressors fed on us how do they give us water of gall to drink— slaying hanina son of hakinai they will not take a ransom they must take the lives of those who speak the law ’ s sweet words yea even now the scribe yeshebab ’ s life sons of unrerason strike us with their fear more than the kings of earth they slay of us many and many verily they cast judah the son of dama unto death ah thou has said jacob shall be a fire joseph a flame—lo the last ashes die o bring the burning of the day of doom for judah son of baba is not spared here were ten righteous men lo they are slain this hath befallen us all this i tell as i beheld it passing through the years of bygone ages and subdued and crushed we pour our hearts out supplicating thee lord lord give ear o pitying merciful look from thine height upon the blood outpoured of all thy righteous make an end of blood poured out and wasted wash the stain away god king who sittest on a gracious throne

the dying words of goethe “ light more light the shadows deepen and my life is ebbing low throw the windows widely open light more light before i go “ softly let the balmy sunshine play around my dying bed e ’ er the dimly lighted valley i with lonely feet must tread “ light more light for death is weaving shadows ‘ round my waning sight and i fain would gaze upon him through a stream of earthly light. ” not for greater gifts of genius not for thoughts more grandly bright all the dying poet whispers is a prayer for light more light heeds he not the gathered laurels fading slowly from his sight all the poet ’ s aspirations centre in that prayer for light gracious saviour when life ’ s day-dreams melt and vanish from the sight may our dim and longing vision then be blessed with light more light

it is said that many have been cured of madness by drinking of the spring in the orchard of this convent but i doubt it for it is a very pleasant place and a surfeit of pleasantries often leads directly to madness i do not have much experience of madness once a sister ran naked down the hall but i have tasted the water and it is clear and fresh there is nothing unpleasant about it the abbess said of a certain man he is a drink of water—meaning he was a bore— but i want to meet that man he would be as welcome in my life as jesus in the orchard here though the fat old abbess might shoo him away i would be so glad to have him drink to serve him with a round of little glasses on a painted tray like the ‘ cocktail parties ’ in the secular world and i the hostess turning her cheek to be kissed in the fray i would wear white clothes and my headdress and he might carry a scythe and cut the morning glories or simply sit and sun his nose but they have taken my lord away lodged him in the earth somewhere call him leaves vines breeze bird it can not be true looking for him in these things condemns us to a lifetime of imbecile activity he has a face arms legs a navel he is a man for he is everything i am not how can it be otherwise before i leave the spring i lean over it and weep i spit upon the flowers i stumble up the hill we are somewhere below the tserna gota— meaning the black mountain—and when i reach the top i count the villages—there are two—where we are the last on earth to think of him as having a head here too is the source of the spring and crows with lethargic dispositions circle and circle the spot

from a story of how the tobacco plant came to our people told to me by my cousin george coser jr. it was way back before there was a way back when time threaded earth and sky children were conceived were born grew and walked tall in what we now call a day there must have been two suns a bright moon somehow we had more light than now sheen of falling in love playing about earth ’ s body in a wild flicker which lit us up we who were this planet and yearned for touch every planted thought grew plant ladders to the stars way back before there was no way back miss mary mack we used to sing along the buttons of her dress our babies are always our babies even back then when time waved through the corn we knew our plants like relatives their stories were our stories there were songs for everything — i should say “ are ” songs for every transformation they link between way back and now the forever now a time when a young mvskoke man and woman walked through the shimmer of the early evening they had become as one song they lay down when it was dark i can hear their intimate low-voice talking how they tease one another with such gut love earth makes a bed with pillow mounds and it is there as the night insects sing they conceived their first child they will look back as they walk east toward the sunrise the raw stalks of beginning will drink the light root deeply dark into earth in the tracks of their loving the plant-child emerges first the seed head then leafy long male body and the white female flowers of tobacco or hece as the people called it when it called to them come here we were brought to you from those who love you we will help you and that ’ s how it began way back when we knew how to hear the songs of plants and could sing back like now on paper with marks like bird feet but where are our ears they have grown to fit around earbuds to hear music made for cold cash like our beloved smoke- making threaded with addiction and dead words sing this song back to me girl in the moonlight tobacco plant had silver moon buttons all up her back we ’ re getting dressed to go plant new songs with words our sun is dimming faster mvto hece mvto hvse mvto e — kanvchaga mvto ah

for naomi ginsberg 1894—1956 i strange now to think of you gone without corsets eyes while i walk on the sunny pavement of greenwich village downtown manhattan clear winter noon and i ’ ve been up all night talking talking reading the kaddish aloud listening to ray charles blues shout blind on the phonograph the rhythm the rhythm—and your memory in my head three years after—and read adonais ’ last triumphant stanzas aloud—wept realizing how we suffer— and how death is that remedy all singers dream of sing remember prophesy as in the hebrew anthem or the buddhist book of answers—and my own imagination of a withered leaf—at dawn— dreaming back thru life your time—and mine accelerating toward apocalypse the final moment—the flower burning in the day—and what comes after looking back on the mind itself that saw an american city a flash away and the great dream of me or china or you and a phantom russia or a crumpled bed that never existed— like a poem in the dark—escaped back to oblivion— no more to say and nothing to weep for but the beings in the dream trapped in its disappearance sighing screaming with it buying and selling pieces of phantom worshipping each other worshipping the god included in it all—longing or inevitability —while it lasts a vision—anything more it leaps about me as i go out and walk the street look back over my shoulder seventh avenue the battlements of window office buildings shouldering each other high under a cloud tall as the sky an instant—and the sky above—an old blue place or down the avenue to the south to—as i walk toward the lower east side—where you walked 50 years ago little girl—from russia eating the first poisonous tomatoes of america—frightened on the dock— then struggling in the crowds of orchard street toward what —toward newark— toward candy store first home-made sodas of the century hand-churned ice cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards— toward education marriage nervous breakdown operation teaching school and learning to be mad in a dream—what is this life toward the key in the window—and the great key lays its head of light on top of manhattan and over the floor and lays down on the sidewalk—in a single vast beam moving as i walk down first toward the yiddish theater—and the place of poverty you knew and i know but without caring now—strange to have moved thru paterson and the west and europe and here again with the cries of spaniards now in the doorstoops doors and dark boys on the street fire escapes old as you -tho you ’ re not old now that ’ s left here with me— myself anyhow maybe as old as the universe—and i guess that dies with us—enough to cancel all that comes—what came is gone forever every time— that ’ s good that leaves it open for no regret—no fear radiators lacklove torture even toothache in the end— though while it comes it is a lion that eats the soul—and the lamb the soul in us alas offering itself in sacrifice to change ’ s fierce hunger—hair and teeth—and the roar of bonepain skull bare break rib rot-skin braintricked implacability ai ai we do worse we are in a fix and you ’ re out death let you out death had the mercy you ’ re done with your century done with god done with the path thru it—done with yourself at last—pure—back to the babe dark before your father before us all—before the world— there rest no more suffering for you i know

frightened telephone calls conception beds relatives hands— no more of sister elanor .—she gone before you—we kept it secret—you killed her—or she killed herself to bear with you—an arthritic heart—but death ’ s killed you both—no matter— nor your memory of your mother 1915 tears in silent movies weeks and weeks—forgetting aggrieve watching marie dressler address humanity chaplin dance in

his cancer—or kill—later perhaps—soon he will think— and it ’ s the last moment i remember which i see them all thru myself now—tho not you i didn ’ t foresee what you felt—what more hideous gape of bad mouth came first—to you—and were you prepared to go where in that dark—that—in that god a radiance a lord in the void like an eye in the black cloud in a dream adonoi at last with you beyond my remembrance incapable to guess not merely the yellow skull in the grave or a box of worm dust and a stained ribbon—deathshead with halo can you believe it is it only the sun that shines once for the mind only the flash of existence than none ever was nothing beyond what we have—what you had—that so pitiful—yet triumph to have been here and changed like a tree broken or flower—fed to the ground—but mad with its petals colored thinking great universe shaken cut in the head leaf stript hid in an egg crate hospital cloth wrapped sore—freaked in the moon brain naughtless no flower like that flower which knew itself in the garden and fought the knife—lost cut down by an idiot snowman ’ s icy—even in the spring—strange ghost thought—some death—sharp icicle in his hand—crowned with old roses—a dog for his eyes—cock of a sweatshop—heart of electric irons all the accumulations of life that wear us out—clocks bodies consciousness shoes breasts—begotten sons—your communism— ‘ paranoia ’

darkness—death stay thy phantoms ii over and over—refrain—of the hospitals—still haven ’ t written your history—leave it abstract—a few images run thru the mind—like the saxophone chorus of houses and

care of you—once and for all—when i vowed forever that once man disagreed with my opinion of the cosmos i was lost— by my later burden—vow to illuminate mankind—this is release of particulars— mad as you — sanity a trick of agreement — but you stared out the window on the broadway church corner and spied a mystical assassin from newark so phoned the doctor— ‘ ok go way for a rest ’ —so i put on my coat and walked you downstreet—on the way a grammarschool boy screamed unaccountably— ‘ where you goin lady to death ’ i shuddered— and you covered your nose with motheaten fur collar gas mask against

nikita zips across stage trailed by a troop of white-gloved one-wheelers killer joes the 12 under crew in disguise a sixth sense guides him beyond darkness an inner voice says when don ’ t stop don ’ t stop don ’ t stop i ’ ll tell you when a constellation of funeral homes jumpsuits red white ribbons in the sky the total groove a carnival of roses circling the moon mere call response never knocked socks this way lifting nicknames dates from the faces of tombstones and mere call response never will god climbs inside asking for souls— something we weren ’ t taught to share
de vulgari eloquentia i i “ we will endeavor the word aiding us from heaven to be of service to the vernacular speech ” —from “ heaven ” these “ draughts of the sweetest honey-milk ” si dolcemente from the language we first heard endearments whisperings infant song and revery a world we wanted to go out into to come to ourselves into organizations in the sound of them verging upon meaning upon “ heaven ” hermetic talk into which my range of understandings was to grow for love of it portents and adults expounding controversial doctrines personal science fictions and rules of order but our own “ is that which we acquire without any rule ” for love of it “ imitating our nurses ”
out here in the desert everything is one thing the desert what god but the one god exotic in his reachless amount casting love over our encampment beside the nervy water of jordan john you have a little gristle when you speak and what ’ s left of you is the scrape of a year starved on grasshoppers it is touching to see the basin of your devoted body a little bit east whole lambs were smeared on the temple the city was coiled white within its walls violet its muscles twisting over muscles the temple sleek at the top smiled with music—it might ’ ve lifted for a second i was just there the priests wore such tall hats heavenly bodies dropped behind their eyes the mothers of jerusalem suggested curtains tattering down from the markets that whirred with the songs of bargaining parting one from the other laughing home the dust lifted into the hair of the peaceful citizens and was shaken out the land was socializing the invalids were blind as stars the children plaited their hair in a manner pleasing to mountain lions the boys the trumpets bellowed like lonely bulls—they were distressed despite their red velvet dresses the widows were wrapping themselves in silk as their sons carried nearby stones outside the city mules were begging to be beaten with softer sticks a yellowing vine was making love to a young tree grape skins were staining the feet of dancers merchant ’ s fingers became little bodies which wrapped themselves around each coin cups of hot tea startled the mouths of the idle a tangle of serpents tried to choose just one mate the lit membrane of a sheet hung in a window to dry itself a heavenly body i could go on john but why leave the sheet what sermon on hope or virtue can you make that is more convincing than it leaving the city was a wrenching kind of death but lying here by you john in rocks and flat dirt—heaven is unexpected
on summer nights i sleep naked in jerusalem my bed stands on the brink of a deep valley without rolling down into it in the daytime i walk around with the ten commandments on my lips like an old tune someone hums to himself oh touch me touch me good woman that ’ s not a scar you feel under my shirt that ’ s a letter of recommendation folded up tight from my father “ all the same he ’ s a good boy and full of love. ” i remember my father waking me for early prayers he would do it by gently stroking my forehead not by tearing away the blanket since then i love him even more and as his reward may he be wakened gently and with love on the day of the resurrection
i will die this month how i do not know still there is much work to be done i am afraid not for myself but for betty and the girls some nights i stay awake looking out the window a gun in my hand i know how cruel people can be i have known hatred and blindness there are brothers waiting to do me harm i will die for them i will love them as only i can may allah be my witness
on friday at twilight of a summer day while the smells of food and prayer rose from every house and the sound of the sabbath angels ’ wings was in the air while still a child i started to lie to my father “ i went to another synagogue. ” i don ’ t know if he believed me or not but the taste of the lie was good and sweet on my tongue and in all the houses that night hymns rose up along with lies to celebrate the sabbath and in all the houses that night sabbath angels died like flies in a lamp and lovers put mouth to mouth blew each other up until they floated upward or burst and since then the lie has been good and sweet on my tongue and since then i always go to another synagogue and my father returned the lie when he died “ i ’ ve gone to another life ”
at a book of details of all the moments when knowledge is acquired a sort of expanded balloon sighs and says “ we are what came before. ” “ the storm in the window of the mind ” the sleeping sister says while she ’ s walking around wonderland watching a cat touching down and talking not a car in sight a cemetery seen from the air all the obelisks you could ever ask for
a lot of the painting here is painting over can everyone at the back hear over everyone everyone is a blast of light seeping across the film all day high toothy windows whiten in flashlight we are much like we were five times a day things don ’ t change that much in five centuries for ten centuries before it was faces those were faces yes they were angels the gold mosaic is as fine as an angel ’ s velvet wing the christian building is spongy yellow ochre gold the islamic additions are sheer yellow baby blue black and gold red crosses seep through baby blue a woman kisses her cross and crosses herself another is kissed by a pink polo shirt and camera a camera will not put the rest of christ back in it will not take away the crowd around christ ’ s toes the crowded reference image accompanying the fragments pigeons wing through the high windows and up in fragments christ ’ s toes christ ’ s fingertips christ ’ s thigh christ on high sandals expose toes in the highlights
on my desk there is a stone with the word “ amen ” on it a triangular fragment of stone from a jewish graveyard destroyed many generations ago the other fragments hundreds upon hundreds were scattered helter-skelter and a great yearning a longing without end fills them all first name in search of family name date of death seeks dead man ’ s birthplace son ’ s name wishes to locate name of father date of birth seeks reunion with soul that wishes to rest in peace and until they have found one another they will not find a perfect rest only this stone lies calmly on my desk and says “ amen. ” but now the fragments are gathered up in lovingkindness by a sad good man he cleanses them of every blemish photographs them one by one arranges them on the floor in the great hall makes each gravestone whole again one again fragment to fragment like the resurrection of the dead a mosaic a jigsaw puzzle child ’ s play
the morning air is all awash with angels—richard wilbur “ love calls us to the things of this world ” the eyes open to a blue telephone in the bathroom of this five-star hotel i wonder whom i should call a plumber proctologist urologist or priest who is blessed among us and most deserves the first call i choose my father because he ’ s astounded by bathroom telephones i dial home my mother answers “ hey ma ” i say “ can i talk to poppa ” she gasps and then i remember that my father has been dead for nearly a year “ shit mom ” i say “ i forgot he ’ s dead i ’ m sorry— how did i forget ” “ it ’ s okay ” she says “ i made him a cup of instant coffee this morning and left it on the table— like i have for what twenty-seven years— and i didn ’ t realize my mistake until this afternoon. ” my mother laughs at the angels who wait for us to pause during the most ordinary of days and sing our praise to forgetfulness before they slap our souls with their cold wings those angels burden and unbalance us those fucking angels ride us piggyback those angels forever falling snare us and haul us prey and praying into dust
what did i know what did i know of gazing silences and terrored stone brilliances beauty of what ’ s hardbitten the auroral darkness which is god then you arrived meditative ironic my head gripped in bony vice mouth of agony shaping a cry it can not utter what did i know what did i know of a changing permanence the stains and dirty tools of struggle weaving a wish and a weariness together years before your time years and years i gaze through layered light within the rock of the undiscovered suns i see i walk with you among the landscape lush metallic flayed behind us beyond us now the very sunlight here seems flammable
like fishermen at dusk the soldiers returned from war with stories slumped over their shoulders their fingers firm at the knot the netting thick and tangled with the names of the dead none could explain how the flood of life all around them escaped like water from between cupped hands how the bodies of men they loved began to crust the earth like salt how destruction danced slapdash and unashamed everywhere and still they survived when i came home from college proud my educated mouth agape a tackle box of words slick and glossy and i saw the names of my friends the young men i fought with learned to drink with and left behind lil ’ rocc pumpkin ulysses junebug aghoster names spray-painted throughout our neighborhood in memoriam i couldn ’ t understand how a god could make one life possible and strip the world clean of so many or how like high-watermarks the dead remind the living of the coming of storms
this misalliance follows the custom for female children to adhere to maternal practices while the atheist father presides over the prattle of the churchgoer with ironical commentary from his arm-chair but by whichever religious route to brute reality our forebears speed us there is often a pair of idle adult accomplices in duplicity to impose upon their brood an assumed acceptance of the grace of god defamed as human megalomania seeding the testament with inconcievable chastisement and of christ who come with his light of toilless lilies to say “ fear not it is i ” wanting us to be fearful he who bowed the ocean tossed with holy feet which supposedly dead are suspended over head neat- ly crossed in anguish wounded with red varnish from these slow-drying bloods of mysticism mysteriously the something-soul emerges miserably and instinct of economy in every race for reconstructing debris has planted an avenging face in outer darkness the lonely peering eye of humanity looked into the néant and turned away ova ’ s consciousness impulsive to commit itself to justice —to arise and walk its innate straight way out of the accidence of circumstance— collects the levitate chattels of its will and makes for the magnetic horizon of liberty with the soul ’ s foreverlasting opposition to disintegration so this child of exodus with her heritage of emigration often “ sets out to seek her fortune ” in her turn trusting to terms of literature dodging the breeders ’ determination not to return “ entities sent on consignment ” by their maker nature except in a condition of moral effacement lest paul and peter never notice the creatures ever had had fathers and mothers they were disgraced in their duty should such spirits take an express passage through the family bodies to arrive at eternity as lovely as they originally promised so on whatever days she chose to “ run away ” the very street corners of kilburn close in upon ova to deliver her into the hands of her procreators oracle of civilization ‘ thou shalt not live by dreams alone but by every discomfort that proceedeth out of legislation ’
i painted a phoenix in bright colors cut it in nine pieces and cooked it in a pot at the mountaintop i stirred it as if cranking reels of a movie unraveled were a series of faces in mosaic kurosawa appeared he asked me what my story was about tongue-tied i could not answer he handed me a token with a silvery eagle engraved ready to fly how real i thought everything was in my dream in my waking hour i see the remnant of the war between my head and heart now in cease-fire my chest is filled with the fresh breeze of serenity i begin to breathe gently as my story is unraveled like in a movie no longer haunted my love of god soars as i see my guardian angel smile in the clear blue sky transforming to one gigantic phoenix my wandering in the wilderness of the mind has taught me a little wisdom i believe my dreams are real as my life is a dream
—bahram pakistani 14-year-old held in an afghan prison like the pied piper the mullah drives his battered truck through dusty villages his loudspeaker singing join the battle against the infidels fight for jihad and live eternally with allah lift up your guns for him and you shall never die barefoot boys ragged hungry from years of hard soil follow him dancing into the straps of loaded guns pirouetting into caves and broken buildings and the boys end up in a land not their own but are told god is everywhere many die others disappear into dark prison bowels where each day if you are 12 twelve filthy men one after another if you are 14 then fourteen is your lot a father sells tea from a cart one cup at a time washes the tiles of a mosque with a yellow bar of soap to earn the ransom the soldiers exact every night in his dreams his son stands calling father i never seen such days as this
my sin is an act of cruelty depriving myself of worldly desires locked in a rented room i sit all day listening to the murmurs of many-headed visions cockroaches are my temporary friends dwelling in their underground castles the ocean is my mother i visit in need of love and companionship she only listens to my laughs and cries like god in presence old wounds all over again come hand in hand off and on like jealous friends wanting someone else ’ s credit under a lamp in the night i meet a unicorn sitting in my mirror
barely twenty-five he smells of yesterday ’ s spit and vomit black beard droops in clumps from his drawn sun-savaged face hanging from a string around his neck a small holy book this man was once a child held against the breast of a mother who kissed his small meaty hands that smelled of milk and tears
maybe because i was married and felt secure and dead at once i listened to my father ’ s urgings about “ the future ” and bought this double plot on the hillside with a view of the bare white church the old elms and the creek below i plan now to use both plots luxuriantly spreading out in the middle of a big double bed —but no finally my burial has nothing to do with marriage this lying here in these same bones will be as real as anything i can imagine for who i ’ ll be then as real as anything undergone going back and forth to “ the world ” out there and here to this one spot on earth i really know once i came in fast and low in a little plane and when i looked down at the church the trees i ’ ve felt with my hands the neighbors ’ houses and the family farm and i saw how tiny what i loved or knew was it was like my children going on with their plans and griefs at a distance and nothing i could do about it but i wanted to reach down and pat it while letting it know i wouldn ’ t interfere for the world the world being everything this isn ’ t this unknown buried in the known
we can never be with loss too long behind the warped door that sticks the wood thrush calls to the monks pausing upon the stone crucifix singing “ i am marvelous alone ” thrash thrash goes the hayfield rows of marrow and bone undone the horizon ’ s flashing fastens tight sealing the blue hills with vermilion moss dyes a squirrel ’ s skull green the cemetery expands its borders— little milky crosses grow like teeth how kind time is altering space so nothing stays wrong and light more new light always arrives
a moth lies open and lies like an old bleached beech leaf a lean-to between window frame and sill its death protects a collection of tinier deaths and other dirts beneath although the white paint is water-stained on it death is dirt and hapless the just-severed tiger lily is drinking its glass of water i hope this hope is sere this hope is severe what you ruin ruins you too and so you hope for favor i mean i do the underside of a ladybug wanders the window i wander the continent my undercarriage not as evident so go more perilously it seems to me but i am only me to you it seems clear i mean to disappear and am mean and project on you some ancient fear if i were a bug i hope i wouldn ’ t be this giant winged thing spindly like a crane fly skinny-legged like me kissing the cold ceiling fumbling for the face of the other seeking it came in with me last night when i turned on the light i lay awake afraid it would touch my face it wants out i want out too i thought you a way through arms wide for wings your suffering mine twinned screen your unbelief drives me in doubt for dirt white sheet for sill— you don ’ t stay other enough or still enough to be likened to
their eggs are laid on lupine tiny jade hairstreaks i could easily mistake for dew too precious too incidental and besides that blue these trills that flounce in my potato patch drawn from dryland origins to the domestic stain of water from my hose what an old woman would study i think as you hand me the guidebook distracted by the replica of a parasol growing out of a bleached cow pie the siamese kitten with his butterfly eyes comes running his mouth full of swallowtail his breath smelling of borax and sugar i have poured over the ant hills in the garden he is young and intent on eating poison we bushwhack through paradise what is there to say except to lament the daily evidence of its passing how the common blues scatter from my shade and you so fragile so sick so thin your diet restricted keep pointing out the bearded face of larkspur when the angels fell a fifteenth-centruy bishop says there were 133 306 668 of them it takes us all afternoon to cross the field the body it is so sad what happens to it if you fell you would dry up instantly but these are not angel wings who disguise themselves as leaf or shred of bark who are named after the stops in meaning our language must make room for the comma whose wings look battered or the violet underside of the question mark to keep the mind from clenching you say is the main thing even the most beautiful days always seem to have death in them as valentinus said our fall into love and sleep you especially like the dark alpines with their furred bodies and lack of marking and the sulphurs yellowed scraps that fall from a myth of origin that doesn ’ t include us when we find them we will wonder who is still alive we speak of our souls with such surface ease but who will take such care for us you bend and bend to the scrappy blue sea your back turned to the moon fluttering above you i have been thinking so much of strength this week yours and mine i mean the field of attention that can be strengthened

i here is your eye here are the alleles which give color to your eye the mixed routes of reference the million times more than anybody could ever be missed flock the idea of flock hundreds of agitated birds swooping over the bridge our blessèd moments shapes of soft parts a quantifiable relation to objects we turn now to your vitreous humor shut the lights off turn the meat down cover your head i started doing my duty graphs of a dancer ’ s movements ten sections of a neural issue as from air to the cornea who in the person is larval or asexual who in the person will sit in hachure a parallel walk from one density to a different density i was you once come come under your skin in the body receiving itself or its analogies the my the bow down before you white pine to white pine white pine to redwing to lantern fish ii she was full she was full with it iii and then though through though and then through the loop just made iv believe it or not i would swap his desire to see patterns gathering believe it or not we set off several long-haired bodies believe it or not that was the whole of our aestivation believe it or not stop talking about me as if i were not in the room pop open a new one the developing figure was a monk bent over come allow us to see the sower sow she contested the waters get thee behind something in her eye kept giving you the needle something in her eye kept falling out of line believe it or not three persons in one shadow believe it or not could you spare a mind it clawed each thing as if a temporal sequence it clawed each thing as if a temporal w/hole believe it or not six or eight ways of counting on your reticence believe it or not these long thin rods and the wider cones
but of course these poems are about men which we become by defining how we are not women and so becoming a shadow devouring the light to find the limits which is what richard pryor would have told joan of arc in a joke funnier for being sexist “ it ’ s a man thang. ” and of course there is god and its problematic relationship to light not to mention the question of permission who builds the box the shape it makes sense that jesus the new man 2,000 years ago was a carpenter you need that craft the precision of measurement angles of angels who incidentally are never women just ask the romans who called them angelo angelus never angela— that lie was coined by a dissident nun hiding her feminism under the cover of rapture but is it enough to announce yourself to beat your chest in contrition calling mea culpa mea culpa guilt can never be enough mere intent—where is its purpose yet there are no answers there are only lines that disappear into horizons that girder us with safety just as there is no way to end this poem
i called you names for the further processing of color or movement all you were able to get into a sort of blur she leaned out against the water lay me down like anthozoa to anthozoa with the other light things that brush against the earth breathe do n't breathe breathe a figure in a constellation was staring off did it turn up three days later did it accept inside its body a no for universal application an only mine or yours gate one open your mouth if you would only open your mouth gate two to bridle to curb to dam gate three anagnorisis gate four closed gate five hold up gate six if everywhere that mary went the brain was public and exposed gate seven do you mind do you gate eight fish moving in the boat 's direction will be recorded in our diagram with the more substantial marks gate nine the rhythm and interval between objects gate ten our simplest subject our lightest lights our darkest darks
at six i lived for spells how a few hawaiian words could call up the rain could hymn like the sea in the long swirl of chambers curling in the nautilus of a shell how amida ’ s ballads of the buddhaland in the drone of the priest ’ s liturgy could conjure money from the poor and give them nothing but mantras the strange syllables that healed desire i lived for stories about the war my grandfather told over hana cards slapping them down on the mats with a sharp japanese kiai i lived for songs my grandmother sang stirring curry into a thick stew weaving a calligraphy of kannon ’ s love into grass mats and straw sandals i lived for the red volcano dirt staining my toes the salt residue of surf and sea wind in my hair the arc of a flat stone skipping in the hollow trough of a wave i lived in a child ’ s world waited for my father to drag himself home dusted with blasts of sand powdered and the strange ash of raw cement his deafness made worse by the clang of pneumatic drills sore in his bones from the buckings of a jackhammer he ’ d hand me a scarred lunchpail let me unlace the hightop g.i boots call him the new name i ’ d invented that day in school write it for him on his newspaper he ’ d rub my face with hands that felt like gravel roads tell me to move go play an then he ’ d walk to the laundry sink to scrub rinse the dirt of his long day from a face brown and grained as koa wood i wanted to take away the pain in his legs the swelling in his joints give him back his hearing clear and rare as crystal chimes the fins of glass that wrinkled and sparked the air with their sound i wanted to heal the sores that work and war had sent to him let him play catch in the backyard with me tossing a tennis ball past papaya trees without the shoulders of pain shrugging back his arms i wanted to become a doctor of pure magic to string a necklace of sweet words fragrant as pine needles and plumeria fragrant as the bread my mother baked place it like a lei of cowrie shells and pikake flowers around my father ’ s neck and chant him a blessing a sutra
excerpt hark ’ tis the twanging horn o ’ er yonder bridge that with its wearisome but needful length bestrides the wintry flood in which the moon sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright he comes the herald of a noisy world with spatter ’ d boots strapp ’ d waist and frozen locks news from all nations lumb ’ ring at his back true to his charge the close-pack ’ d load behind yet careless what he brings his one concern is to conduct it to the destin ’ d inn and having dropp ’ d th ’ expected bag—pass on he whistles as he goes light-hearted wretch cold and yet cheerful messenger of grief perhaps to thousands and of joy to some to him indiff ’ rent whether grief or joy houses in ashes and the fall of stocks births deaths and marriages epistles wet with tears that trickled down the writer ’ s cheeks fast as the periods from his fluent quill or charg ’ d with am ’ rous sighs of absent swains or nymphs responsive equally affect his horse and him unconscious of them all but oh th ’

the curtains wheel the sofa round and while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn throws up a steamy column and the cups that cheer but not inebriate wait on each so let us welcome peaceful ev ’ ning in

patient stands till his feet throb and his head thumps to feed upon the breath of patriots bursting with heroic rage or placemen all tranquility and smiles this folio of four pages happy work which not ev ’ n critics criticise that holds inquisitive attention while i read fast bound in chains of silence which the fair though eloquent themselves yet fear to break what is it but a map of busy life its fluctuations and its vast concerns oh winter ruler of th ’ inverted year thy scatter ’ d hair with sleet like ashes fill ’ d thy breath congeal ’ d upon thy lips thy cheeks fring ’ d with a beard made white with other snows than those of age thy forehead wrapt in clouds a leafless branch thy sceptre and thy throne a sliding car indebted to no wheels but urg ’ d by storms along its slipp ’ ry

1. god love you now if no one else will ever corpse in the paddy or dead on a high hill in the fine and ruinous summer of a war you never wanted all your false flags were of bravery and ignorance like grade school maps colors of countries you would never see— until that weekend in eternity when laughing well armed perfectly ready to kill the world and your brother the safe commanders sent you into your future oh dead on a hill dead in a paddy leeched and tumbled to a tomb of footnotes we mourn a changeling you handselled to poverty and drummed to war by distinguished masters whom you never knew 2. the bee that spins his metal from the sun the shy mole drifting like a miner ghost through midnight earth—all happy creatures run as strict as trains on rails the circuits of blind instinct happy in your summer follies you mined a culture that was mined for war the state to mold you church to bless and always the elders to confirm you in your ignorance no scholar put your thinking cap on nor warned that in dead seas fishes died in schools before inventing legs to walk the land the rulers stuck a tennis racket in your hand an ark against the flood in time of change courage is not enough the blind mole dies and you on your hill who did not know the rules 3. wet in the windy counties of the dawn the lone crow skirls his draggled passage home and god whose sparrows fall aslant his gaze like grace or confetti blinks and he is gone and you are gone your scarecrow valor grows and rusts like early lilac while the rose blooms in dakota and the stock exchange flowers roses rents all things conspire to crown your death with wreaths of living fire and the public mourners come the politic tear is cast in the forum but in another year we will mourn you whose fossil courage fills the limestone histories brave ignorant amazed dead in the rice paddies dead on the nameless hills
i sit with my railroad face and ask god to forgive me for being a straight line toward the dead who were buried with their poor clothes in the arizona desert of iron borders this way of waving to the embers of the past not apologzing for carrying torn rosaries inside my pockets where beads of worry became fossilized insects whose dry husks i kept since a child faces adopted me from boys who hated their parents i was told not to repeat this reminded by the priest who unmasked himself i was told there was a great horror down the hallway of the smelly catholic school once my friend joey jumped off the second floor window and flattened his brains over the asphalt yard i see a hibiscus blossom it is a bright yellow flower that lasts one day its shape brings tears saves me from the hummingbird that dots the air with patterns resembling an alphabet too familiar to smell like a railroad worker i love heaven when i admit the spikes and the railroad ties came from the labor of fate and not the labor of love the tracks are my cross the tiny car is full of sweating men they look into the eye of the sun hold their hammers over their blackened heads if staring grows in the common search a perfume dots the heart with greed silence between the lightning of pounding stakes once i rode the train home to see if the smoke from the speeding engine was going to enter my lungs i never wore the old yellow hat of the crew but returned the shovel and the bag of railroad spikes thought i saw my grandfather the foreman running across the desert in overalls changing his skin from brown to the black of the scorched engine i live with my railroad face its smoothness hammered by sweating crews that knew the line of hot iron was going to end in the west someday i live with my railroad face and don ’ t know why the tracks disappear on the horizon i cross my railroad face and comb my hair
men who have hardly uncurled from their posture in the womb naked heads bowed not in prayer but in contemplation of the earth they came from that suckled them on the brown milk that builds bone not brain who called them forth to walk in the green light their thoughts on darkness their women who are not madonnas have babes at the breast with the wise time-ridden faces of the christ child in a painting by a florentine master the warriors prepare poison with love ’ s care for the sebastians of their arrows they have no god but follow the contradictions of a ritual that says life must die that life may go on they wear flowers in their hair
i sit and sew—a useless task it seems my hands grown tired my head weighed down with dreams— the panoply of war the martial tred of men grim-faced stern-eyed gazing beyond the ken of lesser souls whose eyes have not seen death nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath— but—i must sit and sew i sit and sew—my heart aches with desire— that pageant terrible that fiercely pouring fire on wasted fields and writhing grotesque things once men my soul in pity flings appealing cries yearning only to go there in that holocaust of hell those fields of woe— but—i must sit and sew the little useless seam the idle patch why dream i here beneath my homely thatch when there they lie in sodden mud and rain pitifully calling me the quick ones and the slain you need me christ it is no roseate dream that beckons me—this pretty futile seam it stifles me—god must i sit and sew
there was dai puw he was no good they put him in the fields to dock swedes and took the knife from him when he came home at late evening with a grin like the slash of a knife on his face there was llew puw and he was no good every evening after the ploughing with the big tractor he would sit in his chair and stare into the tangled fire garden opening his slow lips like a snail there was huw puw too what shall i say i have heard him whistling in the hedges on and on as though winter would never again leave those fields and all the trees were deformed and lastly there was the girl beauty under some spell of the beast her pale face was the lantern by which they read in life ’ s dark book the shrill sentence god is love
primeval beasts rearing from green slime— an illiterate country unable to read its own name stones moved into position on the hills ’ sides snakes laid their eggs in their cold shadow the earth suffered the sky ’ s shrapnel bled yellow into the enraged sea at night heavily over the heaving forests the moon sagged the ancestors of the tigers brightened their claws such sounds as there were came from the strong torn by the stronger the dawn tilted an unpolished mirror for the runt mind to look at itself in without recognition neolithic i shall not be here and the way things are going now won ’ t want to be wheels go no faster than what pulls them that land visible over the sea in clear weather they say we will get there some time soon and take possession of it what then more acres to cultivate and no markets for the crops the young are not what they were smirking at the auspices of the entrails some think there will be a revival i don ’ t believe it this plucked music has come to stay the natural breathing of the pipes was to a different god imagine depending on the intestines of a polecat for accompaniment to one ’ s worship i have attended at the sacrifice of the language that is the liturgy the priests like and felt the draught that was god leaving i think some day there will be nothing left but to go back to the place i came from and wrap myself in the memory of how i was young once and under the covenant of that god not given to folly christian they were bearded like the sea they came from rang stone bells for their stone hearers their cells fitted them like a coffin out of them their prayers seeped delicate flowers where weeds grew their dry bread broke like a bone wine in the cup was a blood-stained mirror for sinners to look into with one eye closed and see themselves forgiven mediaeval i was my lord ’ s bard telling again sweetly what had been done bloodily we lived in a valley he had no lady fame was our horizon in the spring of the year the wind brought the news of a woman ’ s beauty her eyes were still stones in her smooth-running hair her voice was the birds ’ envy we made a brave foray the engagement was furious we came back alone sing me my lord said the things nearer home my falcons my horse i did so he listened my harp was of fire the notes bounced like sparks off his spirit ’ s anvil to-morrow he promised we will ride forth again modern and the brittle gardens of dinorwig deep in the fallen petals of their slate flowers such the autumn of a people whose spring is it sleeps in a glass bulb ready to astonish us with its brilliance bring on the dancing girls of the future the swaying pylons with their metal hair bickering towards england
i want you to know how it was whether the cross grinds into dust under men ’ s wheels or shines brightly as a monument to a new era there was a church and one man served it and few worshipped there in the raw light on the hill in winter moving among the stones fallen about them like the ruins of a culture they were too weak to replace too poor themselves to do anything but wait for the ending of a life they had not asked for the priest would come and pull on the hoarse bell nobody heard and enter that place of darkness sour with the mould of the years and the spider would run from the chalice and the wine lie there for a time cold and unwanted by all but he while the candles guttered as the wind picked at the roof and he would see over that bare meal his face staring at him from the cracked glass of the window with the lips moving like those of an inhabitant of a world beyond this and so back to the damp vestry to the book where he would scratch his name and the date he could hardly remember sunday by sunday while the place sank to its knees and the earth turned from season to season like the wheel of a great foundry to produce you friend who will know what happened
‘ poems from prison about what ’ ‘ life and god. ’ ‘ god in prison friend you trifle with me his face perhaps at the bars fading like life. ’ ‘ he came in with the warder striving with him where else did the severity of the man spring from but awareness of a charity he must overcome ’ ‘ the blows then were god chastening the beloved who was the more blessed the dispenser or receiver of them ’ ‘ it is the same outside bars walls but make the perspective clear deus absconditus we ransack the heavens the distance between stars the last place we look is in prison his hideout in flesh and bone. ’ ‘ you believe then ’ ‘ the poems are witness if his world contracted it was to give birth to the larger vision not meadows empty of him animal eyes impersonal as glass communicate god on the bare walls of a cell the oppressor watches the diminishing of his human shadow as he withdraws from the light ’
i emerge from the mind ’ s cave into the worse darkness outside where things pass and the lord is in none of them i have heard the still small voice and it was that of the bacteria demolishing my cosmos i have lingered too long on this threshold but where can i go to look back is to lose the soul i was leading upwards towards the light to look forward ah what balance is needed at the edges of such an abyss i am alone on the surface of a turning planet what to do but like michelangelo ’ s adam put my hand out into unknown space hoping for the reciprocating touch
god washes clean the souls and hearts of you his favored ones whose backs bend o ’ er the soil which grudging gives to them requite for toil in sober graces and in vision true god places in your hands the pow ’ r to do a service sweet your gift supreme to foil the bare-fanged wolves of hunger in the moil of life ’ s activities yet all too few your glorious band clean sprung from nature ’ s heart the hope of hungry thousands in whose breast dwells fear that you should fail god placed no dart of war within your hands but pow ’ r to start tears praise love joy enwoven in a crest to crown you glorious brave ones of the soil
in memory of the painters paul klee and paul terence feeley i the painter ’ s eye follows relation out his work is not to paint the visible he says it is to render visible being a man and not a god he stands already in a world of sense from which he borrows to begin with mental things chiefly the abstract elements of language the point the line the plane the colors and the geometric shapes of these he spins relation out he weaves its fabric up so that it speaks darkly as music does singing the secret history of the mind and when in this the visible world appears as it does do mountain flower cloud and tree all haunted here and there with the human face it happens as by accident although the accident is of design it is because language first rises from the speechless world that the painterly intelligence can say correctly that he makes his world not imitates the one before his eyes hence the delightsome gardens the dark shores the terrifying forests where nightfall enfolds a lost and tired traveler and hence the careless crowd deludes itself by likening his hieroglyphic signs and secret alphabets to the drawing of a child that likeness is significant the other side of what they see for his simplicities are not the first ones but the furthest ones final refinements of his thought made visible he is the painter of the human mind finding and faithfully reflecting the mindfulness that is in things and not the things themselves for such a man art is an act of faith prayer the study of it as blake says and praise the practice nor does he divide making from teaching or from theory the three are one and in his hours of art there shines a happiness through darkest themes as though spirit and sense were not at odds ii the painter as an allegory of the mind at genesis he takes a burlap bag tears it open and tacks it on a stretcher he paints it black because as he has said everything looks different on black suppose the burlap bag to be the universe and black because its volume is the void before the stars were at the painter ’ s hand volume becomes one-sidedly a surface and all his depths are on the face of it against this flat abyss this groundless ground of zero thickness stretched against the cold dark silence of the absolutely not material worlds arise the colored earths and oil of plants that imitate the light they imitate the light that is in thought for the mind relates to thinking as the eye relates to light only because the world already is a language can the painter speak according to his grammar of the ground it is archaic speech that has not yet divided out its cadences in words it is a language for the oldest spells about how some thoughts rose into the mind while others stranger still sleep in the world so grows the garden green the sun vermilion he sees the rose flame up and fade and fall and be the same rose still the radiant in red he paints his language and his language is the theory of what the painter thinks iii the painter ’ s eye attends to death and birth together seeing a single energy momently manifest in every form as in the tree the growing of the tree exploding from the seed not more nor less than from the void condensing down and in summoning sun and rain he views the tree the great tree standing in the garden say as thrusting downward its vast spread and weight growing its green height from the dark watered earth and as suspended weightless in the sky haled forth and held up by the hair of its head he follows through the flowing of the forms from the divisions of the trunk out to the veinings of the leaf and the leaf ’ s fall his pencil meditates the many in the one after the method in the confluence of rivers the running of ravines on mountainsides and in the deltas of the nerves he sees how things must be continuous with themselves as with whole worlds that they themselves are not in order that they may be so transformed he stands where the eternity of thought opens upon perspective time and space he watches mind become incarnate then he paints the tree iv these thoughts have chiefly been about the painter klee about how he in our hard time might stand to us especially whose lives concern themselves with learning as patron of the practical intelligence of art and thence as model modest and humorous in sufferings for all research that follows spirit where it goes that there should be much goodness in the world much kindness and intelligence candor and charm and that it all goes down in the dust after a while this is a subject for the steadiest meditations of the heart and mind as for the tears that clarify the eye toward charity so may it be to all of us that at some times in this bad time when faith in study seems to fail and when impatience in the street and still despair at home divide the mind to rule it there shall be some comfort come from the remembrance of so deep and clear a life as his whom i have thought of for the wholeness of his mind as the painter dreaming in the scholar ’ s house his dream an emblem to us of the life of thought the same dream that then flared before intelligence when light first went forth looking for the eye
i have nothing to recant i am just the decanter you the just destroyer have in faith become the role recalling for those gathered the noble fallen with a prayer to his-grace-above-fire “ turn me i ’ m burnt on that side ” st. lawrence well done i applaud and you well executed this is it not much else to await when our fates touch i ’ ve nowhere to be but eternity you ’ ve nothing to catch but the thatch dry on dry we keep our wits about us no one to meet but our match
tragedy began with a dance in the guise of goats said aristotle tragedy began with a sacrifice of goats said eratosthenes they came to a circle of columns or great white trees they drank red resveratrol wine from the bottle a classicist shouts those are not differing accounts one must kill a goat to dress as a satyr way of necessity way of the wine a fluid ounce— in galilee where he has turned said john the water into rhyme a god ’ s son or a vintner dies not differing accounts when laser diode udometers measure millennia later the rainfall on fields that yield grapes for wine— a miracle ’ s a narrative with time condensed an ounce for the gorgeous man in the gutter the beggar-poet cries and some crab legs with clarified butter
in the suburbs on a bike path that in any other age would be a road roughed halfway through some dark wood ’ s listening heart two damp young men in suits sucked dry of light walk stiffly and uncertain round a bend in each left hand the black box of a book they see me then spread out to fill the way as sun blares down and dry may wind slaps cheap loose plastic cloth against their shins the thinner taller blond one greets me in an earnest tone these days not often heard and when i do not take his offered hand surprised he pulls it back by jerked degrees says i ’ m elder white this is elder cole we ’ d like to talk with you about then without my willing it this left palm rises as if to let them read what life has written there and with eyes as steady as i always hoped they were i meet the blue and shaking gaze of this elder who is younger than my unborn son ’ s first son and without warmth or cold not harsh or kind say i do not want to talk about this these boys awkward in cloth and flesh of men stammer in relief their soft farewells and what i would not let them save or name stands long in silence looking after them

my father at the dictionary-stand touches the page to fully understand the lamplit answer tilting in his hand his slowly scanning magnifying lens a blurry glistening circle he suspends above the word “ carnation. ” then he bends so near his eyes are magnified and blurred one finger on the miniature word as if he touched a single key and heard a distant plucked infinitesimal string “ the obligation due to every thing that ’ s smaller than the universe. ” i bring my sewing needle close enough that i can watch my father through the needle ’ s eye as through a lens ground for a butterfly who peers down flower-hallways toward a room shadowed and fathomed as this study ’ s gloom where as a scholar bends above a tomb to read what ’ s buried there he bends to pore over the latin blossom i am four i spill my pins and needles on the floor trying to stitch “ beloved ” x by x. my dangerous bright needle ’ s point connects myself illiterate to this perfect text i can not read my father puzzles why it is my habit to identify carnations as “ christ ’ s flowers ” knowing i can give no explanation but “ because. ” word-roots blossom in speechless messages the way the thread behind my sampler does where following each x i awkward move my needle through the word whose root is love he reads “ a pink variety of clove carnatio the latin meaning flesh. ” as if the bud ’ s essential oils brush christ ’ s fragrance through the room the iron-fresh odor carnations have floats up to me a drifted secret bitter ecstasy the stems squeak in my scissors child it ’ s me he turns the page to “ clove ” and reads aloud “ the clove a spice dried from a flower-bud. ” then twice as if he has n't understood he reads “ from french for clou meaning a nail. ” he gazes motionless “ meaning a nail. ” the incarnation blossoms flesh and nail i twist my threads like stems into a knot and smooth “ beloved ” but my needle caught within the threads thy blood so dearly bought the needle strikes my finger to the bone i lift my hand it is myself i ’ ve sewn the flesh laid bare the threads of blood my own i lift my hand in startled agony and call upon his name “ daddy daddy ” — my father ’ s hand touches the injury as lightly as he touched the page before where incarnation bloomed from roots that bore the flowers i called christ ’ s when i was four

wind whistling as it does in winter and i think nothing of it until it snaps a shutter off her bedroom window spins it over the roof and down to crash on the deck in back like something out of oz we look up stunned—then glad to be safe and have a story characters in a fable we only half-believe look in my surprise i somehow split a wall the last one in the house we ’ re making of gingerbread we ’ ll have to improvise prop the two halves forward like an open double door and with a tube of icing cement them to the floor five days until christmas and the house can not be closed when she peers into the cold interior we ’ ve exposed she half-expects to find three magi in the manger a mother and her child she half-expects to read on tablets of gingerbread a line or two of scripture as she has every morning inside a dated shutter on her advent calendar she takes it from the mantel and coaxes one fingertip under the perforation as if her future hinges on not tearing off the flap under which a thumbnail picture by raphael or giorgione hans memling or david of apses niches archways cradles a smaller scene of a mother and her child of the lidded jewel-box of mary ’ s downcast eyes flee into egypt cries the angel of the lord to joseph in a dream for herod will seek the young child to destroy him while she works to tile the roof with shingled peppermints i wash my sugared hands and step out to the deck to lug the shutter in a page torn from a book still blank for the two of us a mother and her child

the lilacs lift in generous bloom their plumes of dear old-fashioned flowers their fragrance fills the still old house where left alone i count the hours high in the apple-trees the bees are humming busy in the sun — an idle robin cries for rain but once or twice and then is done the sunday-morning quiet holds in heavy slumber all the street while from the church just out of sight behind the elms comes slow and sweet the organ ’ s drone the voices faint that sing the quaint long-meter hymn— i somehow feel as if shut out from some mysterious temple dim and beautiful with blue and red and golden lights from windows high where angels in the shadows stand and earth seems very near the sky the day-dream fades—and so i try again to catch the tune that brings no thought of temple nor of priest but only of a voice that sings

lo praise of the prowess of people-kings of spear-armed danes in days long sped we have heard and what honor the athelings won oft scyld the scefing from squadroned foes from many a tribe the

of combat that all his kin obeyed him gladly till great grew his band of youthful comrades it came in his mind to bid his henchmen a hall uprear a master mead-house mightier far than ever was seen by the sons of earth and within it then to old and young he would all allot that the lord had sent him save only the land and the lives of his men wide i heard was the work commanded for many a tribe this mid-earth round to fashion the folkstead it fell as he ordered in rapid achievement that ready it stood there of halls the noblest heorot he named it whose message had might in many a land not reckless of promise the rings he dealt treasure at banquet there towered the hall high gabled wide the hot surge waiting of furious flame nor far was that day when father and son-in-law stood in feud for warfare and hatred that woke again with envy and anger an evil spirit endured the dole in his dark abode that he heard each day the din of revel high in the hall there harps rang out clear song of the singer he sang who knew tales of the early time of man how the almighty made the earth fairest fields enfolded by water set triumphant sun and moon for a light to lighten the land-dwellers and braided bright the breast of earth with limbs and leaves made life for all of mortal beings that breathe and move so lived the clansmen in cheer and revel a winsome life till one began to fashion

wherever the ring-danes outrevelled to rest had gone found within it the atheling band asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow of human hardship unhallowed wight grim and greedy he grasped betimes wrathful reckless from resting-places thirty of the thanes and thence he rushed fain of his fell spoil faring homeward laden with slaughter his lair to seek then at the dawning as day was breaking the might of grendel to men was known then after wassail was wail uplifted loud moan in the morn the mighty chief atheling excellent unblithe sat labored in woe for the loss of his thanes when once had been traced the trail of the fiend spirit accurst too cruel that sorrow too long too loathsome not late the respite with night returning anew began ruthless murder he recked no whit firm in his guilt of the feud and crime they were easy to find who elsewhere sought in room remote their rest at night bed in the bowers when that bale was shown was seen in sooth with surest token — the hall-thane ’ s hate such held themselves far and fast who the fiend outran thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill one against all until empty stood that lordly building and long it bode so twelve years ’ tide the trouble he bore sovran of scyldings sorrows in plenty boundless cares there came unhidden tidings true to the tribes of men in sorrowful songs how ceaselessly grendel harassed hrothgar what hate he bore him what murder and massacre many a year feud unfading — refused consent to deal with any of daneland ’ s earls make pact of peace or compound for gold still less did the wise men ween to get great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands but the evil one ambushed old and young death-shadow dark and dogged them still lured or lurked in the livelong night of misty moorlands men may say not where the haunts of these hell-runes be such heaping of horrors the hater of men lonely roamer wrought unceasing harassings heavy o ’ er heorot he lorded gold-bright hall in gloomy nights and ne ’ er could the prince approach his throne — ‘ twas judgment of god — or have joy in his hall sore was the sorrow to scyldings ’ -friend heart-rending misery many nobles sat assembled and searched out counsel how it were best for bold-hearted men against harassing terror to try their hand whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes altar-offerings asked with words that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them for the pain of their people their practice this their heathen hope ‘ twas hell they thought of in mood of their mind almighty they knew not doomsman of deeds

him that after death-day may draw to his lord and friendship find in the father ’ s arms thus seethed unceasing the son of healfdene with the woe of these days not wisest men assuaged his sorrow too sore the anguish loathly and long that lay on his folk most baneful of burdens and bales of the night this heard in his home hygelac ’ s thane great among geats of grendel ’ s doings he was the mightiest man of valor in that same day of this our life stalwart and stately a stout wave-walker he bade make ready yon battle-king said he far o ’ er the swan-road he fain would seek the noble monarch who needed men the prince ’ s journey by prudent folk was little blamed though they loved him dear they whetted the hero and hailed good omens and now the bold one from bands of geats comrades chose the keenest of warriors e ’ er he could find with fourteen men the sea-wood he sought and sailor proved led them on to the land ’ s confines time had now flown afloat was the ship boat under bluff on board they climbed warriors ready waves were churning sea with sand the sailors bore on the breast of the bark their bright array their mail and weapons the men pushed off on its willing way the well-braced craft then moved o ’ er the waters by might of the wind that bark like a bird with breast of foam till in season due on the second day the curved prow such course had run that sailors now could see the land sea-cliffs shining steep high hills headlands broad their haven was found their journey ended up then quickly the weders ’ clansmen climbed ashore anchored their sea-wood with armor clashing and gear of battle god they thanked for passing in peace o ’ er the paths of the sea now saw from the cliff a scylding clansman a warden that watched the water-side how they bore o ’ er the gangway glittering shields war-gear in readiness wonder seized him to know what manner of men they were straight to the strand his steed he rode hrothgar ’ s henchman with hand of might he shook his spear and spake in parley “ who are ye then ye armed men mailed folk that yon mighty vessel have urged thus over the ocean ways here o ’ er the waters a warden i sentinel set o ’ er the sea-march here lest any foe to the folk of danes with harrying fleet should harm the land no aliens ever at ease thus bore them linden-wielders yet word-of-leave clearly ye lack from clansmen here my folk ’ s agreement — a greater ne ’ er saw i of warriors in world than is one of you — yon hero in harness no henchman he worthied by weapons if witness his features his peerless presence i pray you though tell your folk and home lest hence ye fare suspect to wander your way as spies in danish land now dwellers afar ocean-travellers take from me simple advice the sooner the better i hear of the country whence ye came. ” to him the stateliest spake in answer the warriors ’ leader his word-hoard unlocked — “ we are by kin of the clan of geats and hygelac ’ s own hearth-fellows we to folk afar was my father known noble atheling ecgtheow named full of winters he fared away aged from earth he is honored still through width of the world by wise men all to thy lord and liege in loyal mood we hasten hither to healfdene ’ s son people-protector be pleased to advise us to that mighty-one come we on mickle errand to the lord of the danes nor deem i right that aught be hidden we hear — thou knowest if sooth it is — the saying of men that amid the scyldings a scathing monster dark ill-doer in dusky nights shows terrific his rage unmatched hatred and murder to hrothgar i in greatness of soul would succor bring so the wise-and-brave may worst his foes — if ever the end of ills is fated of cruel contest if cure shall follow and the boiling care-waves cooler grow else ever afterward anguish-days he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place high on its hill that house unpeered ” astride his steed the strand-ward answered clansman unquailing “ the keen-souled thane must be skilled to sever and sunder duly words and works if he well intends i gather this band is graciously bent to the scyldings ’ master march then bearing weapons and weeds the way i show you i will bid my men your boat meanwhile to guard for fear lest foemen come — your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean faithfully watching till once again it waft o ’ er the waters those well-loved thanes — winding-neck ’ d wood — to weders ’ bounds heroes such as the hest of fate shall succor and save from the shock of war. ” they bent them to march — the boat lay still fettered by cable and fast at anchor broad-bosomed ship — then shone the boars over the cheek-guard chased with gold keen and gleaming guard it kept o ’ er the man of war as marched along heroes in haste till the hall they saw broad of gable and bright with gold that was the fairest ‘ mid folk of earth of houses ‘ neath heaven where hrothgar lived and the gleam of it lightened o ’ er lands afar the sturdy shieldsman showed that bright burg-of-the-boldest bade them go straightway thither his steed then turned hardy hero and hailed them thus — “ tis time that i fare from you father almighty in grace and mercy guard you well safe in your seekings seaward i go ‘ gainst hostile warriors hold my watch. ” stone-bright the street it showed the way to the crowd of clansmen corselets glistened hand-forged hard on their harness bright the steel ring sang as they strode along in mail of battle and marched to the hall there weary of ocean the wall along they set their bucklers their broad shields down and bowed them to bench the breastplates clanged war-gear of men their weapons stacked spears of the seafarers stood together gray-tipped ash that iron band was worthily weaponed — a warrior proud asked of the heroes their home and kin “ whence now bear ye burnished shields harness gray and helmets grim spears in multitude messenger i hrothgar ’ s herald heroes so many ne ’ er met i as strangers of mood so strong ‘ tis plain that for prowess not plunged into exile for high-hearted valor hrothgar ye seek ” him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words proud earl of the weders answer made hardy ‘ neath helmet — ” hygelac ’ s we fellows at board i am beowulf named i am seeking to say to the son of healfdene this mission of mine to thy master-lord the doughty prince if he deign at all grace that we greet him the good one now. ” wulfgar spake the wendles ’ chieftain whose might of mind to many was known his courage and counsel “ the king of danes the scyldings ’ friend i fain will tell the breaker-of-rings as the boon thou askest the famed prince of thy faring hither and swiftly after such answer bring as the doughty monarch may deign to give. ” hied then in haste to where hrothgar sat white-haired and old his earls about him till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there of the danish king good courtier he wulfgar spake to his winsome lord — “ hither have fared to thee far-come men o ’ er the paths of ocean people of geatland and the stateliest there by his sturdy band is beowulf named this boon they seek that they my master may with thee have speech at will nor spurn their prayer to give them hearing gracious hrothgar in weeds of the warrior worthy they methinks of our liking their leader most surely a hero that hither his henchmen has led. ” hrothgar answered helmet of scyldings — “ i knew him of yore in his youthful days his aged father was ecgtheow named to whom at home gave hrethel the geat his only daughter their offspring bold fares hither to seek the steadfast friend and seamen too have said me this — who carried my gifts to the geatish court thither for thanks — he has thirty men ’ s heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand the bold-in-battle blessed god out of his mercy this man hath sent to danes of the west as i ween indeed against horror of grendel i hope to give the good youth gold for his gallant thought be thou in haste and bid them hither clan of kinsmen to come before me and add this word — they are welcome guests to folk of the danes. ” to the door of the hall wulfgar went and the word declared — “ to you this message my master sends east-danes ’ king that your kin he knows hardy heroes and hails you all welcome hither o ’ er waves of the sea ye may wend your way in war-attire and under helmets hrothgar greet but let here the battle-shields bide your parley and wooden war-shafts wait its end. ” uprose the mighty one ringed with his men brave band of thanes some bode without battle-gear guarding as bade the chief then hied that troop where the herald led them under heorot ’ s roof the hero strode hardy ‘ neath helm till the hearth he neared beowulf spake — his breastplate gleamed war-net woven by wit of the smith — “ thou hrothgar hail hygelac ’ s i kinsman and follower fame a plenty have i gained in youth these grendel-deeds i heard in my home-land heralded clear seafarers say how stands this hall of buildings best for your band of thanes empty and idle when evening sun in the harbor of heaven is hidden away so my vassals advised me well — brave and wise the best of men — o sovran hrothgar to seek thee here for my nerve and my might they knew full

and work of wayland fares wyrd as she must. ” hrothgar spake the scyldings ’ -helmet — “ for fight defensive friend my beowulf to succor and save thou hast sought us here thy father ’ s combat a feud enkindled when heatholaf with hand he slew among the wylfings his weder kin for horror of fighting feared to hold him fleeing he sought our south-dane folk over surge of ocean the honor-scyldings when

when the daylight broke all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled gory the hall i had heroes the less doughty dear-ones that death had reft — but sit to the banquet unbind thy words hardy hero as heart shall prompt thee. ” gathered together the geatish men in the banquet-hall on bench assigned sturdy-spirited sat them down hardy-hearted a henchman attended carried the carven cup in hand served the clear mead oft minstrels sang blithe in heorot heroes revelled no dearth of warriors weder and dane unferth spake the son of ecglaf who sat at the feet of the scyldings ’ lord unbound the battle-runes — beowulf ’ s quest sturdy seafarer ’ s sorely galled him ever he envied that other men should more achieve in middle-earth of fame under heaven than he himself — “ art thou that beowulf

brave hast been in struggle grim — if grendel ’ s approach thou darst await through the watch of night ” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ what a deal hast uttered dear my unferth drunken with beer of breca now told of his triumph truth i claim it that i had more of might in the sea than any man else more ocean-endurance we twain had talked in time of youth and made our boast — we were merely boys striplings still — to stake our lives far at sea and so we performed it naked swords as we swam along we held in hand with hope to guard us against the whales not a whit from me could he float afar o ’ er the flood of waves haste o ’ er the billows nor him i abandoned together we twain on the tides abode five nights full till the flood divided us churning waves and chillest weather darkling night and the northern wind ruthless rushed on us rough was the surge now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace yet me ‘ gainst the monsters my mailed coat hard and hand-linked help afforded — battle-sark braided my breast to ward garnished with gold there grasped me firm and haled me to bottom the hated foe with grimmest gripe ‘ twas granted me though to pierce the monster with point of

” joyous then was the jewel-giver hoar-haired war-brave help awaited the bright-danes ’ prince from beowulf hearing folk ’ s good shepherd such firm resolve then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding with winsome words came wealhtheow forth queen of hrothgar heedful of courtesy gold-decked greeting the guests in hall and the high-born lady handed the cup first to the east-danes ’ heir

everywhere carried the cup till come the moment when the ring-graced queen the royal-hearted to beowulf bore the beaker of mead she greeted the geats ’ lord god she thanked in wisdom ’ s words that her will was granted that at last on a hero her hope could lean for comfort in terrors the cup he took hardy-in-war from wealhtheow ’ s hand and answer uttered the eager-for-combat beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ this was my thought when my thanes and i bent to the ocean and entered our boat that i would work the will of your people fully or fighting fall in death in fiend ’ s gripe fast i am firm to do an earl ’ s brave deed or end the days of this life of mine in the mead-hall here. ” well these words to the woman seemed beowulf ’ s battle-boast — bright with gold the stately dame by her spouse sat down again as erst began in hall warriors ’ wassail and words of power the proud-band ’ s revel till presently the son of healfdene hastened to seek rest for the night he knew there waited fight for the fiend in that festal hall when the sheen of the sun they saw no more and dusk of night sank darkling nigh and shadowy shapes came striding on wan under welkin the warriors rose man to man he made harangue hrothgar to beowulf bade him hail let him wield the wine hall a word he added — “ never to any man erst i trusted since i could heave up hand and shield this noble dane-hall till now to thee have now and hold this house unpeered remember thy glory thy might declare watch for the foe no wish shall fail thee if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life. ” then hrothgar went with his hero-train defence-of-scyldings forth from hall fain would the war-lord wealhtheow seek couch of his queen the king-of-glory against this grendel a guard had set so heroes heard a hall-defender who warded the monarch and watched for the monster in truth the geats ’ prince gladly trusted his mettle his might the mercy of god cast off then his corselet of iron helmet from head to his henchman gave — choicest of weapons — the well-chased sword bidding him guard the gear of battle spake then his vaunt the valiant man beowulf geat ere the bed be sought — “ of force in fight no feebler i count me in grim war-deeds than grendel deems him not with the sword then to sleep of death his life will i give though it lie in my power no skill is his to strike against me my shield to hew though he hardy be bold in battle we both this night shall spurn the sword if he seek me here unweaponed for war let wisest god sacred lord on which side soever doom decree as he deemeth right. ” reclined then the chieftain and cheek-pillows held the head of the earl while all about him seamen hardy on hall-beds sank none of them thought that thence their steps to the folk and fastness that fostered them to the land they loved would lead them back full well they wist that on warriors many battle-death seized in the banquet-hall of danish clan but comfort and help war-weal weaving to weder folk the master gave that by might of one over their enemy all prevailed by single strength in sooth ‘ tis told that highest god o ’ er human kind hath wielded ever — thro ’ wan night striding came the walker-in-shadow warriors slept whose hest was to guard the gabled hall — all save one ‘ twas widely known that against god ’ s will the ghostly ravager him could not hurl to haunts of darkness wakeful ready with warrior ’ s wrath bold he bided the battle ’ s issue then from the moorland by misty crags with god ’ s wrath laden grendel came the monster was minded of mankind now sundry to seize in the stately house under welkin he walked till the wine-palace there gold-hall of men he gladly discerned flashing with fretwork not first time this that he the home of hrothgar sought — yet ne ’ er in his life-day late or early such hardy heroes such hall-thanes found to the house the warrior walked apace parted from peace the portal opended though with forged bolts fast when his fists had struck it and baleful he burst in his blatant rage the house ’ s mouth all hastily then o ’ er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on ireful he strode there streamed from his eyes fearful flashes like flame to see he spied in hall the hero-band kin and clansmen clustered asleep hardy liegemen then laughed his heart for the monster was minded ere morn should dawn savage to sever the soul of each life from body since lusty banquet waited his will but wyrd forbade him to seize any more of men on earth after that evening eagerly watched hygelac ’ s kinsman his cursed foe how he would fare in fell attack not that the monster was minded to pause straightway he seized a sleeping warrior for the first and tore him fiercely asunder the bone-frame bit drank blood in streams swallowed him piecemeal swiftly thus the lifeless corse was clear devoured e ’ en feet and hands then farther he hied for the hardy hero with hand he grasped felt for the foe with fiendish claw for the hero reclining — who clutched it boldly prompt to answer propped on his arm soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils that never he met in this middle-world in the ways of earth another wight with heavier hand-gripe at heart he feared sorrowed in soul — none the sooner escaped fain would he flee his fastness seek the den of devils no doings now such as oft he had done in days of old then bethought him the hardy hygelac-thane of his boast at evening up he bounded grasped firm his foe whose fingers cracked the fiend made off but the earl close followed the monster meant — if he might at all — to fling himself free and far away fly to the fens — knew his fingers ’ power in the gripe of the grim one gruesome march to heorot this monster of harm had made din filled the room the danes were bereft castle-dwellers and clansmen all earls of their ale angry were both those savage hall-guards the house resounded wonder it was the wine-hall firm in the strain of their struggle stood to earth the fair house fell not too fast it was within and without by its iron bands craftily clamped though there crashed from sill many a mead-bench — men have told me — gay with gold where the grim foes wrestled so well had weened the wisest scyldings that not ever at all might any man that bone-decked brave house break asunder crush by craft — unless clasp of fire in smoke engulfed it — again uprose din redoubled danes of the north with fear and frenzy were filled each one who from the wall that wailing heard god ’ s foe sounding his grisly song cry of the conquered clamorous pain from captive of hell too closely held him he who of men in might was strongest in that same day of this our life not in any wise would the earls ’ -defence suffer that slaughterous stranger to live useless deeming his days and years to men on earth now many an earl of beowulf brandished blade ancestral fain the life of their lord to shield their praised prince if power were theirs never they knew — as they neared the foe hardy-hearted heroes of war aiming their swords on every side the accursed to kill — no keenest blade no farest of falchions fashioned on earth could harm or hurt that hideous fiend he was safe by his spells from sword of battle from edge of iron yet his end and parting on that same day of this our life woful should be and his wandering soul far off flit to the fiends ’ domain soon he found who in former days harmful in heart and hated of god on many a man such murder wrought that the frame of his body failed him now for him the keen-souled kinsman of hygelac held in hand hateful alive was each to other the outlaw dire took mortal hurt a mighty wound showed on his shoulder and sinews cracked and the bone-frame burst to beowulf now the glory was given and grendel thence death-sick his den in the dark moor sought noisome abode he knew too well that here was the last of life an end of his days on earth — to all the danes by that bloody battle the boon had come from ravage had rescued the roving stranger hrothgar ’ s hall the hardy and wise one had purged it anew his night-work pleased him his deed and its honor to eastern danes had the valiant geat his vaunt made good all their sorrow and ills assuaged their bale of battle borne so long and all the dole they erst endured pain a-plenty — ‘ twas proof of this when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down arm and shoulder — all indeed of grendel ’ s gripe — ‘ neath the gabled roof ’ many at morning as men have told me warriors gathered the gift-hall round folk-leaders faring from far and near o ’ er wide-stretched ways the wonder to view trace of the traitor not troublous seemed the enemy ’ s end to any man who saw by the gait of the graceless foe how the weary-hearted away from thence baffled in battle and banned his steps death-marked dragged to the devils ’ mere bloody the billows were boiling there turbid the tide of tumbling waves horribly seething with sword-blood hot by that doomed one dyed who in den of the moor laid forlorn his life adown his heathen soul -and hell received it home then rode the hoary clansmen from that merry journey and many a youth on horses white the hardy warriors back from the mere then beowulf ’ s glory eager they echoed and all averred that from sea to sea or south or north there was no other in earth ’ s domain under vault of heaven more valiant found of warriors none more worthy to rule on their lord beloved they laid no slight gracious hrothgar a good king he from time to time the tried-in-battle their gray steeds set to gallop amain and ran a race when the road seemed fair from time to time a thane of the king who had made many vaunts and was mindful of verses stored with sagas and songs of old bound word to word in well-knit rime welded his lay this warrior soon of beowulf ’ s quest right cleverly sang and artfully added an excellent tale in well-ranged words of the warlike deeds he had heard in saga of sigemund strange the story he said it all — the waelsing ’ s wanderings wide his struggles which never were told to tribes of men the feuds and the frauds save to fitela only when of these doings he deigned to speak uncle to nephew as ever the twain stood side by side in stress of war and multitude of the monster kind they had felled with their swords of sigemund grew when he passed from life no little praise for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed that herded the hoard under hoary rock the atheling dared the deed alone fearful quest nor was fitela there yet so it befell his falchion pierced that wondrous worm — on the wall it struck best blade the dragon died in its blood thus had the dread-one by daring achieved over the ring-hoard to rule at will himself to pleasure a sea-boat he loaded and bore on its bosom the beaming gold son of waels the worm was consumed he had of all heroes the highest renown among races of men this refuge-of-warriors for deeds of daring that decked his name since the hand and heart of heremod grew slack in battle he swiftly banished to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes to death was betrayed for torrents of sorrow had lamed him too long a load of care to earls and athelings all he proved oft indeed in earlier days for the warrior ’ s wayfaring wise men mourned who had hoped of him help from harm and bale and had thought their sovran ’ s son would thrive follow his father his folk protect the hoard and the stronghold heroes ’ land home of scyldings — but here thanes said the kinsman of hygelac kinder seemed to all the other was urged to crime and afresh to the race the fallow roads by swift steeds measured the morning sun was climbing higher clansmen hastened to the high-built hall those hardy-minded the wonder to witness warden of treasure crowned with glory the king himself with stately band from the bride-bower strode and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens measured the path to the mead-house fair hrothgar spake — to the hall he went stood by the steps the steep roof saw garnished with gold and grendel ’ s hand — “ for the sight i see to the sovran ruler be speedy thanks a throng of sorrows i have borne from grendel but god still works wonder on wonder the warden-of-glory it was but now that i never more for woes that weighed on me waited help long as i lived when laved in blood stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house — widespread woe for wise men all who had no hope to hinder ever foes infernal and fiendish sprites from havoc in hall this hero now by the wielder ’ s might a work has done that not all of us erst could ever do by wile and wisdom lo well can she say whoso of women this warrior bore among sons of men if still she liveth that the god of the ages was good to her in the birth of her bairn now beowulf thee of heroes best i shall heartily love as mine own my son preserve thou ever this kinship new thou shalt never lack wealth of the world that i wield as mine full oft for less have i largess showered my precious hoard on a punier man less stout in struggle thyself hast now fulfilled such deeds that thy fame shall endure through all the ages as ever he did well may the wielder reward thee still ” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ this work of war most willingly we have fought this fight and fearlessly dared force of the foe fain too were i hadst thou but seen himself what time the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall swiftly i thought in strongest gripe on his bed of death to bind him down that he in the hent of this hand of mine should breathe his last but he broke away him i might not — the maker willed not — hinder from flight and firm enough hold the life-destroyer too sturdy was he the ruthless in running for rescue however he left behind him his hand in pledge arm and shoulder nor aught of help could the cursed one thus procure at all none the longer liveth he loathsome fiend sunk in his sins but sorrow holds him tightly grasped in gripe of anguish in baleful bonds where bide he must evil outlaw such awful doom as the mighty maker shall mete him out. ” more silent seemed the son of ecglaf in boastful speech of his battle-deeds since athelings all through the earl ’ s great prowess beheld that hand on the high roof gazing foeman ’ s fingers — the forepart of each of the sturdy nails to steel was likest — heathen ’ s “ hand-spear ” hostile warrior ’ s claw uncanny ‘ twas clear they said that him no blade of the brave could touch how keen soever or cut away that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe there was hurry and hest in heorot now for hands to bedeck it and dense was the throng of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse the guest-room to garnish gold-gay shone the hangings that were wove on the wall and wonders many to delight each mortal that looks upon them though braced within by iron bands that building bright was broken sorely rent were its hinges the roof alone held safe and sound when seared with crime the fiendish foe his flight essayed of life despairing — no light thing that the flight for safety — essay it who will forced of fate he shall find his way to the refuge ready for race of man for soul-possessors and sons of earth and there his body on bed of death shall rest after revel arrived was the hour when to hall proceeded healfdene ’ s son the king himself would sit to banquet ne ’ er heard i of host in haughtier throng more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory fain of the feasting featly received many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall hrothgar and hrothulf heorot now was filled with friends the folk of scyldings ne ’ er yet had tried the traitor ’ s deed to beowulf gave the bairn of healfdene a gold-wove banner guerdon of triumph broidered battle-flag breastplate and helmet and a splendid sword was seen of many borne to the brave one beowulf took cup in hall for such costly gifts he suffered no shame in that soldier throng for i heard of few heroes in heartier mood with four such gifts so fashioned with gold on the ale-bench honoring others thus o ’ er the roof of the helmet high a ridge wound with wires kept ward o ’ er the head lest the relict-of-files should fierce invade sharp in the strife when that shielded hero should go to grapple against his foes then the earls ’ -defence on the floor bade lead coursers eight with carven head-gear adown the hall one horse was decked with a saddle all shining and set in jewels ‘ twas the battle-seat of the best of kings when to play of swords the son of healfdene was fain to fare ne ’ er failed his valor in the crush of combat when corpses fell to beowulf over them both then gave the refuge-of-ingwines right and power o ’ er war-steeds and weapons wished him joy of them manfully thus the mighty prince hoard-guard for heroes that hard fight repaid with steeds and treasures contemned by none who is willing to say the sooth aright and the lord of earls to each that came with beowulf over the briny ways an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave precious gift and the price bade pay in gold for him whom grendel erst murdered — and fain of them more had killed had not wisest god their wyrd averted and the man ’ s brave mood the maker then ruled human kind as here and now therefore is insight always best and forethought of mind how much awaits him of lief and of loath who long time here through days of warfare this world endures then song and music mingled sounds in the presence of healfdene ’ s head-of-armies and harping was heard with the hero-lay as hrothgar ’ s singer the hall-joy woke along the mead-seats making his song of that sudden raid on the sons of finn healfdene ’ s hero hnaef the scylding was fated to fall in the frisian slaughter hildeburh needed not hold in value her enemies ’ honor innocent both were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play bairn and brother they bowed to fate stricken by spears ‘ twas a sorrowful woman none doubted why the daughter of hoc bewailed her doom when dawning came and under the sky she saw them lying kinsmen murdered where most she had kenned of the sweets of the world by

malice of mind bemoan themselves as forced to follow their fee-giver ’ s slayer lordless men as their lot ordained should frisian moreover with foeman ’ s taunt that murderous hatred to mind recall then edge of the sword must seal his doom oaths were given and ancient gold heaped from hoard — the hardy scylding battle-thane best on his balefire lay all on the pyre were plain to see the gory sark the gilded swine-crest boar of hard iron and athelings many slain by the sword at the slaughter they fell it was hildeburh ’ s hest at hnaef ’ s own pyre the bairn of her body on brands to lay his bones to burn on the balefire placed at his uncle ’ s side in sorrowful dirges bewept them the woman great wailing ascended then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires roared o ’ er the hillock heads all were melted gashes burst and blood gushed out from bites of the body balefire devoured greediest spirit those spared not by war out of either folk their flower was gone then hastened those heroes their home to see friendless to find the frisian land houses and high burg hengest still through the death-dyed winter dwelt with finn holding pact yet of home he minded though powerless his

skies that their season ever duly await far off winter was driven fair lay earth ’ s breast and fain was the rover the guest to depart though more gladly he pondered on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep and how to hasten the hot encounter where sons of the frisians were sure to be so he escaped not the common doom when hun with “ lafing ” the light-of-battle best of blades his bosom pierced its edge was famed with the frisian earls on fierce-heart finn there fell likewise on himself at home the horrid sword-death for guthlaf and oslaf of grim attack had sorrowing told from

scylding warriors bore all the chattels the chieftain owned whatever they found in finn ’ s domain of gems and jewels the gentle wife o ’ er paths of the deep to the danes they bore led to her land the lay was finished the gleeman ’ s song then glad rose the revel bench-joy brightened bearers draw from their “ wonder-vats ” wine comes wealhtheow forth under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit uncle and nephew true each to the other one kindred in amity unferth the spokesman at the scylding lord ’ s feet sat men had faith in his spirit his keenness of courage though kinsmen had found him unsure at the sword-play the scylding queen spoke “ quaff of this cup my king and lord breaker of rings and blithe be thou gold-friend of men to the geats here speak such words of mildness as man

then she turned to the seat where her sons were placed hrethric and hrothmund with heroes ’ bairns young men together the geat too sat there beowulf brave the brothers between a cup she gave him with

helpful in deed and uphold his joys here every earl to the other is true mild of mood to the master loyal thanes are friendly the throng obedient liegemen are revelling list and obey ” went then to her place — that was proudest of feasts flowed wine for the warriors wyrd they knew not destiny dire and the doom to be seen by many an earl when eve should come and hrothgar homeward hasten away royal to rest the room was guarded by an army of earls as erst was done they bared the bench-boards abroad they spread beds and bolsters — one beer-carouser in danger of doom lay down in the hall — at their heads they set their shields of war bucklers bright on the bench were there over each atheling easy to see the high battle-helmet the haughty spear the corselet of rings ‘ twas their custom so ever to be for battle prepared at home or harrying which it were even as oft as evil threatened their sovran king — they were clansmen good then sank they to sleep with sorrow one bought his rest of the evening — as ofttime had happened when grendel guarded that golden hall evil wrought till his end drew nigh slaughter for sins ‘ twas seen and told how an avenger survived the fiend as was learned afar the livelong time after that grim fight grendel ’ s mother monster of women mourned her woe she was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters cold sea-courses since cain cut down with edge of the sword his only brother his father ’ s offspring outlawed he fled marked with murder from men ’ s delights warded the wilds — there woke from him such fate-sent ghosts as grendel who war-wolf horrid at heorot found a warrior watching and waiting the fray with whom the grisly one grappled amain but the man remembered his mighty power the glorious gift that god had sent him in his maker ’ s mercy put his trust for comfort and help so he conquered the foe felled the fiend who fled abject reft of joy to the realms of death mankind ’ s foe and his mother now gloomy and grim would go that quest of sorrow the death of her son to avenge to heorot came she where helmeted danes slept in the hall too soon came back old ills of the earls when in she burst the mother of grendel less grim though that terror e ’ en as terror of woman in war is less might of maid than of men in arms when hammer-forged the falchion hard sword gore-stained through swine of the helm crested with keen blade carves amain then was in hall the hard-edge drawn the swords on the settles and shields a-many firm held in hand nor helmet minded nor harness of mail whom that horror seized haste was hers she would hie afar and save her life when the liegemen saw her yet a single atheling up she seized fast and firm as she fled to the moor he was for hrothgar of heroes the dearest of trusty vassals betwixt the seas whom she killed on his couch a clansman famous in battle brave — nor was beowulf there another house had been held apart after giving of gold for the geat renowned — uproar filled heorot the hand all had viewed blood-flecked she bore with her bale was returned dole in the dwellings ‘ twas dire exchange where dane and geat were doomed to give the lives of loved ones long-tried king the hoary hero at heart was sad when he knew his noble no more lived and dead indeed was his dearest thane to his bower was beowulf brought in haste dauntless victor as daylight broke along with his earls the atheling lord with his clansmen came where the king abode waiting to see if the wielder-of-all would turn this tale of trouble and woe strode o ’ er floor the famed-in-strife with his hand-companions — the hall resounded — wishing to greet the wise old king ingwines ’ lord he asked if the night had passed in peace to the prince ’ s mind hrothgar spake helmet-of-scyldings — “ ask not of pleasure pain is renewed to danish folk dead is aeschere of yrmenlaf the elder brother my sage adviser and stay in council shoulder-comrade in stress of fight when warriors clashed and we warded our heads hewed the helm-boars hero famed should be every earl as aeschere was but here in heorot a hand hath slain him of wandering death-sprite i wot not whither proud of the prey her path she took fain of her fill the feud she avenged that yesternight unyieldingly grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst — seeing how long these liegemen mine he ruined and ravaged reft of life in arms he fell now another comes keen and cruel her kin to avenge faring far in feud of blood so that many a thane shall think who e ’ er sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings this is hardest of heart-bales the hand lies low that once was willing each wish to please land-dwellers here and liegemen mine who house by those parts i have heard relate that such a pair they have sometimes seen march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting wandering spirits one of them seemed so far as my folk could fairly judge of womankind and one accursed in man ’ s guise trod the misery-track of exile though huger than human bulk grendel in days long gone they named him folk of the land his father they knew not nor any brood that was born to him of treacherous spirits untrod is their home by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands fenways fearful where flows the stream from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks underground flood not far is it hence in measure of miles that the mere expands and o ’ er it the frost-bound forest hanging sturdily rooted shadows the wave by night is a wonder weird to see fire on the waters so wise lived none of the sons of men to search those depths nay though the heath-rover harried by dogs the horn-proud hart this holt should seek long distance driven his dear life first on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge to hide his head ‘ tis no happy place thence the welter of waters washes up wan to welkin when winds bestir evil storms and air grows dusk and the heavens weep now is help once more with thee alone the land thou knowst not place of fear where thou findest out that sin-flecked being seek if thou dare i will reward thee for waging this fight with ancient treasure as erst i did with winding gold if thou winnest back. ” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “ sorrow not sage it beseems us better friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them each of us all must his end abide in the ways of the world so win who may glory ere death when his days are told that is the warrior ’ s worthiest doom rise o realm-warder ride we anon and mark the trail of the mother of grendel no harbor shall hide her — heed my promise — enfolding of field or forested mountain or floor of the flood let her flee where she will but thou this day endure in patience as i ween thou wilt thy woes each one. ” leaped up the graybeard god he thanked mighty lord for the man ’ s brave words for hrothgar soon a horse was saddled wave-maned steed the sovran wise stately rode on his shield-armed men followed in force the footprints led along the woodland widely seen a path o ’ er the plain where she passed and trod the murky moor of men-at-arms she bore the bravest and best one dead him who with hrothgar the homestead ruled on then went the atheling-born o ’ er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles narrow passes and unknown ways headlands sheer and the haunts of the nicors foremost he fared a few at his side of the wiser men the ways to scan till he found in a flash the forested hill hanging over the hoary rock a woful wood the waves below were dyed in blood the danish men had sorrow of soul and for scyldings all for many a hero ‘ twas hard to bear ill for earls when aeschere ’ s head they found by the flood on the foreland there waves were welling the warriors saw hot with blood but the horn sang oft battle-song bold the band sat down and watched on the water worm-like things sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness — such as oft essay at hour of morn on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest — and sea-snakes and monsters these started away swollen and savage that song to hear that war-horn ’ s blast the warden of geats with bolt from bow then balked of life of wave-work one monster amid its heart went the keen war-shaft in water it seemed less doughty in swimming whom death had seized swift on the billows with boar-spears well hooked and barbed it was hard beset done to death and dragged on the headland wave-roamer wondrous warriors viewed the grisly guest then girt him beowulf in martial mail nor mourned for his life his breastplate broad and bright of hues woven by hand should the waters try well could it ward the warrior ’ s body that battle should break on his breast in vain nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe and the helmet white that his head protected was destined to dare the deeps of the flood through wave-whirl win ‘ twas wound with chains decked with gold as in days of yore the weapon-smith worked it wondrously with swine-forms set it that swords nowise brandished in battle could bite that helm nor was that the meanest of mighty helps which hrothgar ’ s orator offered at need “ hrunting ” they named the hilted sword of old-time heirlooms easily first iron was its edge all etched with poison with battle-blood hardened nor blenched it at fight in hero ’ s hand who held it ever on paths of peril prepared to go to folkstead of foes not first time this it was destined to do a daring task for he bore not in mind the bairn of ecglaf sturdy and strong that speech he had made drunk with wine now this weapon he lent to a stouter swordsman himself though durst not under welter of waters wager his life as loyal liegeman so lost he his glory honor of earls with the other not so who girded him now for the grim encounter beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ have mind thou honored offspring of healfdene gold-friend of men now i go on this quest sovran wise what once was said if in thy cause it came that i should lose my life thou wouldst loyal bide to me though fallen in father ’ s place be guardian thou to this group of my thanes my warrior-friends if war should seize me and the goodly gifts thou gavest me hrothgar beloved to hygelac send geatland ’

sword earl far-honored this heirloom precious hard of edge with hrunting i seek doom of glory or death shall take me. ” after these words the weder-geat lord boldly hastened biding never answer at all the ocean floods closed o ’ er the hero long while of the day fled ere he felt the floor of the sea soon found the fiend who the flood-domain sword-hungry held these hundred winters greedy and grim that some guest from above some man was raiding her monster-realm she grasped out for him with grisly claws and the warrior seized yet scathed she not his body hale the breastplate hindered as she strove to shatter the sark of war the linked harness with loathsome hand then bore this brine-wolf when bottom she touched the lord of rings to the lair she haunted whiles vainly he strove though his valor held weapon to wield against wondrous monsters that sore beset him sea-beasts many tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail and swarmed on the stranger but soon he marked he was now in some hall he knew not which where water never could work him harm nor through the roof could reach him ever fangs of the flood firelight he saw beams of a blaze that brightly shone then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep mere-wife monstrous for mighty stroke he swung his blade and the blow withheld not then sang on her head that seemly blade its war-song wild but the warrior found the light-of-battle was loath to bite to harm the heart its hard edge failed the noble at need yet had known of old strife hand to hand and had helmets cloven doomed men ’ s fighting-gear first time this for the gleaming blade that its glory fell firm still stood nor failed in valor heedful of high deeds hygelac ’ s kinsman flung away fretted sword featly jewelled the angry earl on earth it lay steel-edged and stiff his strength he trusted hand-gripe of might so man shall do whenever in war he weens to earn him lasting fame nor fears for his life seized then by shoulder shrank not from combat the geatish war-prince grendel ’ s mother flung then the fierce one filled with wrath his deadly foe that she fell to ground swift on her part she paid him back with grisly grasp and grappled with him spent with struggle stumbled the warrior fiercest of fighting-men fell adown on the hall-guest she hurled herself hent her short sword broad and brown-edged the bairn to avenge the sole-born son — on his shoulder lay braided breast-mail barring death withstanding entrance of edge or blade life would have ended for ecgtheow ’ s son under wide earth for that earl of geats had his armor of war not aided him battle-net hard and holy god wielded the victory wisest maker the lord of heaven allowed his cause and easily rose the earl erect ‘ mid the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant old-sword of eotens with edge of proof warriors ’ heirloom weapon unmatched — save only ‘ twas more than other men to bandy-of-battle could bear at all — as the giants had wrought it ready and keen seized then its chain-hilt the scyldings ’ chieftain bold and battle-grim brandished the sword reckless of life and so wrathfully smote that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard her bone-rings breaking the blade pierced through that fated-one ’ s flesh to floor she sank bloody the blade he was blithe of his deed then blazed forth light ‘ twas bright within as when from the sky there shines unclouded heaven ’ s candle the hall he scanned by the wall then went he his weapon raised high by its hilts the hygelac-thane angry and eager that edge was not useless to the warrior now he wished with speed grendel to guerdon for grim raids many for the war he waged on western-danes oftener far than an only time when of hrothgar ’ s hearth-companions he slew in slumber in sleep devoured fifteen men of the folk of danes and as many others outward bore his horrible prey well paid for that the wrathful prince for now prone he saw grendel stretched there spent with war spoiled of life so scathed had left him heorot ’ s battle the body sprang far when after death it endured the blow sword-stroke savage that severed its head soon then saw the sage companions who waited with hrothgar watching the flood that the tossing waters turbid grew blood-stained the mere old men together hoary-haired of the hero spake the warrior would not they weened again proud of conquest come to seek their mighty master to many it seemed the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life the ninth hour came the noble scyldings left the headland homeward went the gold-friend of men but the guests sat on stared at the surges sick in heart and wished yet weened not their winsome lord again to see now that sword began from blood of the fight in battle-droppings war-blade to wane ‘ twas a wondrous thing that all of it melted as ice is wont when frosty fetters the father loosens unwinds the wave-bonds wielding all seasons and times the true god he nor took from that dwelling the duke of the geats precious

perished within there soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat downfall of demons up-dove through the flood the clashing waters were cleansed now waste of waves where the wandering fiend her life-days left and this lapsing world swam then to strand the sailors ’ -refuge sturdy-in-spirit of sea-booty glad of burden brave he bore with him went then to greet him and god they thanked the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe that safe and sound they could see him again soon from the hardy one helmet and armor deftly they doffed now drowsed the mere water ‘ neath welkin with war-blood stained forth they fared by the footpaths thence merry at heart the highways measured well-known roads courageous men carried the head from the cliff by the sea an arduous task for all the band the firm in fight since four were needed on the shaft-of-slaughter strenuously to bear to the gold-hall grendel ’ s head so presently to the palace there foemen fearless fourteen geats marching came their master-of-clan mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod strode then within the sovran thane fearless in fight of fame renowned hardy hero hrothgar to greet and next by the hair into hall was borne grendel ’ s head where the henchmen were drinking an awe to clan and queen alike a monster of marvel the men looked on beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ lo now this sea-booty son of healfdene

folk estranged from god eternal whence guerdon due in that waste of waters the wielder paid them so on the guard of shining gold in runic staves it was rightly said for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought best of blades in bygone days and the hilt well wound — the wise-one spake son of healfdene silent were all — “ lo so may he say who sooth and right follows ‘ mid folk of far times mindful

hall rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven blithe-heart boded bright came flying shine after shadow the swordsmen hastened athelings all were eager homeward forth to fare and far from thence the great-hearted guest would guide his keel bade then the hardy-one hrunting be brought to the son of ecglaf the sword bade him take excellent iron and uttered his thanks for it quoth that he counted it keen in battle “ war-friend ” winsome with words he slandered not edge of the blade ‘ twas a big-hearted man now eager for parting and armed at point warriors waited while went to his host that darling of danes the doughty atheling to high-seat hastened and hrothgar greeted beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow — “ lo we seafarers say our will far-come men that we fain would seek hygelac now we here have found hosts to our heart thou hast harbored us well if ever on earth i am able to win me more of thy love o lord of men aught anew than i now have

win thy triumph and lending thee might when thou lackest men if thy hrethric should come to court of geats a sovran ’ s son he will surely there find his friends a far-off land each man should visit who vaunts him brave. ” him then answering hrothgar spake — “ these words of thine the wisest god sent to thy soul no sager counsel from so young in years e ’ er yet have i heard thou art strong of main and in mind art wary art wise in words i ween indeed if ever it hap that hrethel ’ s heir by spear be seized by sword-grim battle by illness or iron thine elder and lord people ’ s leader — and

my landfolk towards friend and foe are firmly joined and honor they keep in the olden way. ” to him in the hall then healfdene ’ s son gave treasures twelve and the trust-of-earls bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved hale to his home and in haste return then kissed the king of kin renowned scyldings ’ chieftain that choicest thane and fell on his neck fast flowed the tears of the hoary-headed heavy with winters he had chances twain but he clung to this — that each should look on the other again and hear him in hall was this hero so dear to him his breast ’ s wild billows he banned in vain safe in his soul a secret longing locked in his mind for that loved man burned in his blood then beowulf strode glad of his gold-gifts the grass-plot o ’ er warrior blithe the wave-roamer bode riding at anchor its owner awaiting as they hastened onward hrothgar ’ s gift they lauded at length — ‘ twas a lord unpeered every way blameless till age had broken it spareth no mortal — his splendid might came now to ocean the ever-courageous hardy henchmen their harness bearing woven war-sarks the warden marked trusty as ever the earl ’ s return from the height of the hill no hostile words reached the guests as he rode to greet them but “ welcome ” he called to that weder clan as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on then on the strand with steeds and treasure and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship was heavily laden high its mast rose over hrothgar ’ s hoarded gems a sword to the boat-guard beowulf gave mounted with gold on the mead-bench since he was better esteemed that blade possessing heirloom old — their ocean-keel boarding they drove through the deep and daneland left a sea-cloth was set a sail with ropes firm to the mast the flood-timbers moaned nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow across from her course the craft sped on foam-necked it floated forth o ’ er the waves keel firm-bound over briny currents till they got them sight of the geatish cliffs home-known headlands high the boat stirred by winds on the strand updrove helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood who long already for loved companions by the water had waited and watched afar he bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship with anchor-bands lest ocean-billows that trusty timber should tear away then beowulf bade them bear the treasure gold and jewels no journey far was it thence to go to the giver of rings hygelac hrethling at home he dwelt by the sea-wall close himself and clan haughty that house a hero the king high the hall and hygd right young

his lot bonds of death and brief the respite soon as they seized him his sword-doom was spoken and the burnished blade a baleful murder proclaimed and closed no queenly way for woman to practise though peerless she that the weaver-of-peace from warrior dear by wrath and lying his life should reave but hemming ’ s kinsman hindered this — for over their ale men also told that of these

sought where since she prospered royal throned rich in goods fain of the fair life fate had sent her and leal in love to the lord of warriors he of all heroes i heard of ever from sea to sea of the

along with sturdy steps to the spot they knew where the battle-king young his burg within slayer of ongentheow shared the rings shelter-of-heroes to hygelac beowulf ’ s coming was quickly told — that there in the court the clansmen ’ s refuge the shield-companion sound and alive hale from the hero-play homeward strode with haste in the hall by highest order room for the rovers was readily made by his sovran he sat come safe from battle kinsman by kinsman his kindly lord he first had greeted in gracious form with manly words the mead dispensing came through the high hall haereth ’ s daughter winsome to warriors wine-cup bore to the hands of the heroes hygelac then his comrade fairly with question plied in the lofty hall sore longing to know what manner of sojourn the sea-geats made “ what came of thy quest my kinsman beowulf when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder battle to seek o ’ er the briny sea combat in heorot hrothgar couldst thou aid at all the honored chief in his wide-known woes with waves of care my sad heart seethed i sore mistrusted my loved one ’ s venture long i begged thee by no means to seek that slaughtering monster but suffer the south-danes to settle their feud themselves with grendel now god be thanked that safe and sound i can see thee now ” beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow — “ ‘ tis known and unhidden hygelac lord to many men that meeting of ours struggle grim between grendel and me which we fought on the field where full too many sorrows he wrought for the scylding-victors evils unending these all i avenged no boast can be from breed of grendel any on earth for that uproar at dawn from the longest-lived of the loathsome race in fleshly fold — but first i went hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts where healfdene ’ s kinsman high-renowned soon as my purpose was plain to him assigned me a seat by his son and heir the liegemen were lusty my life-days never such merry men over mead in hall have i heard under heaven the high-born queen people ’ s peace-bringer passed through the hall cheered the young clansmen clasps of gold ere she sought her seat to sundry gave oft to the heroes hrothgar ’ s daughter to earls in turn the ale-cup tendered — she whom i heard these hall-companions freawaru name when fretted gold she proffered the warriors promised is she gold-decked maid to the glad son of froda sage this seems to the scylding ’ s-friend kingdom ’ s-keeper he counts it wise the woman to wed so and ward off feud store of slaughter but seldom ever when men are slain does the murder-spear sink but briefest while though the bride be fair “ nor haply will like it the heathobard lord and as little each of his liegemen all when a thane of the danes in that doughty throng goes with the lady along their hall and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten hard and ring-decked heathobard ’ s treasure weapons that once they wielded fair until they lost at the linden-play liegeman leal and their lives as well then over the ale on this heirloom gazing some ash-wielder old who has all in mind that spear-death of men — he is stern of mood heavy at heart — in the hero young tests the temper and tries the soul and war-hate wakens with words like these — canst thou not comrade ken that sword which to the fray thy father carried in his final feud ‘ neath the fighting-mask dearest of blades when the danish slew him and wielded the war-place on withergild ’ s fall after havoc of heroes those hardy scyldings now the son of a certain slaughtering dane proud of his treasure paces this hall joys in the killing and carries the jewel that rightfully ought to be owned by thee thus he urges and eggs him all the time with keenest words till occasion offers that freawaru ’ s thane for his father ’ s deed after bite of brand in his blood must slumber losing his life but that liegeman flies living away for the land he kens and thus be broken on both their sides oaths of the earls when ingeld ’ s breast wells with war-hate and wife-love now after the care-billows cooler grows “ so i hold not high the heathobards ’ faith due to the danes or their during love and pact of peace — but i pass from that turning to grendel o giver-of-treasure and saying in full how the fight resulted hand-fray of heroes when heaven ’ s jewel had fled o ’ er far fields that fierce sprite came night-foe savage to seek us out where safe and sound we sentried the hall to hondscio then was that harassing deadly his fall there was fated he first was slain girded warrior grendel on him turned murderous mouth on our mighty kinsman and all of the brave man ’ s body devoured yet none the earlier empty-handed would the bloody-toothed murderer mindful of bale outward go from the gold-decked hall but me he attacked in his terror of might with greedy hand grasped me a glove hung by him wide and wondrous wound with bands and in artful wise it all was wrought by devilish craft of dragon-skins me therein an innocent man the fiendish foe was fain to thrust with many another he might not so when i all angrily upright stood ‘ twere long to relate how that land-destroyer i paid in kind for his cruel deeds yet there my prince this people of thine got fame by my fighting he fled away and a little space his life preserved but there staid behind him his stronger hand left in heorot heartsick thence on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell me for this struggle the scyldings ’ -friend paid in plenty with plates of gold with many a treasure when morn had come and we all at the banquet-board sat down then was song and glee the gray-haired scylding much tested told of the times of yore whiles the hero his harp bestirred wood-of-delight now lays he chanted of sooth and sadness or said aright legends of wonder the wide-hearted king or for years of his youth he would yearn at times for strength of old struggles now stricken with age hoary hero his heart surged full when wise with winters he wailed their flight thus in the hall the whole of that day at ease we feasted till fell o ’ er earth another night anon full ready in greed of vengeance grendel ’ s mother set forth all doleful dead was her son through war-hate of weders now woman monstrous with fury fell a foeman she slew avenged her offspring from aeschere old loyal councillor life was gone nor might they e ’ en when morning broke those danish people their death-done comrade burn with brands on balefire lay the man they mourned under mountain stream she had carried the corpse with cruel hands for hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow of all that had laden the lord of his folk the leader then by thy life besought me sad was his soul in the sea-waves ’ coil to play the hero and hazard my being for glory of prowess my guerdon he pledged i then in the waters — ‘ tis widely known — that sea-floor-guardian savage found hand-to-hand there a while we struggled billows welled blood in the briny hall her head i hewed with a hardy blade from grendel ’ s mother — and gained my life though not without danger my doom was not yet then the haven-of-heroes healfdene ’ s son gave me in guerdon great gifts of price “ so held this king to the customs old that i wanted for nought in the wage i gained the meed of my might he made me gifts healfdene ’ s heir for my own disposal now to thee my prince i proffer them all gladly give them thy grace alone can find me favor few indeed have i of kinsmen save hygelac thee ” then he bade them bear him the boar-head standard the battle-helm high and breastplate gray the splendid sword then spake in form — “ me this war-gear the wise old prince hrothgar gave and his hest he added that its story be straightway said to thee — a while it was held by heorogar king for long time lord of the land of scyldings yet not to his son the sovran left it to daring heoroweard — dear as he was to him his harness of battle — well hold thou it all ” and i heard that soon passed o ’ er the path of this treasure all apple-fallow four good steeds each like the others arms and horses he gave to the king so should kinsmen be not weave one another the net of wiles or with deep-hid treachery death contrive for neighbor and comrade his nephew was ever by hardy hygelac held full dear and each kept watch o ’ er the other ’ s weal i heard too the necklace to hygd he presented wonder-wrought treasure which wealhtheow gave him sovran ’ s daughter three steeds he added slender and saddle-gay since such gift the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen thus showed his strain the son of ecgtheow as a man remarked for mighty deeds and acts of honor at ale he slew not comrade or kin nor cruel his mood though of sons of earth his strength was greatest a glorious gift that god had sent the splendid leader long was he spurned and worthless by geatish warriors held him at mead the master-of-clans failed full oft to favor at all slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him profitless prince but payment came to the warrior honored for all his woes — then the bulwark-of-earls bade bring within hardy chieftain hrethel ’ s heirloom garnished with gold no geat e ’ er knew in shape of a sword a statelier prize the brand he laid in beowulf ’ s lap and of hides assigned him seven thousand with house and high-seat they held in common land alike by their line of birth inheritance home but higher the king because of his rule o ’ er the realm itself now further it fell with the flight of years with harryings horrid that hygelac perished and heardred too by hewing of swords under the shield-wall slaughtered lay when him at the van of his victor-folk sought hardy heroes heatho-scilfings in arms o ’ erwhelming hereric ’ s nephew then beowulf came as king this broad realm to wield and he ruled it well fifty winters a wise old prince warding his land until one began in the dark of night a dragon to rage in the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded in the stone-barrow steep a strait path reached it unknown to mortals some man however came by chance that cave within to the heathen hoard in hand he took a golden goblet nor gave he it back stole with it away while the watcher slept by thievish wiles for the warden ’ s wrath prince and people must pay betimes that way he went with no will of his own in danger of life to the dragon ’ s hoard but for pressure of peril some prince ’ s thane he fled in fear the fatal scourge seeking shelter a sinful man and entered in at the awful sight tottered that guest and terror seized him yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon from fright and fear ere he fled away and took the cup from that treasure-hoard of such besides there was store enough heirlooms old the earth below which some earl forgotten in ancient years left the last of his lofty race heedfully there had hidden away dearest treasure for death of yore had hurried all hence and he alone left to live the last of the clan weeping his friends yet wished to bide warding the treasure his one delight though brief his respite the barrow new-ready to strand and sea-waves stood anear hard by the headland hidden and closed there laid within it his lordly heirlooms and heaped hoard of heavy gold that warden of rings few words he spake “ now hold thou earth since heroes may not what earls have owned lo erst from thee brave men brought it but battle-death seized and cruel killing my clansmen all robbed them of life and a liegeman ’ s joys none have i left to lift the sword or to cleanse the carven cup of price beaker bright my brave are gone and the helmet hard all haughty with gold shall part from its plating polishers sleep who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask and those weeds of war that were wont to brave over bicker of shields the bite of steel rust with their bearer the ringed mail fares not far with famous chieftain at side of hero no harp ’ s delight no glee-wood ’ s gladness no good hawk now flies through the hall nor horses fleet stamp in the burgstead battle and death the flower of my race have reft away. ” mournful of mood thus he moaned his woe alone for them all and unblithe wept by day and by night till death ’ s fell wave o ’ erwhelmed his heart his hoard-of-bliss that old ill-doer open found who blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth naked foe-dragon flying by night folded in fire the folk of earth dread him sore ‘ tis his doom to seek hoard in the graves and heathen gold to watch many-wintered nor wins he thereby powerful this plague-of-the-people thus held the house of the hoard in earth three hundred winters till one aroused wrath in his breast to the ruler bearing that costly cup and the king implored for bond of peace so the barrow was plundered borne off was booty his boon was granted that wretched man and his ruler saw first time what was fashioned in far-off days when the dragon awoke new woe was kindled o ’ er the stone he snuffed the stark-heart found footprint of foe who so far had gone in his hidden craft by the creature ’ s head — so may the undoomed easily flee evils and exile if only he gain the grace of the wielder — that warden of gold o ’ er the ground went seeking greedy to find the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep savage and burning the barrow he circled all without nor was any there none in the waste ... yet war he desired was eager for battle the barrow he entered sought the cup and discovered soon that some one of mortals had searched his treasure his lordly gold the guardian waited ill-enduring till evening came boiling with wrath was the barrow ’ s keeper and fain with flame the foe to pay for the dear cup ’ s loss — now day was fled as the worm had wished by its wall no more was it glad to bide but burning flew folded in flame a fearful beginning for sons of the soil and soon it came in the doom of their lord to a dreadful end then the baleful fiend its fire belched out and bright homes burned the blaze stood high all landsfolk frighting no living thing would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew wide was the dragon ’ s warring seen its fiendish fury far and near as the grim destroyer those geatish people hated and hounded to hidden lair to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn folk of the land it had lapped in flame with bale and brand in its barrow it trusted its battling and bulwarks that boast was vain to beowulf then the bale was told quickly and truly the king ’ s own home of buildings the best in brand-waves melted that gift-throne of geats to the good old man sad in heart ‘ twas heaviest sorrow the sage assumed that his sovran god he had angered breaking ancient law and embittered the lord his breast within with black thoughts welled as his wont was never the folk ’ s own fastness that fiery dragon with flame had destroyed and the stronghold all washed by waves but the warlike king prince of the weders plotted vengeance warriors ’ -bulwark he bade them work all of iron — the earl ’ s commander — a war-shield wondrous well he knew that forest-wood against fire were worthless linden could aid not — atheling brave he was fated to finish this fleeting life his days on earth and the dragon with him though long it had watched o ’ er the wealth of the hoard — shame he reckoned it sharer-of-rings to follow the flyer-afar with a host a broad-flung band nor the battle feared he nor deemed he dreadful the dragon ’ s warring its vigor and valor ventures desperate he had passed a-plenty and perils of war contest-crash since conqueror proud hrothgar ’ s hall he had wholly purged and in grapple had killed the kin of grendel loathsome breed not least was that of hand-to-hand fights where hygelac fell when the ruler of geats in rush of battle lord of his folk in the frisian land son of hrethel by sword-draughts died by brands down-beaten thence beowulf fled through strength of himself and his swimming power though alone and his arms were laden with thirty coats of mail when he came to the sea nor yet might hetwaras haughtily boast their craft of contest who carried against him shields to the fight but few escaped from strife with the hero to seek their homes then swam over ocean ecgtheow ’ s son lonely and sorrowful seeking his land where hygd made him offer of hoard and realm rings and royal-seat reckoning naught the strength of her son to save their kingdom from hostile hordes after hygelac ’ s death no sooner for this could the stricken ones in any wise move that atheling ’ s mind over young heardred ’ s head as lord and ruler of all the realm to be yet the hero upheld him with helpful

that broke the rings in swedish land of the sea-kings ’ line haughty hero hence heardred ’ s end for shelter he gave them sword-death came the blade ’ s fell blow to bairn of hygelac but the son of

eadgils he proved friend to the friendless and forces sent over the sea to the son of ohtere weapons and warriors well repaid he those care-paths cold when the king he slew thus safe through struggles the son of ecgtheow had passed a plenty through perils dire with daring deeds till this day was come that doomed him now with the dragon to strive with comrades eleven the lord of geats swollen in rage went seeking the dragon he had heard whence all the harm arose and the killing of clansmen that cup of price on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder in the throng was this one thirteenth man starter of all the strife and ill care-laden captive cringing thence forced and reluctant he led them on till he came in ken of that cavern-hall the barrow delved near billowy surges flood of ocean within ‘ twas full of wire-gold and jewels a jealous warden warrior trusty the treasures held lurked in his lair not light the task of entrance for any of earth-born men sat on the headland the hero king spake words of hail to his hearth-companions gold-friend of geats all gloomy his soul wavering death-bound wyrd full nigh stood ready to greet the gray-haired man to seize his soul-hoard sunder apart life and body not long would be the warrior ’ s spirit enwound with flesh beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow — “ through store of struggles i strove in youth mighty feuds i mind them all i was seven years old when the sovran of rings friend-of-his-folk from my father took me had me and held me hrethel the king with food and fee faithful in kinship ne ’ er while i lived there he loathlier found me bairn in the burg than his birthright sons herebeald and haethcyn and hygelac mine for the eldest of these by unmeet chance by kinsman ’ s deed was the death-bed strewn when haethcyn killed him with horny bow his own dear liege laid low with an arrow missed the mark and his mate shot down one brother the other with bloody shaft a feeless fight and a fearful sin horror to hrethel yet hard as it was unavenged must the atheling die too awful it is for an aged man to bide and bear that his bairn so young rides on the gallows a rime he makes sorrow-song for his son there hanging as rapture of ravens no rescue now can come from the old disabled man still is he minded as morning breaks of the heir gone elsewhere another he hopes not he will bide to see his burg within as ward for his wealth now the one has found doom of death that the deed incurred forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers reft of revel the rider sleepeth the hero far-hidden no harp resounds in the courts no wassail as once was heard “ then he goes to his chamber a grief-song chants alone for his lost too large all seems homestead and house so the helmet-of-weders hid in his heart for herebeald waves of woe no way could he take to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul nor e ’ en could he harass that hero at all with loathing deed though he loved him not and so for the sorrow his soul endured men ’ s gladness he gave up and god ’ s light chose lands and cities he left his sons as the wealthy do when he went from earth there was strife and struggle ‘ twixt swede and geat o ’ er the width of waters war arose hard battle-horror when hrethel died and ongentheow ’ s offspring grew strife-keen bold nor brooked o ’ er the seas pact of peace but pushed their hosts to harass in hatred by hreosnabeorh men of my folk for that feud had vengeance for woful war ‘ tis widely known though one of them bought it with blood of his heart a bargain hard for haethcyn proved fatal that fray for the first-of-geats at morn i heard was the murderer killed by kinsman for kinsman with clash of sword when ongentheow met eofor there wide split the war-helm wan he fell hoary scylfing the hand that smote him of feud was mindful nor flinched from the death-blow — “ for all that he gave me my gleaming sword repaid him at war — such power i wielded — for lordly treasure with land he entrusted me homestead and house he had no need from swedish realm or from spear-dane folk or from men of the gifths to get him help — some warrior worse for wage to buy ever i fought in the front of all sole to the fore and so shall i fight while i bide in life and this blade shall last that early and late hath loyal proved since for my doughtiness daeghrefn fell slain by my hand the hugas ’ champion nor fared he thence to the frisian king with the booty back and breast-adornments but slain in struggle that standard-bearer fell atheling brave not with blade was he slain but his bones were broken by brawny gripe his heart-waves stilled — the sword-edge now hard blade and my hand for the hoard shall strive. ” beowulf spake and a battle-vow made his last of all “ i have lived through many wars in my youth now once again old folk-defender feud will i seek do doughty deeds if the dark destroyer forth from his cavern come to fight me ” then hailed he the helmeted heroes all for the last time greeting his liegemen dear comrades of war “ i should carry no weapon no sword to the serpent if sure i knew how with such enemy else my vows i could gain as i did in grendel ’ s day but fire in this fight i must fear me now and poisonous breath so i bring with me breastplate and board from the barrow ’ s keeper no footbreadth flee i. one fight shall end our war by the wall as wyrd allots all mankind ’ s master my mood is bold but forbears to boast o ’ er this battling-flyer — now abide by the barrow ye breastplate-mailed ye heroes in harness which of us twain better from battle-rush bear his wounds wait ye the finish the fight is not yours nor meet for any but me alone to measure might with this monster here and play the hero hardily i shall win that wealth or war shall seize cruel killing your king and lord ” up stood then with shield the sturdy champion stayed by the strength of his single manhood and hardy ‘ neath helmet his harness bore under cleft of the cliffs no coward ’ s path soon spied by the wall that warrior chief survivor of many a victory-field where foemen fought with furious clashings an arch of stone and within a stream that broke from the barrow the brooklet ’ s wave was hot with fire the hoard that way he never could hope unharmed to near or endure those deeps for the dragon ’ s flame then let from his breast for he burst with rage the weder-geat prince a word outgo stormed the stark-heart stern went ringing and clear his cry ‘ neath the cliff-rocks gray the hoard-guard heard a human voice his rage was enkindled no respite now for pact of peace the poison-breath of that foul worm first came forth from the cave hot reek-of-fight the rocks resounded stout by the stone-way his shield he raised lord of the geats against the loathed-one while with courage keen that coiled foe came seeking strife the sturdy king had drawn his sword not dull of edge heirloom old and each of the two felt fear of his foe though fierce their mood stoutly stood with his shield high-raised the warrior king as the worm now coiled together amain the mailed-one waited now spire by spire fast sped and glided that blazing serpent the shield protected soul and body a shorter while for the hero-king than his heart desired could his will have wielded the welcome respite but once in his life but wyrd denied it and victory ’ s honors — his arm he lifted lord of the geats the grim foe smote with atheling ’ s heirloom its edge was turned brown blade on the bone and bit more feebly than its noble master had need of then in his baleful stress — then the barrow ’ s keeper waxed full wild for that weighty blow cast deadly flames wide drove and far those vicious fires no victor ’ s glory the geats ’ lord boasted his brand had failed naked in battle as never it should excellent iron — ‘ twas no easy path that ecgtheow ’ s honored heir must tread over the plain to the place of the foe for against his will he must win a home elsewhere far as must all men leaving this lapsing life — not long it was ere those champions grimly closed again the hoard-guard was heartened high heaved his breast once more and by peril was pressed again enfolded in flames the folk-commander nor yet about him his band of comrades sons of athelings armed stood with warlike front to the woods they bent them their lives to save but the soul of one with care was cumbered kinship true can never be marred in a noble mind wiglaf his name was weohstan ’ s son linden-thane loved the lord of scylfings aelfhere ’ s kinsman his king he now saw with heat under helmet hard oppressed he minded the prizes his prince had given him wealthy seat of the waegmunding line and folk-rights that his father owned not long he lingered the linden yellow his shield he seized the old sword he drew — as heirloom of eanmund earth-dwellers knew it who was slain by the sword-edge son of ohtere friendless exile erst in fray killed by weohstan who won for his kin brown-bright helmet breastplate ringed old sword of eotens onela ’ s gift weeds of war of the warrior-thane battle-gear brave though a brother ’ s child had been felled the feud was unfelt by onela for winters this war-gear weohstan kept breastplate and board till his bairn had grown earlship to earn as the old sire did then he gave him mid geats the gear of battle portion huge when he passed from life fared aged forth for the first time now with his leader-lord the liegeman young was bidden to share the shock of battle neither softened his soul nor the sire ’ s bequest weakened in war so the worm found out when once in fight the foes had met wiglaf spake — and his words were sage sad in spirit he said to his comrades — “ i remember the time when mead we took what promise we made to this prince of ours in the banquet-hall to our breaker-of-rings for gear of combat to give him requital for hard-sword and helmet if hap should bring stress of this sort himself who chose us from all his army to aid him now urged us to glory and gave these treasures because he counted us keen with the spear and hardy ‘ neath helm though this hero-work our leader hoped unhelped and alone to finish for us — folk-defender who hath got him glory greater than all men for daring deeds now the day is come that our noble master has need of the might of warriors stout let us stride along the hero to help while the heat is about him glowing and grim for god is my witness i am far more fain the fire should seize along with my lord these limbs of mine unsuiting it seems our shields to bear homeward hence save here we essay to fell the foe and defend the life of the weders ’ lord i wot ‘ twere shame on the law of our land if alone the king out of geatish warriors woe endured and sank in the struggle my sword and helmet breastplate and board for us both shall serve ” through slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain his battle-helm bore and brief words spake — “ beowulf dearest do all bravely as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise thy glory droop now great in deeds atheling steadfast with all thy strength shield thy life i will stand to help thee. ” at the words the worm came once again murderous monster mad with rage with fire-billows flaming its foes to seek the hated men in heat-waves burned that board to the boss and the breastplate failed to shelter at all the spear-thane young yet quickly under his kinsman ’ s shield went eager the earl since his own was now all burned by the blaze the bold king again had mind of his glory with might his glaive was driven into the dragon ’ s head — blow nerved by hate but naegling was shivered broken in battle was beowulf ’ s sword old and gray ‘ twas granted him not that ever the edge of iron at all could help him at strife too strong was his hand so the tale is told and he tried too far with strength of stroke all swords he wielded though sturdy their steel they steaded him nought then for the third time thought on its feud that folk-destroyer fire-dread dragon and rushed on the hero where room allowed battle-grim burning its bitter teeth closed on his neck and covered him with waves of blood from his breast that welled ‘ twas now men say in his sovran ’ s need that the earl made known his noble strain craft and keenness and courage enduring heedless of harm though his hand was burned hardy-hearted he helped his kinsman a little lower the loathsome beast he smote with sword his steel drove in bright and burnished that blaze began to lose and lessen at last the king wielded his wits again war-knife drew a biting blade by his breastplate hanging and the weders ’ -helm smote that worm asunder felled the foe flung forth its life so had they killed it kinsmen both athelings twain thus an earl should be in danger ’ s day — of deeds of valor this conqueror ’ s-hour of the king was last of his work in the world the wound began which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted to swell and smart and soon he found in his breast was boiling baleful and deep pain of poison the prince walked on wise in his thought to the wall of rock then sat and stared at the structure of giants where arch of stone and steadfast column upheld forever that hall in earth yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless lave with water his winsome lord the king and conqueror covered with blood with struggle spent and unspan his helmet beowulf spake in spite of his hurt his mortal wound full well he knew his portion now was past and gone of earthly bliss and all had fled of his file of days and death was near “ i would fain bestow on son of mine this gear of war were given me now that any heir should after me come of my proper blood this people i ruled fifty winters no folk-king was there none at all of the neighboring clans who war would wage me with ‘ warriors ’ -friends ’ and threat me with horrors at home i bided what fate might come and i cared for mine own feuds i sought not nor falsely swore ever on oath for all these things though fatally wounded fain am i from the ruler-of-man no wrath shall seize me when life from my frame must flee away for killing of kinsmen now quickly go and gaze on that hoard ‘ neath the hoary rock wiglaf loved now the worm lies low sleeps heart-sore of his spoil bereaved and fare in haste i would fain behold the gorgeous heirlooms golden store have joy in the jewels and gems lay down softlier for sight of this splendid hoard my life and the lordship i long have held. ” i have heard that swiftly the son of weohstan at wish and word of his wounded king — war-sick warrior — woven mail-coat battle-sark bore ‘ neath the barrow ’ s roof then the clansman keen of conquest proud passing the seat saw store of jewels and glistening gold the ground along by the wall were marvels and many a vessel in the den of the dragon the dawn-flier old unburnished bowls of bygone men reft of richness rusty helms of the olden age and arm-rings many wondrously woven — such wealth of gold booty from barrow can burden with pride each human wight let him hide it who will — his glance too fell on a gold-wove banner high o ’ er the hoard of handiwork noblest brilliantly broidered so bright its gleam all the earth-floor he easily saw and viewed all these vessels no vestige now was seen of the serpent the sword had ta ’ en him then i heard the hill of its hoard was reft old work of giants by one alone he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate at his own good will and the ensign took brightest of beacons — the blade of his lord — its edge was iron — had injured deep one that guarded the golden hoard many a year and its murder-fire spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows at midnight hour till it met its doom hasted the herald the hoard so spurred him his track to retrace he was troubled by doubt high-souled hero if haply he ’ d find alive where he left him the lord of weders weakening fast by the wall of the cave so he carried the load his lord and king he found all bleeding famous chief at the lapse of life the liegeman again plashed him with water till point of word broke through the breast-hoard beowulf spake sage and sad as he stared at the gold — “ for the gold and treasure to god my thanks to the wielder-of-wonders with words i say for what i behold to heaven ’ s lord for the grace that i give such gifts to my folk or ever the day of my death be run now i ’ ve bartered here for booty of treasure the last of my life so look ye well to the needs of my land no longer i tarry a barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise for my ashes ‘ twill shine by the shore of the flood to folk of mine memorial fair on hrones headland high uplifted that ocean-wanderers oft may hail beowulf ’ s barrow as back from far they drive their keels o ’ er the darkling wave. ” from his neck he unclasped the collar of gold valorous king to his vassal gave it with bright-gold helmet breastplate and ring to the youthful thane bade him use them in joy “ thou art end and remnant of all our race the waegmunding name for wyrd hath swept them all my line to the land of doom earls in their glory i after them go. ” this word was the last which the wise old man harbored in heart ere hot death-waves of balefire he chose from his bosom fled his soul to seek the saints ’ reward it was heavy hap for that hero young on his lord beloved to look and find him lying on earth with life at end sorrowful sight but the slayer too awful earth-dragon empty of breath lay felled in fight nor fain of its treasure could the writhing monster rule it more for edges of iron had ended its days hard and battle-sharp hammers ’ leaving and that flier-afar had fallen to ground hushed by its hurt its hoard all near no longer lusty aloft to whirl at midnight making its merriment seen proud of its prizes prone it sank by the handiwork of the hero-king forsooth among folk but few achieve — though sturdy and strong as stories tell me and never so daring in deed of valor — the perilous breath of a poison-foe to brave and to rush on the ring-board hall whenever his watch the warden keeps bold in the barrow beowulf paid the price of death for that precious hoard and each of the foes had found the end of this fleeting life befell erelong that the laggards in war the wood had left trothbreakers cowards ten together fearing before to flourish a spear in the sore distress of their sovran lord now in their shame their shields they carried armor of fight where the old man lay and they gazed on wiglaf wearied he sat at his sovran ’ s shoulder shieldsman good to wake him with water nowise it availed though well he wished it in world no more could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles nor baffle the will of all-wielding god doom of the lord was law o ’ er the deeds of every man as it is to-day grim was the answer easy to get from the youth for those that had yielded to fear wiglaf spake the son of weohstan — mournful he looked on those men unloved — “ who sooth will speak can say indeed that the ruler who gave you golden rings and the harness of war in which ye stand — for he at ale-bench often-times bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate lord to liegemen the likeliest gear which near of far he could find to give — threw away and wasted these weeds of battle on men who failed when the foemen came not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms venture to vaunt though the victory-wielder god gave him grace that he got revenge sole with his sword in stress and need to rescue his life ‘ twas little that i could serve him in struggle yet shift i made hopeless it seemed to help my kinsman its strength ever waned when with weapon i struck that fatal foe and the fire less strongly flowed from its head — too few the heroes in throe of contest that thronged to our king now gift of treasure and girding of sword joy of the house and home-delight shall fail your folk his freehold-land every clansman within your kin shall lose and leave when lords highborn hear afar of that flight of yours a fameless deed yea death is better for liegemen all than a life of shame ” that battle-toil bade he at burg to announce at the fort on the cliff where full of sorrow all the morning earls had sat daring shieldsmen in doubt of twain would they wail as dead or welcome home their lord beloved little kept back of the tidings new but told them all the herald that up the headland rode — “ now the willing-giver to weder folk in death-bed lies the lord of geats on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent ’ s deed and beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men with knife-wounds sick no sword availed on the awesome thing in any wise to work a wound there wiglaf sitteth weohstan ’ s bairn by beowulf ’ s side the living earl by the other dead and heavy of heart a head-watch keeps o ’ er friend and foe — now our folk may look for waging of war when once unhidden to frisian and frank the fall of the king is spread afar — the strife began when hot on the hugas hygelac fell and fared with his fleet to the frisian land him there the hetwaras humbled in war plied with such prowess their power o ’ erwhelming that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it and fell in fight to his friends no wise could that earl give treasure and ever since the merowings ’ favor has failed us wholly nor aught expect i of peace and faith from swedish folk ‘ twas spread afar how ongentheow reft at ravenswood haethcyn hrethling of hope and life when the folk of geats for the first time sought in wanton pride the warlike-scylfings soon the sage old sire of ohtere ancient and awful gave answering blow the sea-king he slew and his spouse redeemed his good wife rescued though robbed of her gold mother of ohtere and onela then he followed his foes who fled before him sore beset and stole their way bereft of a ruler to ravenswood with his host he besieged there what swords had left the weary and wounded woes he threatened the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng some with the morrow his sword should kill some should go to the gallows-tree for rapture of ravens but rescue came with dawn of day for those desperate men when they heard the horn of hygelac sound tones of his trumpet the trusty king had followed their trail with faithful band the bloody swath of swedes and geats and the storm of their strife were seen afar how folk against folk the fight had wakened the ancient king with his atheling band sought his citadel sorrowing much ongentheow earl went up to his burg he had tested hygelac ’ s hardihood the proud one ’ s prowess would prove it no longer defied no more those fighting-wanderers nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard his bairn and his bride so he bent him again old to his earth-walls yet after him came with slaughter for swedes the standards of hygelac o ’ er peaceful plains in pride advancing till hrethelings fought in the fenced town then ongentheow with edge of sword the hoary-bearded was held at bay and the folk-king there was forced to suffer eofor ’ s anger in ire at the king wulf wonreding with weapon struck and the chieftain ’ s blood for that blow in streams flowed ‘ neath his hair no fear felt he stout old scylfing but straightway repaid in better bargain that bitter stroke and faced his foe with fell intent nor swift enough was the son of wonred answer to render the aged chief too soon on his head the helm was cloven blood-bedecked he bowed to earth and fell adown not doomed was he yet and well he waxed though the wound was sore then the hardy hygelac-thane when his brother fell with broad brand smote giants ’ sword crashing through giants ’ -helm across the shield-wall sank the king his folk ’ s old herdsman fatally hurt there were many to bind the brother ’ s wounds and lift him fast as fate allowed his people to wield the place-of-war but eofor took from ongentheow earl from other the iron-breastplate hard sword hilted and helmet too and the hoar-chief ’ s harness to hygelac carried who took the trappings and truly promised rich fee ‘ mid folk — and fulfilled it so for that grim strife gave the geatish lord hrethel ’ s offspring when home he came to eofor and wulf a wealth of treasure each of them had a hundred thousand in land and linked rings nor at less price reckoned mid-earth men such mighty deeds and to eofor he gave his only daughter in pledge of grace the pride of his home “ such is the feud the foeman ’ s rage death-hate of men so i deem it sure that the swedish folk will seek us home for this fall of their friends the fighting-scylfings when once they learn that our warrior leader lifeless lies who land and hoard ever defended from all his foes furthered his folk ’ s weal finished his course a hardy hero — now haste is best that we go to gaze on our geatish lord and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings to the funeral pyre no fragments merely shall burn with the warrior wealth of jewels gold untold and gained in terror treasure at last with his life obtained all of that booty the brands shall take fire shall eat it no earl must carry memorial jewel no maiden fair shall wreathe her neck with noble ring nay sad in spirit and shorn of her gold oft shall she pass o ’ er paths of exile now our lord all laughter has laid aside all mirth and revel many a spear morning-cold shall be clasped amain lifted aloft nor shall lilt of harp those warriors wake but the wan-hued raven fain o ’ er the fallen his feast shall praise and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate when he and the wolf were wasting the slain. ” so he told his sorrowful tidings and little he lied the loyal man of word or of work the warriors rose sad they climbed to the cliff-of-eagles went welling with tears the wonder to view found on the sand there stretched at rest their lifeless lord who had lavished rings of old upon them ending-day had dawned on the doughty-one death had seized in woful slaughter the weders ’ king there saw they besides the strangest being loathsome lying their leader near prone on the field the fiery dragon fearful fiend with flame was scorched reckoned by feet it was fifty measures in length as it lay aloft erewhile it had revelled by night and anon come back seeking its den now in death ’ s sure clutch it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys by it there stood the stoups and jars dishes lay there and dear-decked swords eaten with rust as on earth ’ s lap resting a thousand winters they waited there for all that heritage huge that gold of bygone men was bound by a spell so the treasure-hall could be touched by none of human kind — save that heaven ’ s king god himself might give whom he would helper of heroes the hoard to open — even such a man as seemed to him meet a perilous path it proved he trod who heinously hid that hall within wealth under wall its watcher had killed one of a few and the feud was avenged in woful fashion wondrous seems it what manner a man of might and valor oft ends his life when the earl no longer in mead-hall may live with loving friends so beowulf when that barrow ’ s warden he sought and the struggle himself knew not in what wise he should wend from the world at last for princes potent who placed the gold with a curse to doomsday covered it deep so that marked with sin the man should be hedged with horrors in hell-bonds fast racked with plagues who should rob their hoard yet no greed for gold but the grace of heaven ever the king had kept in view wiglaf spake the son of weohstan — “ at the mandate of one oft warriors many sorrow must suffer and so must we the people ’ s-shepherd showed not aught of care for our counsel king beloved that guardian of gold he should grapple not urged we but let him lie where he long had been in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world the hest of heaven — this hoard is ours but grievously gotten too grim the fate which thither carried our king and lord i was within there and all i viewed the chambered treasure when chance allowed me and my path was made in no pleasant wise under the earth-wall eager i seized such heap from the hoard as hands could bear and hurriedly carried it hither back to my liege and lord alive was he still still wielding his wits the wise old man spake much in his sorrow and sent you greetings and bade that ye build when he breathed no more on the place of his balefire a barrow high memorial mighty of men was he worthiest warrior wide earth o ’ er the while he had joy of his jewels and burg let us set out in haste now the second time to see and search this store of treasure these wall-hid wonders — the way i show you — where gathered near ye may gaze your fill at broad-gold and rings let the bier soon made be all in order when out we come our king and captain to carry thither — man beloved — where long he shall bide safe in the shelter of sovran god. ” then the bairn of weohstan bade command hardy chief to heroes many that owned their homesteads hither to bring firewood from far — o ’ er the folk they ruled — for the famed-one ’ s funeral “ fire shall devour and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior who oft stood stout in the iron-shower when sped from the string a storm of arrows shot o ’ er the shield-wall the shaft held firm featly feathered followed the barb. ” and now the sage young son of weohstan seven chose of the chieftain ’ s thanes the best he found that band within and went with these warriors one of eight under hostile roof in hand one bore a lighted torch and led the way no lots they cast for keeping the hoard when once the warriors saw it in hall altogether without a guardian lying there lost and little they mourned when they had hastily haled it out dear-bought treasure the dragon they cast the worm o ’ er the wall for the wave to take and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems then the woven gold on a wain was laden — countless quite — and the king was borne hoary hero to hrones-ness then fashioned for him the folk of geats firm on the earth a funeral-pile and hung it with helmets and harness of war and breastplates bright as the boon he asked and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain heroes mourning their master dear then on the hill that hugest of balefires the warriors wakened wood-smoke rose black over blaze and blent was the roar of flame with weeping the wind was still till the fire had broken the frame of bones hot at the heart in heavy mood their misery moaned they their master ’ s death wailing her woe the widow old her hair upbound for beowulf ’ s death sung in her sorrow and said full oft she dreaded the doleful days to come deaths enow and doom of battle and shame — the smoke by the sky was devoured the folk of the weders fashioned there on the headland a barrow broad and high by ocean-farers far descried in ten days ’ time their toil had raised it the battle-brave ’ s beacon round brands of the pyre a wall they built the worthiest ever that wit could prompt in their wisest men they placed in the barrow that precious booty the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile hardy heroes from hoard in cave — trusting the ground with treasure of earls gold in the earth where ever it lies useless to men as of yore it was then about that barrow the battle-keen rode atheling-born a band of twelve lament to make to mourn their king chant their dirge and their chieftain honor they praised his earlship his acts of prowess worthily witnessed and well it is that men their master-friend mightily laud heartily love when hence he goes from life in the body forlorn away thus made their mourning the men of geatland for their

i immense august like some titanic bloom the mighty choir unfolds its lithic core petalled with panes of azure gules and or splendidly lambent in the gothic gloom and stamened with keen flamelets that illume the pale high-altar on the prayer-worn floor by worshippers innumerous thronged of yore a few brown crones familiars of the tomb the stranded driftwood of faith ’ s ebbing sea— for these alone the finials fret the skies the topmost bosses shake their blossoms free while from the triple portals with grave eyes tranquil and fixed upon eternity the cloud of witnesses still testifies ii the crimson panes like blood-drops stigmatise the western floor the aisles are mute and cold a rigid fetich in her robe of gold the virgin of the pillar with blank eyes enthroned beneath her votive canopies gathers a meagre remnant to her fold the rest is solitude the church grown old stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies well-nigh again its mighty framework grows to be a part of nature ’ s self withdrawn from hot humanity ’ s impatient woes the floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn and in the east one giant window shows the roseate coldness of an alp at dawn
oh dear the christian virtues will disappear nowhere on land or sea will be room for charity nowhere in field or city a person to help or pity better for them no doubt not to need helping out of their old miry ditch but alas for us the rich for we shall lose you see our boasted charity — lose all the pride and joy of giving the poor employ and money and food and love and making stock thereof our christian virtues are gone with nothing to practise on it don ’ t hurt them a bit for they can ’ t practise it but it ’ s our great joy and pride— what virtue have we beside we believe as sure as we live that it is more blessed to give than to want and waste and grieve and occasionally receive and here are the people pressing to rob us of our pet blessing no chance to endow or bedizen a hospital school or prison and leave our own proud name to gratitude and fame no chance to do one good deed to give what we do not need to leave what we can not use to those whom we deign to choose when none want broken meat how shall our cake be sweet when none want flannels and coals how shall we save our souls oh dear oh dear the christian virtues will disappear the poor have their virtues rude — meekness and gratitude endurance and respect for us the world ’ s elect economy self-denial patience in every trial self-sacrifice self-restraint — virtues enough for a saint virtues enough to bear all this life ’ s sorrow and care virtues by which to rise to a front seat in the skies how can they turn from this to common earthly bliss — mere clothes and food and drink and leisure to read and think and art and beauty and ease — there is no crown for these true if their gratitude were not for fire and food they might still learn to bless the lord for their happiness and instead of respect for wealth might learn from beauty and health and freedom in power and pelf each man to respect himself and instead of scraping and saving might learn from using and having that man ’ s life should be spent in a grand development but this is petty and small these are not virtues at all they do not look as they should they don ’ t do us any good oh dear oh dear oh dear the christian virtues will disappear
where is my boy my boy— in what far part of the world the boy i loved best of all in the school — i the teacher the old maid the virgin heart who made them all my children did i know my boy aright thinking of him as spirit aflame active ever aspiring oh boy boy for whom i prayed and prayed in many a watchful hour at night do you remember the letter i wrote you of the beautiful love of christ and whether you ever took it or not my boy wherever you are work for your soul ’ s sake that all the clay of you all the dross of you may yield to the fire of you till the fire is nothing but light nothing but light
composed at clevedon somersetshire my pensive sara thy soft cheek reclined thus on mine arm most soothing sweet it is to sit beside our cot our cot o ’ ergrown with white-flowered jasmin and the broad-leaved myrtle meet emblems they of innocence and love and watch the clouds that late were rich with light slow saddening round and mark the star of eve serenely brilliant such would wisdom be shine opposite how exquisite the scents snatched from yon bean-field and the world so hushed the stilly murmur of the distant sea tells us of silence and that simplest lute placed length-ways in the clasping casement hark how by the desultory breeze caressed like some coy maid half yielding to her lover it pours such sweet upbraiding as must needs tempt to repeat the wrong and now its strings boldlier swept the long sequacious notes over delicious surges sink and rise such a soft floating witchery of sound as twilight elfins make when they at eve voyage on gentle gales from fairy-land where melodies round honey-dropping flowers footless and wild like birds of paradise nor pause nor perch hovering on untamed wing o the one life within us and abroad which meets all motion and becomes its soul a light in sound a sound-like power in light rhythm in all thought and joyance everywhere— methinks it should have been impossible not to love all things in a world so filled where the breeze warbles and the mute still air is music slumbering on her instrument and thus my love as on the midway slope of yonder hill i stretch my limbs at noon whilst through my half-closed eyelids i behold the sunbeams dance like diamonds on the main and tranquil muse upon tranquility full many a thought uncalled and undetained and many idle flitting phantasies traverse my indolent and passive brain as wild and various as the random gales that swell and flutter on this subject lute and what if all of animated nature be but organic harps diversely framed that tremble into thought as o ’ er them sweeps plastic and vast one intellectual breeze at once the soul of each and god of all but thy more serious eye a mild reproof darts o beloved woman nor such thoughts dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject and biddest me walk humbly with my god meek daughter in the family of christ well hast thou said and holily dispraised these shapings of the unregenerate mind bubbles that glitter as they rise and break on vain philosophy ’ s aye-babbling spring for never guiltless may i speak of him the incomprehensible save when with awe i praise him and with faith that inly feels who with his saving mercies healèd me a sinful and most miserable man wildered and dark and gave me to possess peace and this cot and thee heart-honored maid
stop christian passer-by —stop child of god and read with gentle breast beneath this sod a poet lies or that which once seemed he o lift one thought in prayer for s. t. c. that he who many a year with toil of breath found death in life may here find life in death mercy for praise—to be forgiven for fame he asked and hoped through christ do thou the same
to mrs. fry in newgate sermons in stones.—as you like it out out damned spot.—macbeth i like you mrs. fry i like your name it speaks the very warmth you feel in pressing in daily act round charity ’ s great flame— i like the crisp browne way you have of dressing good mrs. fry i like the placid claim you make to christianity —professing love and good works—of course you buy of barton beside the young fry ’ s bookseller friend darton i like good mrs. fry your brethren mute— those serious solemn gentlemen that sport— i should have said that wear the sober suit shap ’ d like a court dress—but for heaven ’ s court i like your sisters too —sweet rachel ’ s fruit— protestant nuns i like their stiff support of virtue—and i like to see them clad with such a difference—just like good from bad i like the sober colors—not the wet those gaudy manufactures of the rainbow— green orange crimson purple violet— in which the fair the flirting and the vain go— the others are a chaste severer set in which the good the pious and the plain go— they ’ re moral standards to know christians by— in short they are your colours mrs. fry as for the naughty tinges of the prism— crimson ’ s the cruel uniform of war— blue—hue of brimstone minds no catechism and green is young and gay—not noted for goodness or gravity or quietism till it is sadden ’ d down to tea-green or olive—and purple ’ s giv ’ n to wine i guess and yellow is a convict by its dress they ’ re all the devil ’ s liveries that men and women wear in servitude to sin— but how will they come off poor motleys when sin ’ s wages are paid down and they stand in the evil presence you and i know then how all the party colours will begin to part—the pittite hues will sadden there whereas the foxite shades will all show fair witness their goodly labors one by one russet makes garments for the needy poor— dove-colour preaches love to all—and dun calls every day at charity ’ s street door— brown studies scripture and bids woman shun all gaudy furnishing—olive doth pour oil into wounds and drab and slate supply scholar and book in newgate mrs. fry well heaven forbid that i should discommend the gratis charitable jail-endeavor when all persuasions in your praises blend— the methodist ’ s creed and cry are fry for ever no—i will be your friend—and like a friend point out your very worst defect—nay never start at that word —but i must ask you why you keep your school in newgate mrs. fry too well i know the price our mother eve paid for her schooling but must all her daughters commit a petty larceny and thieve— pay down a crime for “ entrance ” to your “ quarters ” your classes may increase but i must grieve over your pupils at their bread and waters oh tho ’ it cost you rent— and rooms run high keep your school out of newgate mrs. fry o save the vulgar soul before it ’ s spoil ’ d set up your mounted sign without the gate— and there inform the mind before ’ tis soil ’ d ’ tis sorry writing on a greasy slate nay if you would not have your labors foil ’ d take it inclining tow ’ rds a virtuous state not prostrate and laid flat—else woman meek the upright pencil will but hop and shriek ah who can tell how hard it is to drain the evil spirit from the heart it preys in — to bring sobriety to life again chok ’ d with the vile anacreontic raisin — to wash black betty when her black ’ s ingrain — to stick a moral lacquer on moll brazen of suky tawdry ’ s habits to deprive her to tame the wild-fowl-ways of jenny diver ah who can tell how hard it is to teach miss nancy dawson on her bed of straw— to make long sal sew up the endless breach she made in manners—to write heaven ’ s own law on hearts of granite.—nay how hard to preach in cells that are not memory ’ s—to draw the moral thread thro ’ the immoral eye of blunt whitechapel natures mrs. fry in vain you teach them baby-work within ’ tis but a clumsy botchery of crime ’ tis but a tedious darning of old sin— come out yourself and stitch up souls in time— it is too late for scouring to begin when virtue ’ s ravell ’ d out when all the prime is worn away and nothing sound remains you ’ ll fret the fabric out before the stains i like your chocolate good mistress fry i like your cookery in every way i like your shrove-tide service and supply i like to hear your sweet pandeans play i like the pity in your full-brimm ’ d eye i like your carriage and your silken grey your dove-like habits and your silent preaching but i don ’ t like your newgatory teaching come out of newgate mrs. fry repair abroad and find your pupils in the streets o come abroad into the wholesome air and take your moral place before sin seats her wicked self in the professor ’ s chair suppose some morals raw the true receipt ’ s to dress them in the pan but do not try to cook them in the fire good mrs. fry put on your decent bonnet and come out good lack the ancients did not set up schools in jail—but at the porch hinting no doubt that vice should have a lesson in the rules before ’ twas whipt by law.—o come about good mrs. fry and set up forms and stools all down the old bailey and thro ’ newgate-street but not in mr. wontner ’ s proper seat teach lady barrymore if teaching you that peerless peeress can absolve from dolour teach her it is not virtue to pursue ruin of blue or any other colour teach her it is not virtue ’ s crown to rue month after month the unpaid drunken dollar teach her that “ flooring charleys ” is a game unworthy one that bears a christian name o come and teach our children—that ar ’ n ’ t ours— that heaven ’ s straight pathway is a narrow way not broad st. giles ’ s where fierce sin devours children like time—or rather they both prey on youth together—meanwhile newgate low ’ rs ev ’ n like a black cloud at the close of day to shut them out from any more blue sky think of these hopeless wretches mrs. fry you are not nice—go into their retreats and make them quakers if you will.— ’ twere best they wore straight collars and their shirts sans pleats that they had hats with brims —that they were drest in garbs without lappels—than shame the streets with so much raggedness.—you may invest much cash this way—but it will cost its price to give a good round real cheque to vice in brief —oh teach the child its moral rote not in the way from which it won ’ t depart — but out—out—out oh bid it walk remote and if the skies are clos ’ d against the smart ev ’ n let him wear the single-breasted coat for that ensureth singleness of heart.— do what you will his every want supply keep him—but out of newgate

i am a bold coachman and drive a good hack with a coat of five capes that quite covers my back and my wife keeps a sausage-shop not many miles from the narrowest alley in all broad st giles though poor we are honest and very content we pay as we go for meat drink and for rent to work all the week i am able and willing i never get drunk and i waste not a shilling and while at a tavern my gentleman tarries the coachman grows richer than he whom he carries and i ’ d rather said i since it saves me from sin be the driver without than the toper within yet though dram-shops i hate and the dram-drinking friend i ’ m not quite so good but i wish i may mend i repent of my sins since we all are depraved for a coachman i hold has a soul to be saved when a riotous multitude fills up a street and the greater part know not boys wherefore they meet if i see there is mischief i never go there let others get tipsy so i get my fare now to church if i take some good lady to pray it grieves me full sore to be kept quite away so i step within side though the sermon ’ s begun for a slice of the service is better than none then my glasses are whole and my coach is so neat i am always the first to be called in the street and i ’ m known by the name ’ tis a name rather rare of the coachman that never asks more than his fare though my beasts should be dull yet i don ’ t use them ill though they stumble i swear not nor cut them up hill for i firmly believe there ’ s no charm in an oath that can make a nag trot when to walk he is loath and though i ’ m a coachman i ’ ll freely confess i beg of my maker my labours to bless i praise him each morning and pray every night and ’ tis this makes my heart feel so cheerful and light when i drive to a funeral i care not for drink that is not the moment to guzzle but think and i wish i could add both of coachman and master that both of us strove to amend a bit faster

go your seeking soul mine the proven path of time ’ s foretelling yours accordance with some mysteried whole i am but your passion-haunted dwelling bring what news you can stranger loved of body ’ s humbled heart say one whispered word to mortal man from that peace whereof he claims you part hither-hence my guest blood and bone befriend where you abide till withdrawn to share some timeless quest i am but the brain that dreamed and died
i heard a fly buzz when i died the stillness in the room was like the stillness in the air between the heaves of storm the eyes around had wrung them dry and breaths were gathering firm for that last onset when the king be witnessed in the room i willed my keepsakes signed away what portion of me be assignable and then it was there interposed a fly with blue uncertain stumbling buzz between the light and me and then the windows failed and then i could not see to see
i remember i remember the house where i was born the little window where the sun came peeping in at morn he never came a wink too soon nor brought too long a day but now i often wish the night had borne my breath away i remember i remember the roses red and white the vi'lets and the lily-cups those flowers made of light the lilacs where the robin built and where my brother set the laburnum on his birthday — the tree is living yet i remember i remember where i was used to swing and thought the air must rush as fresh to swallows on the wing my spirit flew in feathers then that is so heavy now and summer pools could hardly cool the fever on my brow i remember i remember the fir trees dark and high i used to think their slender tops were close against the sky it was a childish ignorance but now 't is little joy to know i 'm farther off from heav'n than when i was a boy
in spite of all the learned have said i still my old opinion keep the posture that we give the dead points out the soul 's eternal sleep not so the ancients of these lands— the indian when from life released again is seated with his friends and shares again the joyous feast his imaged birds and painted bowl and venison for a journey dressed bespeak the nature of the soul activity that knows no rest his bow for action ready bent and arrows with a head of stone can only mean that life is spent and not the old ideas gone thou stranger that shalt come this way no fraud upon the dead commit— observe the swelling turf and say they do not lie but here they sit here still a lofty rock remains on which the curious eye may trace now wasted half by wearing rains the fancies of a ruder race here still an aged elm aspires beneath whose far-projecting shade and which the shepherd still admires the children of the forest played there oft a restless indian queen pale shebah with her braided hair and many a barbarous form is seen to chide the man that lingers there by midnight moons o'er moistening dews in habit for the chase arrayed the hunter still the deer pursues the hunter and the deer a shade and long shall timorous fancy see the painted chief and pointed spear and reason 's self shall bow the knee to shadows and delusions here
out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not winced nor cried aloud under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody but unbowed beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid it matters not how strait the gate how charged with punishments the scroll i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul
unlike you and i jesus knew he ’ d die some days a headache woke him it lingered nothing terrible but the word hung around his temples like this soul everyone wants but can ’ t find jesus knew he ’ d die he just didn ’ t know how that bothered him sometimes then he ’ d do one of his little bootleg tricks what the hell didn ’ t hurt anyone didn ’ t make anyone disappear for- ever but the tricks stopped working he forgot why he did them what for he confused a story about a guy named jesus with a story about a father he never knew it all began to hang like a motheaten coat pulled out of a trunk on shaky days hey let ’ s return to the scene of the fucken tragedy at least we all know how it turns out instead of this end- less uncertainty hey let ’ s sell our souls a few more times no one ’ s really counting those little papers you trade for your sins what do you call them anyone no —anyway—jesus this jesus that god of nickel god of dime right the real jesus he was lost he walked in- to the desert not far really his friends his disciples he told them he ’ d come back like us he said this every time he left but jesus never said wait never pointed to the sky never claimed he ’ d rise again never asked us to eat his flesh jesus never asked anything as far as i can tell he got tired everyday then slept sometimes okay sometimes un- bearable the dreams the father pointing a finger at everyone a finger we can ’ t even look at

sunday 12 may 1833 the clouds are marshalling across the sky leaving their deepest tints upon yon range of soul-alluring hills the breeze comes softly laden with tribute that a hundred orchards now in their fullest blossom send in thanks for this refreshing shower the birds pour forth in heightened melody the notes of praise they had suspended while god ’ s voice was speaking and his eye flashing down upon his world i sigh half-charmed half-pained my sense is living and taking in this freshened beauty tells its pleasure to the mind the mind replies and strives to wake the heart in turn repeating poetic sentiments from many a record which other souls have left when stirred and satisfied by scenes as fair as fragrant but the heart sends back a hollow echo to the call of outward things — and its once bright companion who erst would have been answered by a stream of life-fraught treasures thankful to be summoned — can now rouse nothing better than this echo unmeaning voice which mocks their softened accents content thee beautiful world and hush still busy mind my heart hath sealed its fountains to the things of time they shall be oped no more too long too often were they poured forth part have sunk into the desert part profaned and swollen by bitter waters mixed by those who feigned they asked them for refreshment which turned back have broken and o ’ erflowed their former urns so when ye talk of pleasure lonely world and busy mind ye ne ’ er again shall move me to answer ye though still your calls have power to jar me through and cause dull aching here no so the voice which hailed me from the depths of yon dark-bosomed cloud now vanishing before the sun ye greet it touched my centre the voice of the eternal calling me to feel his other worlds to feel that if i could deserve a home i still might find it in other spheres — and bade me not despair though ‘ want of harmony ’ and ‘ aching void ’ are terms invented by the men of this which i may not forget in former times i loved to see the lightnings flash athwart the stooping heavens i loved to hear the thunder call to the seas and mountains for i thought ‘ tis thus man ’ s flashing fancy doth enkidle the firmament of mind ‘ tis thus his eloquence calls unto the soul ’ s depths and heights and still i defied the creature nor remembered the creator in his works ah now how different the proud delight of that keen sympathy is gone no longer riding on the wave but whelmed beneath it my own plans and works or as the scriptures phrase it my ’ inventions ’ no longer interpose ‘ twist me and heaven today for the first time i felt the deity and uttered prayer on hearing thunder this must be thy will — for finer higher spirits have gone through this same process — yet i think there was religion in that strong delight those sounds those thoughts of power imparted true i did not say ‘ he is the lord thy god ’ but i had feeling of his essence but ‘ ’ twas pride by which the angels fell. ’ so be it but o might i but see a little onward father i can not be a spirit of power may i be active as a spirit of love since thou hast ta ’ en me from that path which nature seemed to appoint o deign to ope another where i may walk with thought and hope assured ‘ lord i believe help thou mine unbelief ’ had i but faith like that which fired novalis i too could bear that the heart ‘ fall in ashes ’ while the freed spirit rises from beneath them with heavenward-look and phoenix-plumes upsoaring
—now let me tell you why i said that try to put yourself into an experimental mood stop right here and try to review everything you felt about that line did you accept it as wisdom as perception as a gem maybe for your private anthology of telling truths my point is that the line is fraudulent a blurb it is also relevant that i know at least a dozen devoutly intellectual journals that will gladly buy any fourteen such lines plus a tinny rhyme scheme and compound the felony by calling that a sonnet —very well then i am a cynic though for the record let me add that i am a cynic with one wife three children and other invest- ments whoever heard of a cynic carrying a pack for the fun of it it won ’ t really do i ’ m something else were i to dramatize myself i ’ d say i am a theologian who keeps meeting the devil as a master of make-up and that among his favorite impersonations he appears often as not as the avuncular old ham who winks tugs his ear and utters such gnomic garbage as “ nothing is really hard but to be real. ” i guess what the devil gets out of this—if he is the fool he seems to be—is the illusion of imitating heaven if on the other hand he is no fool then his deceptions are carefully practiced and we are all damned for all of us unless we are carefully warned will accept such noises as examples of the sound an actual mind makes why arc we damned then —i am glad you asked that it is as we say to flatter oafs a good question meaning usually the one we were fishing for good in any case i may now pretend to think out the answer i have memorized we are damned for accepting as the sound a man makes the sound of something else thereby losing the truth of our own sound how do we learn our own sound another good question thank you —by listening to what men there have been and are —by reading more poets than jurists without scorning law —and by reading what we read not for its oration but for its resemblance to that sound in which we best hear most of what a man is get that sound into your heads and you will know what tones to exclude —if there is enough exclusion in you to keep the pie plates out of the cymbals the tin horns out of the brass section the baling wire out of the strings and thereby to let the notes roll full to the ear that has listened enough to be a listener as for the devil—when he has finished every imp- ersonation the best he will have been able to accomplish is only that sound which is exactly not the music

there are who separate the eternal light in forms of man and woman day and night they can not bear that god be essence quite existence is as deep a verity without the dual where is unity and the ‘ i am ’ can not forbear to be but from its primal nature forced to frame mysteries destinies of various name is forced to give what it has taught to claim thus love must answer to its own unrest the bad commands us to expect the best and hope of its own prospects is the test and dost thou seek to find the one in two only upon the old can build the new the symbol which you seek is found in you the heart and mind the wisdom and the will the man and woman must be severed still and christ must reconcile the good and ill. there are to whom each symbol is a mask the life of love is a mysterious task they want no answer for they would not ask a single thought transfuses every form the sunny day is changed into the storm for light is dark hard soft and cold is warm one presence fills and floods the whole serene nothing can be nothing has ever been except the one truth that creates the scene does the heart beat — that is a seeming only you can not be alone though you are lonely the all is neutralized in the one only you ask a faith — they are content with faith you ask to have — but they reply ‘ it hath. ’ there is no end and there need be no path the day wears heavily — why then ignore it peace is the soul ’ s desire — such thoughts restore it the truth thou art — it needs not to implore it the presence all thy fancies supersedes all that is done which thou wouldst seek in deeds the wealth obliterates all seeming needs both these are true and if they are at strife the mystery bears the one name of life that slowly spelled will yet compose the strife the men of old say ‘ live twelve thousand years and see the need of all that here appears and moxen* shall absorb thy smiles and tears. ’ these later men say ‘ live this little day believe that human nature is the way and know both son and father while you pray and one in two in three and none alone letting you know even as you are known shall make the you and me eternal parts of one. ’ to me our destinies seem flower and fruit born of an ever-generating root the other statement i can not dispute but say that love and life eternal seem and if eternal ties be but a dream what is the meaning of that self-same seem your nature craves eternity for truth eternity of love is prayer of youth how without love would have gone forth your truth i do not think we are deceived to grow but that the crudest fancy slightest show covers some separate truth that we may know in the one truth each separate fact is true eternally in one i many view and destinies through destiny pursue this is my tendency but can i say that this my thought leads the true only way i only know it constant leads and i obey i only know one prayer — ‘ give me the truth give me that colored whiteness ancient youth complex and simple seen in joy and truth let me not by vain wishes bar my claim nor soothe my hunger by an empty name nor crucify the son of man by hasty blame but in the earth and fire water and air live earnestly by turns without despair nor seek a home till home be every where ’
i do not know if climbing some steep hill through fragrant wooded pass this glimpse i bought or whether in some mid-day i was caught to upper air where visions of god ’ s will in pictures to our quickened sense fulfil his word but this i saw a path i sought through wall of rock no human fingers wrought the golden gates which opened sudden still and wide my fear was hushed by my delight surpassing fair the lands my path lay plain alas so spell-bound feasting on the sight i paused that i but reached the threshold bright when swinging swift the golden gates again were rocky wall by which i wept in vain
on the death of my sister cecilia—the last of five members of the family who died successively our family tree is in the sear and yellow leaf of life branch after branch year after year yields to death ’ s pruning knife first youngest born as if ’ twere meet the sacrifice should be “ the last of earth ” the first to meet th ’ unknown eternity ’ twas god who gave ’ twas he who took his voice let us obey so that in his eternal book our names shine bright as day
soft falls the shower the thunders cease and see the messenger of peace illumes the eastern skies blest sign of firm unchanging love while others seek the cause to prove that bids thy beauties rise my soul content with humbler views well pleased admires thy varied hues and can with joy behold thy beauteous form and wondering gaze enraptured on thy mingled rays of purple green and gold enough for me to deem divine the hand that paints each glowing line to think that thou art given a transient gleam of that bright place where beauty owns celestial grace a faint display of heaven
if heaven has into being deigned to call thy light o liberty to shine on all bright intellectual sun why does thy ray to earth distribute only partial day since no resisting cause from spirit flows

look at their faces you know it all they married the week he left for the war both are gentle intelligent people as all four of their parents were they ’ ve never talked about much except the children they love each other but never wondered why they married or had the kids or stayed together it wasn ’ t because they knew the answers they had never heard the questions that twisted through the jokes to come of moses and the ten suggestions they paid their debts and never doubted god rewarded faith and virtue or when you got out of line had big and little ways to hurt you people walked alone in parks children slept in their yards at night most every man had a paying job and black was black and white was white would you go back say that you can that all it takes is a wave and a wink and there you are so what do you do the question is crueler than you think

to pass through astonishment and know much too late and because habit makes us strange i find myself searching on a landscape that generates questions beyond its ability to solve that dark post out there might be this poem standing as you would — lead in the 4th grade play — under theater lights and your shadows that petal around you and what should be most memorable isn ’ t so i recall those prolonged moments of silence incongruous and revealing as metaphor most frequently for instance waiting at the bus stop in pai in a midmorning the hue of the roadside guardrails that dot the cliff ’ s side like morse code before leaving with trees those felled ones half-painted white the burnt trunks ... that passed by like the so many phenomena of our days blurred together into a motion at times convincing as a nickelodeon ’ s i waited under the thatched roof of the station with other travelers with each in our common solitude risen around like that haydn piece in the tunnel i descended into on my way out onto broadway from the 1 train some months ago it seemed of hopper star fruit on the ground discolored withering blighted three of the town ’ s strays hobbled by before midday ’ s heat stalled the town like some lost stephano trinculo and their lamed dark sycophant — at least that ’ s what they were for me it wasn ’ t comfort never comfort but something else and when each moment with expectations for more than it can hold leads to the next and soon — as then — expectation fills up the day as does your breath a balloon the day floats with such care and strange hours and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul ... plato wrote — poetry ’ s banisher beauty ’ s guard 2 my hands grow differently used while one hand thumbs pages the other hand steadies open the book it ’

in jerusalem and i mean within the ancient walls i walk from one epoch to another without a memory to guide me the prophets over there are sharing the history of the holy ... ascending to heaven and returning less discouraged and melancholy because love and peace are holy and are coming to town i was walking down a slope and thinking to myself how do the narrators disagree over what light said about a stone is it from a dimly lit stone that wars flare up i walk in my sleep i stare in my sleep i see no one behind me i see no one ahead of me all this light is for me i walk i become lighter i fly then i become another transfigured words sprout like grass from isaiah ’ s messenger mouth “ if you don ’ t believe you won ’ t be safe. ” i walk as if i were another and my wound a white biblical rose and my hands like two doves on the cross hovering and carrying the earth i don ’ t walk i fly i become another transfigured no place and no time so who am i i am no i in ascension ’ s presence but i think to myself alone the prophet muhammad spoke classical arabic “ and then what ” then what a woman soldier shouted is that you again didn ’ t i kill you i said you killed me ... and i forgot like you to die
to our land and it is the one near the word of god a ceiling of clouds to our land and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns the map of absence to our land and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasm to our land and it is the one poor as a grouse ’ s wings holy books ... and an identity wound to our land and it is the one surrounded with torn hills the ambush of a new past to our land and it is a prize of war the freedom to die from longing and burning and our land in its bloodied night is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the far and illuminates what ’ s outside it ... as for us inside we suffocate more
a stranger on the riverbank like the river ... water binds me to your name nothing brings me back from my faraway to my palm tree not peace and not war nothing makes me enter the gospels not a thing ... nothing sparkles from the shore of ebb and flow between the euphrates and the nile nothing makes me descend from the pharaoh ’ s boats nothing carries me or makes me carry an idea not longing and not promise what will i do what will i do without exile and a long night that stares at the water water binds me to your name ... nothing takes me from the butterflies of my dreams to my reality not dust and not fire what will i do without roses from samarkand what will i do in a theater that burnishes the singers with its lunar stones our weight has become light like our houses in the faraway winds we have become two friends of the strange creatures in the clouds ... and we are now loosened from the gravity of identity ’ s land what will we do … what will we do without exile and a long night that stares at the water water binds me to your name ... there ’ s nothing left of me but you and nothing left of you but me the stranger massaging his stranger ’ s thigh o stranger what will we do with what is left to us of calm ... and of a snooze between two myths and nothing carries us not the road and not the house was this road always like this from the start or did our dreams find a mare on the hill among the mongol horses and exchange us for it and what will we do what will we do without exile

and one more desire the dead man had left to be taken to his father ’ s bosom and hide his crumbling face and weep with his arms round the neck of his progenitor that ’ s rotting and the laughing gold skull of his father refrained i too had a father and i too yearned slowly slowly the lines of the dead man ’ s face vanished the shape of his body gradually shrank nature carved the dead man to the style and single mold of all the dead from way back and the remaining frame of his lips locked with the dust and hid in the earth surrounding it and the shamed smile of the man gradually dimmed and melted in the thick of the earth and the dead man forgot his ignominy and forgot the shah of iran and the minister of trade and treasury and the matchmaker venus katz and all the ends of evening newspaper became a sticky paste and mixed with the universe ’ s general rubbish and the dead man who cried as he was lowered in the hole and wept for many days was already quiet now faithfully devoted to the process of his death a dedicated student of the nature of decomposition and the kidney innocent and untouched by any contact with the life over his head a retired righteous man silent monk purifying in the silence of his death and his brows raised a little in an expression of spiritual uplift and with the sinking of his life ’ s filth and clarification of his soul the dead man listened to his innards and there was silence complete and absolute was the silence and in the middle of the quiet the heart of stillness like a boat on a section of congealed lake water he heard a faint silent keen the keen of a little boy a kind of peep that was folded and cramped in the inmost part of his soul so many years like the first cheep crushed in the breast of the chick hidden in the egg for is it not the eternal keen that is not drawn and is not drained the keen of the boy to be hung upon the neck of his dad for what more is left in us when we peel away— the paper and the wife and a crust of bread being held up in our father ’ s arms the frightened face pressed in between hot neck smelling of fresh soap and the collar of his fresh pressed shirt there in that place a spot we ’ ve known a warm hollow between the neck and armpit a little island of tranquility this island is lost but we still search in every person for arms that will lift us up in every face—the glow of our father that floods with love ’ s dew our tears all of the people from one year old to seventy whether alive or dead all need daddy here ’ s the hooker standing on the corner at nightfall and here ’ s the old man going up to her she ’ s an orphan though she has breasts and thighs and apparently something more useful still her eyes dart around clearly she has no daddy and the old man it goes without saying he too is orphaned and two orphans meet both a little scared they fix a price they go in the yard he drops his pants and she—her dress and an orphan manhood rises—falls— where are the uplifting arms of daddy —and spread before it an orphan crotch and in another minute the great sorrow of orphanhood enfolds a dozen or fewer feeble thrusts like an orphan ’ s kaddish on a morning of tevet and as an orphan cop sneaks in the yard and catches the two orphans by the neck and leads them to the patrol car there they sit an enclosed trio three orphans in the silence of their ache without knowing what and where and how and the paddy wagon ’ s siren wails out the great sob here ride three people that lost their daddy and the dead man lay on his couch and the mold of a skeleton was already drawn through the torn ends of his flesh and his face is turned on high expectantly and waits for his daddy in your love i trust daddy i know that you will come when i call and as i trust in death and know he ’ ll come all the more i trust my daddy for who if not my daddy stands behind the gate of death and in his hand a suitcase holding all my summer clothes swimming trunks and towel and in his other hand a lunch pail and in it a buttered roll and pear and in the breach he stands my dad and waits for me and smiles what didn ’ t you know that after death there is a summer camp and god is the lifeguard and in another town in another graveyard old lay the daddy of the dead man all skeleton a veteran resident of the world of carrion and shame and from his exposed skull beams a horrified grin for he too the daddy is an orphan he too has no daddy and he too wants why not to hide his face in his father ’ s neck and find there the consolations of his life and death and his father too has a daddy a daddy and all the fathers are sons and when you peel back their skins and see they ’ re little children and all dream of being raised up to the soap-washed fresh neck flesh of daddy o miserable dead what will you do if you exit your graves climb one over another orphan over his sire and form a motley chain of skeletons a ladder of bones of sons and fathers whose head will disappear into the clouds and how will you console one another for when the father hangs his two hands on his father ’ s throat how will he handle his son who will console whom who lie in the bosom of whom many consolation-hungry stiffs will quarrel over a bosom and where is the bosom where is the neck did anybody ever catch a whiff here even once of the smell of fresh soap o miserable dead this isn ’ t california this is the dark grave and this is death so shall a son leave his father and mother and man leave his wife and cleave unto his death and the dead man saw how his father betrayed him and his father ’ s skull grinned its horrified grin and with it grinned his father ’ s father ’ s skull and grinned his fathers ’ fathers to the last generation and as the audience ’ s smile gleams in the dark of an auditorium at seeing the threadbare comedy not a smile of pleasure but a smile of delight at the misery of actors embarrassing themselves so from the darkness of their cellar graves shone the horrified grins and skulls upon skulls upon skulls rolled in silent mirth at the sight of the eternal son his foolish hope to be taken to his father ’ s bosom and his bitter cry in the hole this is the eternal cry that rolls endlessly gladdens the heart each in his turn of the audience of hole residents with death the bonds of family are loosed and son to his father ’ s a dog and on passover night each one by one will lick his own bones alone our father who us did love his mouth is gaped to heaven ruff ruff
a gold box of latin words rests in a dazzling fanciful field someone raised to life lavishing flowers with untraceable roots histories too distant to discern upon skin-pale palm-sized vellum imagine the one who did this lost in dwindling light a trembling flame and painstakingly lovely colors blood red violet heavy yellow and fierce unnatural green framed like a window to the artist 's heart the mother and child uncomprehending men offering what they can the infant touches a tiny gold-leaf casket all around him the dark heraldic blue of angel winds night sky her veil and below him you can see the word god printed over infinitely careful erasures
my last sabbath i follow the girls who sneak into the wedding tent scattered with sun flower seeds and remnants of celebration they each stand up on a table take a crushed beer can as a microphone sing and move their fifteen-year-old hips i watch clap for them until a small face peers in the door a boy his face white with something the door slamming his very small fist holding it shut having found what was inside wrong enough i tell him enough he leaves the girls dance again but less bold look the boy has come back is looking you hard in the eye through the crack of the door there in his hand a neon plastic bb gun he does this for his grandmother and for his son
the people who live here do two things their faces whiten past you or blacken into you girls are not supposed to come to islands by themselves did no one tell you you found the highest hill away from their whistles their eyes up here only windy grass the blow of sea that brought you only a few cigarette butts pistachio shells they come here but hardly the house you make is sticks and burrs dirt on white knuckles the sea through the cracks they do not talk to you anymore or look at you your first wish the wind and sea are full of stomachs now learn to disappear into them your house ’ s slender frame catches fire one day you hear them buzzing below they watch they stand wild brightness from the hill reflecting in each eye light birds almost green among the sparks is it the sun no the moon has caught the sun in its mouth the moon is nothing but the sun letting it see itself the question comes again do you have too much faith in people or too little like when you were sitting on the ledge by the sea and three large boys ’ shadows stubbed the grass your first thought was so they will make me fall but they don ’ t make you fall whether they are afraid of you or you of them whether they are jeering is not clear this is the island with the hill with the house with the girl with the fire inside afterwards they climb to the top to look at something ruined close-up they touch the door soft with ash the body amongst the branches and birds is white the face catches the sun ’ s light

for hours now the last supper has been over and the beating almost over and morning ’ s cry yet to be heard by the workmen in the courtyard warming themselves by the hasty fire and peter near the agony in the garden feeling something terrible happening blinking back stale sleep peter turns his face from strangers ’ stares “ this man also was with jesus. ” the others slowly turning toward him with cold interest and his own voice thick-tongued “ i do not know him. ” that the cock crows not then but at the third no must tell us much about the nature of faith how it leans on separations how it robes simple gestures—a hand waving from an open window— with deferral as if real knowledge only comes after as though peter could only see what he ’ d done upon going from the high priest ’ s courtyard and all alone weeping bitterly in the dawn that much we can understand but why then does chekhov revisit this known hard ground with a half-frozen student who on his way back from a failed hunt thinks how this same chill easter wind must have blown in rurik ’ s age and scourged the hungry poor in the years of peter the great and ivan the terrible wind raw wind hunger icy needles of rain the same as then—until coming on two widows a huge shapeless old woman in a man ’ s overcoat and her putty-faced daughter washing a kettle the student asks if he might share their fire saying as he does that st. peter had on such a night warmed himself before a fire on such a cold extraordinarily long and terrible night murmuring welcomes they bring him inside and soon he finds himself describing in detail that part of the gospel which is peter ’ s betrayal “ thus i imagine it the garden deathly still and very dark and in the silence came sounds of muffled sobbing— ” here his account breaks off when the absently-smiling vasilissa suddenly weeps burying her eyes in her apron whereupon her daughter herself bowed down by sickness and filth blushes and turns away the student for all his theology is speechless there ’ s nothing for it now but to step out with empty game-bag and find his moonlit way back home across the ancient marsh only then does he see in the waterlogged meadow well beyond the river ’ s sedges something remarkable a high-walled garden looming green against a background of sand nineteen hundred years crossed in heartbeats in that kindled instant all the world ’ s travails drop from his shoulders just twenty-two he has found the very quick of faith gone are hunger sleet and useless words gone ah we leave him there at century ’ s end before he has returned to his village —and all that returning would surely mean— in this the briefest of the master ’ s stories

from sonnets third series v how well do i recall that walk in state across the common by the paths we knew myself in silver badge and riband blue my little sister with her book and slate the elm tree by the pond the fence of wood the burial place that at the corner stood where once we crossed through the forbidden grate the stones that grudg ’ d us way the graveside weed the ominous wind that turned us half about smit the flying drops at what a speed across the paths unblessed and unforgiven we hurried homeward when the day was late and heard with awe that left no place for doubt god ’ s anger mutter in the darkened heaven
childhood which childhood the one that didn ’ t last the one in which you learned to be afraid of the boarded-up well in the backyard and the ladder in the attic the one presided over by armed men in ill-fitting uniforms strolling the streets and alleys while loudspeakers declared a new era and the house around you grew bigger the rooms farther apart with more and more people missing the photographs whispered to each other from their frames in the hallway the cooking pots said your name each time you walked past the kitchen and you pretended to be dead with your sister in games of rescue and abandonment you learned to lie still so long the world seemed a play you viewed from the muffled safety of a wing look in run the servants screaming the soldiers shouting turning over the furniture smashing your mother ’ s china don ’ t fall asleep each act opens with your mother reading a letter that makes her weep each act closes with your father fallen into the hands of pharaoh which childhood the one that never ends o you still a child and slow to grow still talking to god and thinking the snow falling is the sound of god listening and winter is the high-ceilinged house where god measures with one eye an ocean wave in octaves and minutes and counts on many fingers all the ways a child learns to say me which childhood the one from which you ’ ll never escape you so slow to know what you know and don ’ t know still thinking you hear low song in the wind in the eaves story in your breathing grief in the heard dove at evening and plentitude in the unseen bird tolling at morning still slow to tell memory from imagination heaven from here and now hell from here and now death from childhood and both of them from dreaming

oil on limbs maybe a rancid smell as on the chapel ’ s oil-press here as on the rough pores of the unturning stone oil on hair wreathed in rope and maybe other scents unknown to us poor and rich and statuettes offering small breasts with their fingers oil in the sun the leaves shuddered when the stranger stopped and the silence weighed between the knees the coins fell ‘ in the goddess ’ s name i summon you ... ’ oil on the shoulders and the flexing waist legs grass-dappled and that wound in the sun as the bell rang for vespers as i spoke in the churchyard with a crippled man
outside the hotel window unenlightened pigeons weave and dive like stukas on their prey apparently some tiny insect brother in india the attainment of nonviolence is considered a proper goal for human beings if one of the pigeons should fly into the illusion of my window and survive the body is no illusion when it ’ s hurt he could be taken across town to the bird hospital where jains skilled medical men repair the feathery sick and broken victims there in reproof of violence and of nothing else live mahavira ’ s brothers and sisters to this small gentle order of monks and nuns it is bright vishnu and dark shiva who are illusion they trust in faith cognition and nonviolence to release them from rebirth they think that birds and animals—like us some predators some prey— should be ministered to no less than men and women the jains who deal with creatures and with laymen wear white while their more enterprising hermit brothers walk naked and are called the sky-clad jains pray to no deity human kindness being their sole illusion mahavira and those twenty-three other airy creatures who turned to saints with him preached the doctrine of ahimsa which in our belligerent tongue becomes nonviolence it ’ s not a doctrine congenial to snarers and poultrymen who every day bring to market maimed pheasants numbers of these are brought in by the jain brothers and brought to grow back wing-tips and illusions to one of the hospitals succoring such small quarry when strong and feathered again the lucky victims get reborn on sunday mornings to the world ’ s violence released from the roofs of these temples to illusion it is hard for a westerner to speak about men and women like these who call the birds of the air brothers we recall the embarrassed fanfare for francis and his flock we ’ re poor forked sky-clad things ourselves and god knows prey to illusion—e.g. i claim these brothers and sisters in india stemming a little violence among birds
after fighting with his dead brothers and his dead sisters he chose to paint the dead rooster of his youth thinking god wouldn ’ t mind a rooster would he —or thinking a rooster would look good in a green armchair with flecks of blood on his breast and thighs his wings resting a little their delicate bones exposed a few of the plumes in blue against the yellow naked body all of those feathers plucked as if by a learned butcher and yet the head hanging down the comb disgraced the mouth open as if for screaming the right front chair leg seen from a certain angle either a weapon or a strong right arm a screaming arm the arm of an agitator and yet at the same time the chair as debonair as any the brown mahogany polished the carving nineteenth century the velvet green an old velour as if to match the plumes a little a blue with a green no rabbi was present this he knew and no dead butcher had ever been there with his burnished knife and his bucket of sand this was the angry rooster that strutted from one small house to another that scratched among the rhubarb he is the one who stopped as if he were thinking he is upside down now and plucked it looks as if his eye can hardly contain that much of sorrow as if it wanted to disappear and it looks as if his legs were almost helpless and though his body was huge compared to the armchair it was only more horrible that way and though his wings were lifted it wasn ’ t for soaring it was more for bedragglement and degradation whatever else there was of memory there had to be revenge in there even revenge on himself for he had to be the rooster though that was easy he was the armchair too and he was the butcher it was a way to understand there couldn ’ t be another he had to paint like that he has to scrape the skin and put the blotches on and though it was grotesque to put a dead rooster in an armchair his table could have been full or he just liked the arrangement or he was good at painting a chair and it was done first—although i doubt it—or someone brought him the bird—a kind of gift—for food was cheap then and roosters were easy to cook but it was more than anything else a kind of tartar a kind of jew he was painting something that moved from asia to europe something furious ill and dreamy something that stood in the mud beside a large wooden building and stared at a cloud it was so deep in thought and it had tears in a way there was no getting around that kind of thinking even if he stood in the middle of the room holding his paintbrush like a thumb at arm ’ s length closing one of his eyes he still was standing in the mud shrieking he still was dying for corn he still was golden underneath his feathers with freckles of blood for he was a ripped-open jew and organs all on show the gizzard the liver for he was a bleeding tartar and he was a frenchman dying on the way to paris and he was tethered to a table he was slaughtered

someone is in the kitchen washing the dishes someone is in the living room watching the news someone in a bedroom is holding a used stamp with tweezers and adding it to his collection someone is scolding a dog barking now for decades a different dog for each of the decades someone is reading the paper and listening to a baseball game on the radio at the same time — at the base of the altar you drop some coins into a wooden box and the lights reveal the vast worn painting in front of you the holy subject is illuminated for a few minutes before it is dim again there are churches all over italy where you can do this the smell of incense stone — someone is taking the ashes out of the small cave of the fireplace though this might have been a hundred years ago when the house was new and we didn ’ t live in it someone is writing a letter on thin blue paper someone is putting down the needle onto a spinning record just so on the couch someone is sleeping upstairs someone is looking into the bathroom mirror — while we were waiting for her surgery to finish i walked around the hospital and came across a waiting room that had an enormous aquarium the black fish with red stripes the yellow fish with blue stripes the triangle fish the cylinder fish the little orange schools and the cellophane glints of their quick turns in the box of water among arrangements of coral the city of bones — someone is walking down the creaking staircase in the dark a hand sliding on the rail someone is on the telephone which means nobody else can use it for another hour someone in his room is doing homework me or someone almost like me twenty fifty years ago someone is reading in her room someone is talking to the gray wall someone is talking to the gray wall in summer on a hot afternoon someone peels at a corner of wallpaper and sees more wallpaper beneath — i used to think that to write poems to make art meant trying to transcend the prosaic elements of the self to arrive at some essential plane where poems were supposed to succeed i was wrong

of mans first disobedience and the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal tast brought death into the world and all our woe with loss of eden till one greater man restore us and regain the blissful seat sing heav'nly muse that on the secret top of oreb or of sinai didst inspire that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed in the beginning how the heav'ns and earth rose out of chaos or if sion hill delight thee more and siloa 's brook that flow'd fast by the oracle of god i thence invoke thy aid to my adventrous song that with no middle flight intends to soar above th aonian mount while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhime and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer before all temples th upright heart and pure instruct me for thou know'st thou from the first wast present and with mighty wings outspread dove-like satst brooding on the vast abyss and mad'st it pregnant what in me is dark illumin what is low raise and support that to the highth of this great argument i may assert eternal providence and justifie the wayes of god to men say first for heav'n hides nothing from thy view nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause mov 'd our grand parents in that happy state favour 'd of heav'n so highly to fall off from thir creator and transgress his will for one restraint lords of the world besides who first seduc 'd them to that foul revolt th infernal serpent he it was whose guile stird up with envy and revenge deceiv'd the mother of mankind what time his pride had cast him out from heav'n with all his host of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring to set himself in glory above his peers he trusted to have equal 'd the most high if he oppos 'd and with ambitious aim against the throne and monarchy of god rais 'd impious war in heav'n and battel proud with vain attempt him the almighty power hurld headlong flaming from th ethereal skie with hideous ruine and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defie th omnipotent to arms nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men he with his horrid crew lay vanquisht rowling in the fiery gulfe confounded though immortal but his doom reserv 'd him to more wrath for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witness 'd huge affliction and dismay mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate at once as far as angels kenn he views the dismal situation waste and wilde a dungeon horrible on all sides round as one great furnace flam 'd yet from those flames no light but rather darkness visible serv 'd onely to discover sights of woe regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end still urges and a fiery deluge fed with ever-burning sulphur unconsum 'd such place eternal justice had prepar'd for those rebellious here thir prison ordained in utter darkness and thir portion set as far remov 'd from god and light of heav'n as from the center thrice to th utmost pole o how unlike the place from whence they fell there the companions of his fall o'rewhelm'd with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire he soon discerns and weltring by his side one next himself in power and next in crime long after known in palestine and nam'd beelzebub to whom th arch-enemy and thence in heav'n call 'd satan with bold words breaking the horrid silence thus began if thou beest he but o how fall'n how chang'd from him who in the happy realms of light cloth 'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine myriads though bright if he whom mutual league united thoughts and counsels equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprize joynd with me once now misery hath joynd in equal ruin into what pit thou seest from what highth fall'n so much the stronger prov'd he with his thunder and till then who knew the force of those dire arms yet not for those nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict do i repent or change though chang 'd in outward lustre that fixt mind and high disdain from sence of injur 'd merit that with the mightiest rais 'd me to contend and to the fierce contention brought along innumerable force of spirits arm'd that durst dislike his reign and me preferring his utmost power with adverse power oppos'd in dubious battel on the plains of heav'n and shook his throne what though the field be lost all is not lost the unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and what is else not to be overcome that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deifie his power who from the terrour of this arm so late doubted his empire that were low indeed that were an ignominy and shame beneath this downfall since by fate the strength of gods and this empyreal substance can not fail since through experience of this great event in arms not worse in foresight much advanc't we may with more successful hope resolve to wage by force or guile eternal warr irreconcileable to our grand foe who now triumphs and in th excess of joy sole reigning holds the tyranny of heav'n so spake th apostate angel though in pain vaunting aloud but rackt with deep despare and him thus answer 'd soon his bold compeer o prince o chief of many throned powers that led th imbattelld seraphim to warr under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds fearless endanger 'd heav'ns perpetual king and put to proof his sigh supremacy whether upheld by strength or chance or fate too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defeat hath lost us heav'n and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as gods and heav'nly essences can perish for the mind and spirit remains invincible and vigour soon returns though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallow 'd up in endless misery but what if he our conquerour whom i now of force believe almighty since no less then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours have left us this our spirit and strength intire strongly to suffer and support our pains that we may so suffice his vengeful ire or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of warr what e 're his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire or do his errands in the gloomy deep what can it then avail though yet we feel strength undiminisht or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment whereto with speedy words th arch-fiend reply 'd fall'n cherube to be weak is

providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good our labour must be to pervert that end and out of good still to find means of evil which oft times may succeed so as perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb his inmost counsels from thir destind aim but see the angry victor hath recall'd his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heav'n the sulphurous hail shot after

field pavilion 'd with his guardians bright nor that which on the flaming mount appeerd in dothan cover 'd with a camp of fire against the syrian king who to surprize one man assassin-like had levied warr warr unproclam 'd the princely hierarch in thir bright stand there left his powers to seise possession of the garden hee alone to find where adam shelterd took his way not unperceav 'd of adam who to eve while the great visitant approachd thus spake eve now expect great tidings which perhaps of us will soon determin or impose new laws to be observ 'd for i descrie from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill one of the heav'nly host and by his gate none of the meanest some great potentate or of the thrones above such majestie invests him coming yet not terrible that i should fear nor sociably mild as raphael that i should much confide but solemn and sublime whom not to offend with reverence i must meet and thou retire he ended and th arch-angel soon drew nigh not in his shape celestial but as man clad to meet man over his lucid armes a militarie vest of purple flowd livelier then meliboean or the graine of sarra worn by kings and hero 's old in time of truce lris had dipt the wooff his starrie helme unbuckl 'd shew 'd him prime in manhood where youth ended by his side as in a glistering zodiac hung the sword satans dire dread and in his hand the spear adam bowd low hee kingly from his state inclin 'd not but his coming thus declar 'd adam heav'ns high behest no preface needs sufficient that thy prayers are heard and death then due by sentence when thou didst transgress defeated of his seisure many dayes giv'n thee of grace wherein thou may'st repent and one bad act with many deeds well done mayst cover well may then thy lord appeas'd redeem thee quite from deaths rapacious claime but longer in this paradise to dwell permits not to remove thee i am come and send thee from the garden forth to till the ground whence thou wast tak'n fitter soile he added not for adam at the newes heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood that all his senses bound eve who unseen yet all had heard with audible lament discover 'd soon the place of her retire o unexpected stroke worse then of death must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave thee native soile these happie walks and shades fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend quiet though sad the respit of that day that must be mortal to us both o flours that never will in other climate grow my early visitation and my last at eev'n which i bred up with tender hand from the first op'ning bud and gave ye names who now shall reare ye to the sun or ranke your tribes and water from th ambrosial fount thee lastly nuptial bowre by mee adornd with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee how shall i part and whither wander down into a lower world to this obscure and wilde how shall we breath in other aire less pure accustomd to immortal fruits whom thus the angel interrupted milde lament not eve but patiently resigne what justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart thus over-fond on that which is not thine thy going is not lonely with thee goes thy husband him to follow thou art bound where he abides think there thy native soile adam by this from the cold sudden damp recovering and his scatterd spirits returnd to michael thus his humble words addressd celestial whether among the thrones or nam'd of them the highest for such of shape may seem prince above princes gently hast thou tould thy message which might else in telling wound and in performing end us what besides of sorrow and dejection and despair our frailtie can sustain thy tidings bring departure from this happy place our sweet recess and onely consolation left familiar to our eyes all places else inhospitable appeer and desolate nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer incessant i could hope to change the will of him who all things can i would not cease to wearie him with my assiduous cries but prayer against his absolute decree no more availes then breath against the winde blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth therefore to his great bidding i submit this most afflicts me that departing hence as from his face i shall be hid deprivd his blessed count'nance here i could frequent with worship place by place where he voutsaf'd presence divine and to my sons relate on this mount he appeerd under this tree stood visible among these pines his voice i heard here with him at this fountain talk 'd so many grateful altars i would reare of grassie terfe and pile up every stone of lustre from the brook in memorie or monument to ages and thereon offer sweet smelling gumms and fruits and flours in yonder nether world where shall i seek his bright appearances or foot-step trace for though i fled him angrie yet recall'd to life prolongd and promisd race i now gladly behold though but his utmost skirts of glory and farr off his steps adore to whom thus michael with regard benigne adam thou know'st heav'n his and all the earth not this rock onely his omnipresence fills land sea and aire and every kinde that lives fomented by his virtual power and warmd all th earth he gave thee to possess and rule no despicable gift surmise not then his presence to these narrow bounds confin'd of paradise or eden this had been perhaps thy capital seate from whence had spred all generations and had hither come from all the ends of th earth to celebrate and reverence thee thir great progenitor but this praeeminence thou hast lost brought down to dwell on eeven ground now with thy sons yet doubt not but in vallie and in plaine god is as here and will be found alike present and of his presence many a signe still following thee still compassing thee round with goodness and paternal love his face express and of his steps the track divine which that thou mayst beleeve and be confirmd ere thou from hence depart know i am sent to shew thee what shall come in future dayes to thee and to thy ofspring good with bad expect to hear supernal grace contending with sinfulness of men thereby to learn true patience and to temper joy with fear and pious sorrow equally enur'd by moderation either state to beare prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead safest thy life and best prepar 'd endure thy mortal passage when it comes ascend this hill let eve for i have drencht her eyes here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st as once thou slepst while shee to life was formd to whom thus adam gratefully repli 'd ascend i follow thee safe guide the path thou lead'st me and to the hand of heav'n submit however chast'ning to the evil turne my obvious breast arming to overcom by suffering and earne rest from labour won if so i may attain so both ascend in the visions of god it was a hill of paradise the highest from whose top the hemisphere of earth in cleerest ken stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay not higher that hill nor wider looking round whereon for different cause the tempter set our second adam in the wilderness to shew him all earths kingdomes and thir glory his eye might there command wherever stood city of old or modern fame the seat of mightiest empire from the destind walls of cambalu seat of cathaian can and samarchand by oxus temirs throne to paquin of sinaean kings and thence to agra and lahor of great mogul down to the golden chersonese or where the persian in ecbatan sate or since in hispahan or where the russian ksar in mosco or the sultan in bizance turchestan-born nor could his eye not ken th empire of negus to his utmost port ercoco and the less maritim kings mombaza and quiloa and melind and sofala thought ophir to the realme of congo and angola fardest south or thence from niger flood to atlas mount the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus marocco and algiers and tremisen on europe thence and where rome was to sway the world in spirit perhaps he also saw rich mexico the seat of motezume and cusco in peru the richer seat of atabalipa and yet unspoil'd guiana whose great citie geryons sons call el dorado but to nobler sights michael from adams eyes the filme remov'd which that false fruit that promis 'd clearer sight had bred then purg 'd with euphrasie and rue the visual nerve for he had much to see and from the well of life three drops instill 'd so deep the power of these ingredients pierc 'd eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight that adam now enforc't to close his eyes sunk down and all his spirits became intranst but him the gentle angel by the hand soon rais 'd and his attention thus recall 'd adam now ope thine eyes and first behold th effects which thy original crime hath wrought in some to spring from thee who never touch'd th excepted tree nor with the snake conspir 'd nor sinn 'd thy sin yet from that sin derive corruption to bring forth more violent deeds his eyes he op'nd and beheld a field part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves new reapt the other part sheep-walks and foulds ith midst an altar as the land-mark stood rustic of grassie sord thither anon a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought first fruits the green eare and the yellow sheaf uncull 'd as came to hand a shepherd next more meek came with the firstlings of his flock choicest and best then sacrificing laid the inwards and thir fat with incense strew 'd on the cleft wood and all due rites perform 'd his offring soon propitious fire from heav'n consum 'd with nimble glance and grateful steame the others not for his was not sincere whereat hee inlie rag 'd and as they talk 'd smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life he fell and deadly pale groand out his soul with gushing bloud effus 'd much at that sight was adam in his heart dismai 'd and thus in haste to th angel cri 'd o teacher some great mischief hath befall'n to that meek man who well had sacrific 'd is pietie thus and pure devotion paid t whom michael thus hee also mov 'd repli 'd these two are brethren adam and to come out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain for envie that his brothers offering found from heav'n acceptance but the bloodie fact will be aveng 'd and th others faith approv'd loose no reward though here thou see him die rowling in dust and gore to which our sire alas both for the deed and for the cause but have i now seen death is this the way i must return to native dust o sight of terrour foul and ugly to behold horrid to think how horrible to feel to whom thus michael death thou hast seen in his first shape on man but many shapes of death and many are the wayes that lead to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense more terrible at th entrance then within some as thou saw'st by violent stroke shall die by fire flood famin by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring diseases dire of which a monstrous crew before thee shall appear that thou mayst know what miserie th inabstinence of eve shall bring on men immediately a place before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark a lazar-house it seemd wherein were laid numbers of all diseas 'd all maladies of gastly spasm or racking torture qualmes of heart-sick agonie all feavorous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestin stone and ulcer colic pangs daemoniac phrenzie moaping melancholie and moon-struck madness pining atrophie marasmus and wide-wasting pestilence dropsies and asthma 's and joint-racking rheums dire was the tossing deep the groans despair tended the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shook but delaid to strike though oft invok't with vows as thir chief good and final hope sight so deform what heart of rock could long drie-ey 'd behold adam could not but wept though not of woman born compassion quell'd his best of man and gave him up to tears a space till firmer thoughts restraind excess and scarce recovering words his plaint renew 'd o miserable mankind to what fall degraded to what wretched state reserv 'd better end heer unborn why is life giv'n to be thus wrested from us rather why obtruded on us thus who if we knew what we receive would either not accept life offer 'd or soon beg to lay it down glad to be so dismist in peace can thus th image of god in man created once so goodly and erect though faultie since to such unsightly sufferings be debas't under inhuman pains why should not man retaining still divine similitude in part from such deformities be free and for his makers image sake exempt thir makers image answerd michael then forsook them when themselves they villifi'd to serve ungovern 'd appetite and took his image whom they serv 'd a brutish vice inductive mainly to the sin of eve therefore so abject is thir punishment disfiguring not gods likeness but thir own or if his likeness by themselves defac't while they pervert pure natures healthful rules to loathsom sickness worthily since they gods image did not reverence in themselves i yield it just said adam and submit but is there yet no other way besides these painful passages how we may come to death and mix with our connatural dust there is said michael if thou well observe the rule of not too much by temperance taught in what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence due nourishment not gluttonous delight till many years over thy head return so maist thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop into thy mothers lap or be with ease gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature this is old age but then thou must outlive thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change to witherd weak and gray thy senses then obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe to what thou hast and for the aire of youth hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne a melancholy damp of cold and dry to weigh thy spirits down and last consume the balme of life to whom our ancestor henceforth i flie not death nor would prolong life much bent rather how i may be quit fairest and easiest of this combrous charge which i must keep till my appointed day of rendring up and patiently attend my dissolution michael repli 'd nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst live well how long or short permit to heav'n and now prepare thee for another sight he lookd and saw a spacious plaine whereon were tents of various hue by some were herds of cattel grazing others whence the sound of instruments that made melodious chime was heard of harp and organ and who moovd thir stops and chords was seen his volant touch instinct through all proportions low and high fled and pursu 'd transverse the resonant fugue in other part stood one who at the forge labouring two massie clods of iron and brass had melted whether found where casual fire had wasted woods on mountain or in vale down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot to som caves mouth or whether washt by stream from underground the liquid ore he dreind into fit moulds prepar 'd from which he formd first his own tooles then what might else be wrought fusil or grav'n in mettle after these but on the hether side a different sort from the high neighbouring hills which was thir seat down to the plain descended by thir guise just men they seemd and all thir study bent to worship god aright and know his works not hid nor those things last which might preserve freedom and peace to men they on the plain long had not walkt when from the tents behold a beavie of fair women richly gay in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung soft amorous ditties and in dance came on the men though grave ey 'd them and let thir eyes rove without rein till in the amorous net fast caught they lik 'd and each his liking chose and now of love they treat till th eevning star loves harbinger appeerd then all in heat they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke hymen then first to marriage rites invok't with feast and musick all the tents resound such happy interview and fair event of love and youth not lost songs garlands flours and charming symphonies attach 'd the heart of adam soon enclin 'd to admit delight the bent of nature which he thus express 'd true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest much better seems this vision and more hope of peaceful dayes portends then those two past those were of hate and death or pain much worse here nature seems fulfilld in all her ends to whom thus michael judg not what is best by pleasure though to nature seeming meet created as thou art to nobler end holie and pure conformitie divine those tents thou sawst so pleasant were the tents of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race who slew his brother studious they appere of arts that polish life inventers rare unmindful of thir maker though his spirit taught them but they his gifts acknowledg 'd none yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget for that fair femal troop thou sawst that seemd of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay yet empty of all good wherein consists womans domestic honour and chief praise bred onely and completed to the taste of lustful appetence to sing to dance to dress and troule the tongue and roule the eye to these that sober race of men whose lives religious titl 'd them the sons of god shall yield up all thir vertue all thir fame ignobly to the traines and to the smiles of these fair atheists and now swim in joy erelong to swim at large and laugh for which the world erelong a world of tears must weepe to whom thus adam of short joy bereft o pittie and shame that they who to live well enterd so faire should turn aside to tread paths indirect or in the mid way faint but still i see the tenor of mans woe holds on the same from woman to begin from mans effeminate slackness it begins said th angel who should better hold his place by wisdome and superiour gifts receav 'd but now prepare thee for another scene he lookd and saw wide territorie spred before him towns and rural works between cities of men with lofty gates and towrs concours in arms fierce faces threatning warr giants of mightie bone and bould emprise part wield thir arms part courb the foaming steed single or in array of battel rang'd both horse and foot nor idely mustring stood one way a band select from forage drives a herd of beeves faire oxen and faire kine from a fat meddow ground or fleecy flock ewes and thir bleating lambs over the plaine thir bootie scarce with life the shepherds flye but call in aide which makes a bloody fray with cruel tournament the squadrons joine where cattle pastur 'd late now scatterd lies with carcasses and arms th ensanguind field deserted others to a citie strong lay seige encampt by batterie scale and mine assaulting others from the wall defend with dart and jav'lin stones and sulfurous fire on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds in other part the scepter 'd haralds call to council in the citie gates anon grey-headed men and grave with warriours mixt assemble and harangues are heard but soon in factious opposition till at last of middle age one rising eminent in wise deport spake much of right and wrong of justice of religion truth and peace and judgment from above him old and young exploded and had seiz 'd with violent hands had not a cloud descending snatch 'd him thence unseen amid the throng so violence proceeded and oppression and sword-law through all the plain and refuge none was found adam was all in tears and to his guide lamenting turnd full sad o what are these deaths ministers not men who thus deal death inhumanly to men and multiply ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew his brother for of whom such massacher make they but of thir brethren men of men but who was that just man whom had not heav'n rescu 'd had in his righteousness bin lost to whom thus michael these are the product of those ill mated marriages thou saw'st where good with bad were matcht who of themselves abhor to joyn and by imprudence mixt produce prodigious births of bodie or mind such were these giants men of high renown for in those dayes might onely shall be admir 'd and valour and heroic vertu call 'd to overcome in battle and subdue nations and bring home spoils with infinite man-slaughter shall be held the highest pitch of human glorie and for glorie done of triumph to be styl 'd great conquerours patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods destroyers rightlier call 'd and plagues of men thus fame shall be atchiev 'd renown on earth and what most merits fame in silence hid but hee the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst the onely righteous in a world perverse and therefore hated therefore so beset with foes for daring single to be just and utter odious truth that god would come to judge them with his saints him the most high rapt in a balmie cloud with winged steeds did as thou sawst receave to walk with god high in salvation and the climes of bliss exempt from death to shew thee what reward awaits the good the rest what punishment which now direct thine eyes and soon behold he look 'd and saw the face of things quite chang 'd the brazen throat of warr had ceast to roar all now was turn 'd to jollitie and game to luxurie and riot feast and dance marrying or prostituting as befell rape or adulterie where passing faire allurd them thence from cups to civil broiles at length a reverend sire among them came and of thir doings great dislike declar 'd and testifi 'd against thir wayes hee oft frequented thir assemblies whereso met triumphs or festivals and to them preachd conversion and repentance as to souls in prison under judgements imminent but all in vain which when he saw he ceas'd contending and remov 'd his tents farr off then from the mountain hewing timber tall began to build a vessel of huge bulk measur 'd by cubit length and breadth and highth smeard round with pitch and in the side a dore contriv 'd and of provisions laid in large for man and beast when loe a wonder strange of every beast and bird and insect small came seavens and pairs and enterd in as taught thir order last the sire and his three sons with thir four wives and god made fast the dore meanwhile the southwind rose and with black wings wide hovering all the clouds together drove from under heav'n the hills to their supplie vapour and exhalation dusk and moist sent up amain and now the thick'nd skie like a dark ceeling stood down rush 'd the rain impetuous and continu 'd till the earth no more was seen the floating vessel swum uplifted and secure with beaked prow rode tilting o 're the waves all dwellings else flood overwhelmd and them with all thir pomp deep under water rould sea cover 'd sea sea without shoar and in thir palaces where luxurie late reign 'd sea-monsters whelp'd and stabl 'd of mankind so numerous late all left in one small bottom swum imbark't how didst thou grieve then adam to behold the end of all thy ofspring end so sad depopulation thee another floud of tears and sorrow a floud thee also drown 'd and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reard by th angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last though comfortless as when a father mourns his children all in view destroyd at once and scarce to th angel utterdst thus thy plaint o visions ill foreseen better had i liv 'd ignorant of future so had borne my part of evil onely each dayes lot anough to beare those now that were dispenst the burd'n of many ages on me light at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth abortive to torment me ere thir being with thought that they must be let no man seek henceforth to be foretold what shall befall him or his childern evil he may be sure which neither his foreknowing can prevent and hee the future evil shall no less in apprehension then in substance feel grievous to bear but that care now is past man is not whom to warne those few escap't famin and anguish will at last consume wandring that watrie desert i had hope when violence was ceas't and warr on earth all would have then gon well peace would have crownd with length of happy dayes the race of man but i was farr deceav 'd for now i see peace to corrupt no less then warr to waste how comes it thus unfould celestial guide and whether here the race of man will end to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawst in triumph and luxurious wealth are they first seen in acts of prowess eminent and great exploits but of true vertu void who having spilt much blood and don much waste subduing nations and achievd thereby fame in the world high titles and rich prey shall change thir course to pleasure ease and sloth surfet and lust till wantonness and pride raise out of friendship hostil deeds in peace the conquerd also and enslav 'd by warr shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose and fear of god from whom thir pietie feign'd in sharp contest of battel found no aide against invaders therefore coold in zeale thenceforth shall practice how to live secure worldlie or dissolute on what thir lords shall leave them to enjoy for th earth shall bear more then anough that temperance may be tri 'd so all shall turn degenerate all deprav 'd justice and temperance truth and faith forgot one man except the onely son of light in a dark age against example good against allurement custom and a world offended fearless of reproach and scorn or violence hee of thir wicked wayes shall them admonish and before them set the paths of righteousness how much more safe and full of peace denouncing wrauth to come on thir impenitence and shall returne of them derided but of god observd the one just man alive by his command shall build a wondrous ark as thou beheldst to save himself and household from amidst a world devote to universal rack no sooner hee with them of man and beast select for life shall in the ark be lodg 'd and shelterd round but all the cataracts of heav'n set open on the earth shall powre raine day and night all fountains of the deep broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp beyond all bounds till inundation rise above the highest hills then shall this mount of paradise by might of waves be moovd out of his place pushd by the horned floud with all his verdure spoil 'd and trees adrift down the great river to the op'ning gulf and there take root an iland salt and bare the haunt of seales and orcs and sea-mews clang to teach thee that god attributes to place no sanctitie if none be thither brought by men who there frequent or therein dwell and now what further shall ensue behold he lookd and saw the ark hull on the floud which now abated for the clouds were fled drivn by a keen north-winde that blowing drie wrinkl 'd the face of deluge as decai 'd and the cleer sun on his wide watrie glass gaz 'd hot and of the fresh wave largely drew as after thirst which made thir flowing shrink from standing lake to tripping ebbe that stole with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt his sluces as the heav'n his windows shut the ark no more now flotes but seems on ground fast on the top of som high mountain fixt and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer with clamor thence the rapid currents drive towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde forthwith from out the arke a raven flies and after him the surer messenger a dove sent forth once and agen to spie green tree or ground whereon his foot may light the second time returning in his bill an olive leafe he brings pacific signe anon drie ground appeers and from his arke the ancient sire descends with all his train then with uplifted hands and eyes devout grateful to heav'n over his head beholds a dewie cloud and in the cloud a bow conspicuous with three listed colours gay betok'ning peace from god and cov'nant new whereat the heart of adam erst so sad greatly rejoyc 'd and thus his joy broke forth o thou who future things canst represent as present heav'nly instructer i revive at this last sight assur 'd that man shall live with all the creatures and thir seed preserve farr less i now lament for one whole world of wicked sons destroyd then i rejoyce for one man found so perfet and so just that god voutsafes to raise another world from him and all his anger to forget but say what mean those colourd streaks in heavn distended as the brow of god appeas 'd or serve they as a flourie verge to binde the fluid skirts of that same watrie cloud least it again dissolve and showr the earth to whom th archangel dextrously thou aim'st so willingly doth god remit his ire though late repenting him of man deprav 'd griev 'd at his heart when looking down he saw the whole earth fill 'd with violence and all flesh corrupting each thir way yet those remoov 'd such grace shall one just man find in his sight that he relents not to blot out mankind and makes a covenant never to destroy the earth again by flood nor let the sea surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world with man therein or beast but when he brings over the earth a cloud will therein set his triple-colour 'd bow whereon to look and call to mind his cov'nant day and night seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost shall hold thir course till fire purge all things new both heav'n and earth wherein the just shall dwell
as one who in his journey bates at noone though bent on speed so heer the archangel paus'd betwixt the world destroy 'd and world restor 'd if adam aught perhaps might interpose then with transition sweet new speech resumes thus thou hast seen one world begin and end and man as from a second stock proceed much thou hast yet to see but i perceave thy mortal sight to faile objects divine must needs impaire and wearie human sense henceforth what is to com i will relate thou therefore give due audience and attend this second sours of men while yet but few and while the dread of judgement past remains fresh in thir mindes fearing the deitie with some regard to what is just and right shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace labouring the soile and reaping plenteous crop corn wine and oyle and from the herd or flock oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid with large wine-offerings pour 'd and sacred feast shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam 'd and dwell long time in peace by families and tribes under paternal rule till one shall rise of proud ambitious heart who not content with fair equalitie fraternal state will arrogate dominion undeserv'd over his brethren and quite dispossess concord and law of nature from the earth hunting and men not beasts shall be his game with warr and hostile snare such as refuse subjection to his empire tyrannous a mightie hunter thence he shall be styl'd before the lord as in despite of heav'n or from heav'n claming second sovrantie and from rebellion shall derive his name though of rebellion others he accuse hee with a crew whom like ambition joyns with him or under him to tyrannize marching from eden towards the west shall finde the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge boiles out from under ground the mouth of hell of brick and of that stuff they cast to build a citie and towre whose top may reach to heav'n and get themselves a name least far disperst in foraign lands thir memorie be lost regardless whether good or evil fame but god who oft descends to visit men unseen and through thir habitations walks to mark thir doings them beholding soon comes down to see thir citie ere the tower obstruct heav'n towrs and in derision sets upon thir tongues a various spirit to rase quite out thir native language and instead to sow a jangling noise of words unknown forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud among the builders each to other calls not understood till hoarse and all in rage as mockt they storm great laughter was in heav'n and looking down to see the hubbub strange and hear the din thus was the building left ridiculous and the work confusion nam 'd whereto thus adam fatherly displeas 'd o execrable son so to aspire above his brethren to himself assuming authoritie usurpt from god not giv'n he gave us onely over beast fish fowl dominion absolute that right we hold by his donation but man over men he made not lord such title to himself reserving human left from human free but this usurper his encroachment proud stayes not on man to god his tower intends siege and defiance wretched man what food will he convey up thither to sustain himself and his rash armie where thin aire above the clouds will pine his entrails gross and famish him of breath if not of bread to whom thus michael justly thou abhorr'st that son who on the quiet state of men such trouble brought affecting to subdue rational libertie yet know withall since thy original lapse true libertie is lost which alwayes with right reason dwells twinn 'd and from her hath no dividual being reason in man obscur 'd or not obeyd immediately inordinate desires and upstart passions catch the government from reason and to servitude reduce man till then free therefore since hee permits within himself unworthie powers to reign over free reason god in judgement just subjects him from without to violent lords who oft as undeservedly enthrall his outward freedom tyrannie must be though to the tyrant thereby no excuse yet somtimes nations will decline so low from vertue which is reason that no wrong but justice and some fatal curse annext deprives them of thir outward libertie thir inward lost witness th irreverent son of him who built the ark who for the shame don to his father heard this heavie curse servant of seruants on his vitious race thus will this latter as the former world still tend from bad to worse till god at last wearied with their iniquities withdraw his presence from among them and avert his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth to leave them to thir own polluted wayes and one peculiar nation to select from all the rest of whom to be invok 'd a nation from one faithful man to spring him on this side euphrates yet residing bred up in idol-worship o that men canst thou believe should be so stupid grown while yet the patriark liv 'd who scap 'd the flood as to forsake the living god and fall to worship thir own work in wood and stone for gods yet him god the most high voutsafes to call by vision from his fathers house his kindred and false gods into a land which he will shew him and from him will raise a mightie nation and upon him showre his benediction so that in his seed all nations shall be blest he straight obeys not knowing to what land yet firm believes i see him but thou canst not with what faith he leaves his gods his friends and native soile ur of chaldaea passing now the ford to haran after him a cumbrous train of herds and flocks and numerous servitude not wandring poor but trusting all his wealth with god who call 'd him in a land unknown canaan he now attains i see

who shall bruise the serpents head whereof to thee anon plainlier shall be reveald this patriarch blest whom faithful abraham due time shall call a son and of his son a grand-childe leaves like him in faith in wisdom and renown the grandchilde with twelve sons increast departs from canaan to a land hereafter call'd egypt divided by the river nile see where it flows disgorging at seaven mouthes into

growing into a nation and now grown suspected to a sequent king who seeks to stop thir overgrowth as inmate guests too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves inhospitably and kills thir infant males till by two brethren those two brethren call moses and aaron sent from god to claime his people from enthralment they return with glory and spoile back to thir promis 'd land but first the lawless tyrant who denies to know thir god or message to regard must be compelld by signes and judgements dire to blood unshed the rivers must be turnd frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill with loath 'd intrusion and fill all the land his cattel must of rot and murren die botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss and all his people thunder mixt with haile haile mixt with fire must rend th egyptian skie and wheel on th earth devouring where it rouls what it devours not herb or fruit or graine a darksom cloud of locusts swarming down must eat and on the ground leave nothing green darkness must overshadow all his bounds palpable darkness and blot out three dayes last with one midnight stroke all the first-born of egypt must lie dead thus with ten wounds the river-dragon tam 'd at length submits to let his sojourners depart and oft humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice more hard'nd after thaw till in his rage pursuing whom he late dismissd the sea swallows him with his host but them lets pass as on drie land between two christal walls aw 'd by the rod of moses so to stand divided till his rescu 'd gain thir shoar such wondrous power god to his saint will lend though present in his angel who shall goe before them in a cloud and pillar of fire by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire to guide them in thir journey and remove behinde them while th obdurat king pursues all night he will pursue but his approach darkness defends between till morning watch then through the firey pillar and the cloud god looking forth will trouble all his host and craze thir chariot wheels when by command moses once more his potent rod extends over the sea the sea his rod obeys on thir imbattelld ranks the waves return and overwhelm thir warr the race elect safe towards canaan from the shoar advance through the wilde desert not the readiest way least entring on the canaanite allarmd warr terrifie them inexpert and feare return them back to egypt choosing rather inglorious life with servitude for life to noble and ignoble is more sweet untraind in armes where rashness leads not on this also shall they gain by thir delay in the wide wilderness there they shall found thir government and thir great senate choose through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordaind god from the mount of sinai whose gray top shall tremble he descending will himself in thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound ordaine them lawes part such as appertaine to civil justice part religious rites of sacrifice informing them by types and shadows of that destind seed to bruise the serpent by what means he shall achieve mankinds deliverance but the voice of god to mortal eare is dreadful they beseech that moses might report to them his will and terror cease he grants what they besaught instructed that to god is no access without mediator whose high office now moses in figure beares to introduce one greater of whose day he shall foretell and all the prophets in thir age the times of great messiah shall sing thus laws and rites establisht such delight hath god in men obedient to his will that he voutsafes among them to set up his tabernacle the holy one with mortal men to dwell by his prescript a sanctuary is fram'd of cedar overlaid with gold therein an ark and in the ark his testimony the records of his cov'nant over these a mercie-seat of gold between the wings of two bright cherubim before him burn seaven lamps as in a zodiac representing the heav'nly fires over the tent a cloud shall rest by day a fiery gleame by night save when they journie and at length they come conducted by his angel to the land promisd to abraham and his seed the rest were long to tell how many battels fought how many kings destroyd and kingdoms won or how the sun shall in mid heav'n stand still a day entire and nights due course adjourne mans voice commanding sun in gibeon stand and thou moon in the vale of aialon till israel overcome so call the third from abraham son of isaac and from him his whole descent who thus shall canaan win here adam interpos 'd o sent from heav'n enlightner of my darkness gracious things thou hast reveald those chiefly which concerne just abraham and his seed now first i finde mine eyes true op'ning and my heart much eas 'd erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom of mee and all mankind but now i see his day in whom all nations shall be blest favour unmerited by me who sought forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means this yet i apprehend not why to those among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth so many and so various laws are giv'n so many laws argue so many sins among them how can god with such reside to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin will reign among them as of thee begot and therefore was law given them to evince thir natural pravitie by stirring up sin against law to fight that when they see law can discover sin but not remove save by those shadowie expiations weak the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude some bloud more precious must be paid for man just for unjust that in such righteousness to them by faith imputed they may finde justification towards god and peace of conscience which the law by ceremonies can not appease nor man the moral part perform and not performing can not live so law appears imperfet and but giv'n with purpose to resign them in full time up to a better cov'nant disciplin'd from shadowie types to truth from flesh to spirit from imposition of strict laws to free acceptance of large grace from servil fear to filial works of law to works of faith and therefore shall not moses though of god highly belov 'd being but the minister of law his people into canaan lead but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call his name and office bearing who shall quell the adversarie serpent and bring back through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man safe to eternal paradise of rest meanwhile they in thir earthly canaan plac't long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins national interrupt thir public peace provoking god to raise them enemies from whom as oft he saves them penitent by judges first then under kings of whom the second both for pietie renownd and puissant deeds a promise shall receive irrevocable that his regal throne for ever shall endure the like shall sing all prophecie that of the royal stock of david so i name this king shall rise a son the womans seed to thee foretold foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust all nations and to kings foretold of kings the last for of his reign shall be no end but first a long succession must ensue and his next son for wealth and wisdom fam 'd the clouded ark of god till then in tents wandring shall in a glorious temple enshrine such follow him as shall be registerd part good part bad of bad the longer scrowle whose foul idolatries and other faults heapt to the popular summe will so incense god as to leave them and expose thir land thir citie his temple and his holy ark with all his sacred things a scorn and prey to that proud citie whose high walls thou saw'st left in confusion babylon thence call 'd there in captivitie he lets them dwell the space of seventie years then brings them back remembring mercie and his cov'nant sworn to david stablisht as the dayes of heav'n returnd from babylon by leave of kings thir lords whom god dispos 'd the house of god they first re-edifie and for a while in mean estate live moderate till grown in wealth and multitude factious they grow but first among the priests dissension springs men who attend the altar and should most endeavour peace thir strife pollution brings upon the temple it self at last they seise the scepter and regard not davids sons then loose it to a stranger that the true anointed king messiah might be born barr 'd of his right yet at his birth a starr unseen before in heav'n proclaims him com and guides the eastern sages who enquire his place to offer incense myrrh and gold his place of birth a solemn angel tells to simple shepherds keeping watch by night they gladly thither haste and by a quire of squadrond angels hear his carol sung a virgin is his mother but his sire the power of the most high he shall ascend the throne hereditarie and bound his reign with earths wide bounds his glory with the heav'ns he ceas 'd discerning adam with such joy surcharg 'd as had like grief bin dew 'd in tears without the vent of words which these he breathd o prophet of glad tidings finisher of utmost hope now clear i understand what oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain why our great expectation should be call'd the seed of woman virgin mother haile high in the love of heav'n yet from my loynes thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son of god most high so god with man unites needs must the serpent now his capital bruise expect with mortal paine say where and when thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel to whom thus michael dream not of thir fight as of a duel or the local wounds of head or heel not therefore joynes the son manhood to god-head with more strength to foil thy enemie nor so is overcome satan whose fall from heav'n a deadlier bruise disabl 'd not to give thee thy deaths wound which hee who comes thy saviour shall recure not by destroying satan but his works in thee and in thy seed nor can this be but by fulfilling that which thou didst want obedience to the law of god impos'd on penaltie of death and suffering death the penaltie to thy transgression due and due to theirs which out of thine will grow so onely can high justice rest appaid the law of god exact he shall fulfill both by obedience and by love though love alone fulfill the law thy punishment he shall endure by coming in the flesh to a reproachful life and cursed death proclaiming life to all who shall believe in his redemption and that his obedience imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits to save them not thir own though legal works for this he shall live hated be blasphem 'd seis 'd on by force judg 'd and to death condemnd a shameful and accurst naild to the cross by his own nation slaine for bringing life but to the cross he nailes thy enemies the law that is against thee and the sins of all mankinde with him there crucifi 'd never to hurt them more who rightly trust in this his satisfaction so he dies but soon revives death over him no power shall long usurp ere the third dawning light returne the starres of morn shall see him rise out of his grave fresh as the dawning light thy ransom paid which man from death redeems his death for man as many as offerd life neglect not and the benefit imbrace by faith not void of workes this god-like act annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dy 'd in sin for ever lost from life this act shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength defeating sin and death his two maine armes and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep a gentle wafting to immortal life nor after resurrection shall he stay longer on earth then certaine times to appeer to his disciples men who in his life still follow 'd him to them shall leave in charge to teach all nations what of him they learn'd and his salvation them who shall beleeve baptizing in the profluent stream the signe of washing them from guilt of sin to life pure and in mind prepar 'd if so befall for death like that which the redeemer dy 'd all nations they shall teach for from that day not onely to the sons of abrahams loines salvation shall be preacht but to the sons of abrahams faith wherever through the world so in his seed all nations shall be blest then to the heav'n of heav'ns he shall ascend with victory triumphing through the aire over his foes and thine there shall surprise the serpent prince of aire and drag in chaines through all his realme and there confounded leave then enter into glory and resume his seat at gods right hand exalted high above all names in heav'n and thence shall come when this worlds disolution shall be ripe with glory and power to judge both quick and dead to judge th unfaithful dead but to reward his faithful and receave them into bliss whether in heav'n or earth for then the earth shall all be paradise far happier place then this of eden and far happier daies so spake th archangel michael then paus 'd as at the worlds great period and our sire replete with joy and wonder thus repli 'd o goodness infinite goodness immense that all this good of evil shall produce and evil turn to good more wonderful then that which by creation first brought forth light out of darkness full of doubt i stand whether i should repent me now of sin by mee done and occasiond or rejoyce much more that much more good thereof shall spring to god more glory more good will to men from god and over wrauth grace shall abound but say if our deliverer up to heav'n must reascend what will betide the few his faithful left among th unfaithful herd the enemies of truth who then shall guide his people who defend will they not deale wors with his followers then with him they dealt be sure they will said th angel but from heav'n hee to his own a comforter will send the promise of the father who shall dwell his spirit within them and the law of faith working through love upon thir hearts shall write to guide them in all truth and also arme with spiritual armour able to resist satans assaults and quench his fierie darts what man can do against them not affraid though to the death against such cruelties with inward consolations recompenc't and oft supported so as shall amaze thir proudest persecuters for the spirit powrd first on his apostles whom he sends to evangelize the nations then on all baptiz 'd shall them with wondrous gifts endue to speak all tongues and do all miracles as did thir lord before them thus they win great numbers of each nation to receave with joy the tidings brought from heav'n at length thir ministry perform 'd and race well run thir doctrine and thir story written left they die but in thir room as they forewarne wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves who all the sacred mysteries of heav'n to thir own vile advantages shall turne of lucre and ambition and the truth with superstitions and traditions taint left onely in those written records pure though not but by the spirit understood then shall they seek to avail themselves of names places and titles and with these to joine secular power though feigning still to act by spiritual to themselves appropriating the spirit of god promisd alike and giv'n to all beleevers and from that pretense spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force on every conscience laws which none shall finde left them inrould or what the spirit within shall on the heart engrave what will they then but force the spirit of grace it self and binde his consort libertie what but unbuild his living temples built by faith to stand thir own faith not anothers for on earth who against faith and conscience can be heard infallible yet many will presume whence heavie persecution shall arise on all who in the worship persevere of spirit and truth the rest farr greater part will deem in outward rites and specious formes religion satisfi 'd truth shall retire bestuck with slandrous darts and works of faith rarely be found so shall the world goe on to good malignant to bad men benigne under her own waight groaning till the day appeer of respiration to the just and vengeance to the wicked at return of him so lately promis 'd to thy aid the womans seed obscurely then foretold now amplier known thy saviour and thy lord last in the clouds from heav'n to be reveald in glory of the father to dissolve satan with his perverted world then raise from the conflagrant mass purg 'd and refin 'd new heav'ns new earth ages of endless date founded in righteousness and peace and love to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss he ended and thus adam last reply 'd how soon hath thy prediction seer blest measur 'd this transient world the race of time till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss eternitie whose end no eye can reach greatly instructed i shall hence depart greatly in peace of thought and have my fill of knowledge what this vessel can containe beyond which was my folly to aspire henceforth i learne that to obey is best and love with fear the onely god to walk as in his presence ever to observe his providence and on him sole depend mercifull over all his works with good still overcoming evil and by small accomplishing great things by things deemd weak subverting worldly strong and worldly wise by simply meek that suffering for truths sake is fortitude to highest victorie and to the faithful death the gate of life taught this by his example whom i now acknowledge my redeemer ever blest to whom thus also th angel last repli 'd this having learnt thou hast attaind the summe of wisdome hope no higher though all the starrs thou knewst by name and all th ethereal powers all secrets of the deep all natures works or works of god in heav'n aire earth or sea and all the riches of this world enjoydst and all the rule one empire onely add deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith add vertue patience temperance add love by name to come call 'd charitie the soul of all the rest then wilt thou not be loath to leave this paradise but shalt possess a paradise within thee happier farr let us descend now therefore from this top of speculation for the hour precise exacts our parting hence and see the guards by mee encampt on yonder hill expect thir motion at whose front a flaming sword in signal of remove waves fiercely round we may no longer stay go waken eve her also i with gentle dreams have calm'd portending good and all her spirits compos'd to meek submission thou at season fit let her with thee partake what thou hast heard chiefly what may concern her faith to know the great deliverance by her seed to come for by the womans seed on all mankind that ye may live which will be many dayes both in one faith unanimous though sad with cause for evils past yet much more cheer'd with meditation on the happie end he ended and they both descend the hill descended adam to the bowre where eve lay sleeping ran before but found her wak't and thus with words not sad she him receav 'd whence thou returnst and whither wentst i know for god is also in sleep and dreams advise which he hath sent propitious some great good presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress wearied i fell asleep but now lead on in mee is no delay with thee to goe is to stay here without thee here to stay is to go hence unwilling thou to mee art all things under heav'n all places thou who for my wilful crime art banisht hence this further consolation yet secure i carry hence though all by mee is lost such favour i unworthie am voutsaft by mee the promis 'd seed shall all restore so spake our mother eve and adam heard well pleas 'd but answer 'd not for now too nigh th archangel stood and from the other hill to thir fixt station all in bright array the cherubim descended on the ground gliding meteorous as ev'ning mist ris'n from a river o 're the marish glides and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel homeward returning high in front advanc't the brandisht sword of god before them blaz'd fierce as a comet which with torrid heat and vapour as the libyan air adust began to parch that temperate clime whereat in either hand the hastning angel caught our lingring parents and to th eastern gate led them direct and down the cliff as fast to the subjected plaine then disappeer 'd they looking back all th eastern side beheld of paradise so late thir happie seat wav 'd over by that flaming brand the gate with dreadful faces throng 'd and fierie armes som natural tears they drop 'd but wip 'd them soon the world was all before them where to choose thir place of rest and providence thir guide they hand in hand with wandring steps and slow through eden took thir solitarie way

thracian bard in rhodope where woods and rocks had eares to rapture till the savage clamor dround both harp and voice nor could the muse defend her son so fail not thou who thee implores for thou are heav'nlie shee an emptie dreame say goddess what ensu 'd when raphael the affable arch-angel had forewarn'd adam by dire example to beware apostasie by what befell in heaven to those apostates least the like befall in paradise to adam or his race charg 'd not to touch the interdicted tree if they transgress and slight that sole command so easily obeyd amid the choice of all tastes else to please thir appetite though wandring he with his consorted eve the storie heard attentive and was fill'd with admiration and deep muse to hear of things so high and strange things to thir thought so unimaginable as hate in heav'n and warr so neer the peace of god in bliss with such confusion but the evil soon driv'n back redounded as a flood on those from whom it sprung impossible to mix with blessedness whence adam soon repeal'd the doubts that in his heart arose and now led on yet sinless with desire to know what neerer might concern him how this world of heav'n and earth conspicious first began when and whereof created for what cause what within eden or without was done before his memorie as one whose drouth yet scarce allay 'd still eyes the current streame whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites proceeded thus to ask his heav'nly guest great things and full of wonder in our eares farr differing from this world thou hast reveal'd divine interpreter by favour sent down from the empyrean to forewarne us timely of what might else have bin our loss unknown which human knowledg could not reach for which to the infinitly good we owe immortal thanks and his admonishment receave with solemne purpose to observe immutably his sovran will the end of what we are but since thou hast voutsaf't gently for our instruction to impart things above earthly thought which yet concernd our knowing as to highest wisdom seemd deign to descend now lower and relate what may no less perhaps availe us known how first began this heav'n which we behold distant so high with moving fires adornd innumerable and this which yeelds or fills all space the ambient aire wide interfus'd imbracing round this florid earth what cause mov 'd the creator in his holy rest through all eternitie so late to build in chaos and the work begun how soon absolv 'd if unforbid thou maist unfould what wee not to explore the secrets aske of his eternal empire but the more to magnifie his works the more we know and the great light of day yet wants to run much of his race though steep suspens in heav'n held by thy voice thy potent voice he heares and longer will delay to heare thee tell his generation and the rising birth of nature from the unapparent deep or if the starr of eevning and the moon haste to thy audience night with her will bring silence and sleep listning to thee will watch or we can bid his absence till thy song end and dismiss thee ere the morning shine thus adam his illustrious guest besought and thus the godlike angel answerd milde this also thy request with caution askt obtaine though to recount almightie works what words or tongue of seraph can suffice or heart of man suffice to comprehend yet what thou canst attain which best may serve to glorifie the maker and inferr thee also happier shall not be withheld thy hearing such commission from above i have receav 'd to answer thy desire of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain to ask nor let thine own inventions hope things not reveal 'd which th invisible king onely omniscient hath supprest in night to none communicable in earth or heaven anough is left besides to search and know but knowledge is as food and needs no less her temperance over appetite to know in measure what the mind may well contain oppresses else with surfet and soon turns wisdom to folly as nourishment to winde know then that after lucifer from heav'n so call him brighter once amidst the host of angels then that starr the starrs among fell with his flaming legions through the deep into his place and the great son returnd victorious with his saints th omnipotent eternal father from his throne beheld thir multitude and to his son thus spake at least our envious foe hath fail 'd who thought all like himself rebellious by whose aid this inaccessible high strength the seat of deitie supream us dispossest he trusted to have seis 'd and into fraud drew many whom thir place knows here no more yet farr the

though i uncircumscrib 'd my self retire and put not forth my goodness which is free to act or not necessitie and chance approach not mee and what i will is fate so spake th almightie and to what he spake his word the filial godhead gave effect immediate are the acts of god more swift then time or motion but to human ears can not without process of speech be told so told as earthly notion can

forth spontaneous for within them spirit livd attendant on thir lord heav'n op'nd wide her ever during gates harmonious sound on golden hinges moving to let forth the king of glorie in his powerful word and spirit coming to create new worlds on heav'nly ground they stood and from the shore they view 'd the vast immeasurable abyss outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wilde up from the bottom turn 'd by furious windes and surging waves as mountains to assault heav'ns highth and with the center mix the pole silence ye troubl 'd waves and thou deep peace said then th omnific word your discord end

creation and the wonders of his might then staid the fervid wheeles and in his hand he took the golden compasses prepar'd in gods eternal store to circumscribe this universe and all created things one

fluid mass but downward purg'd the black tartareous cold infernal dregs adverse to life then founded then conglob'd like things to like the rest to several place disparted and between spun out the air and earth self ballanc't on her center hung let ther be light said god and forthwith light ethereal first of things quintessence pure sprung from the deep and from her native east to journie through the airie gloom began sphear 'd in a radiant cloud for yet the sun was not shee in a cloudie tabernacle sojourn 'd the while god saw the light was good and light from darkness by the hemisphere divided light the day and darkness night he nam 'd thus was the first day eev'n and morn nor past uncelebrated nor unsung by the celestial quires when orient light exhaling first from darkness they beheld birth-day of heav'n and earth with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they fill 'd and touch't thir golden harps and hymning prais'd god and his works creatour him they sung both when first eevning was and when first morn again god said let ther be firmament amid the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament expanse of liquid pure transparent elemental air diffus'd in circuit to the uttermost convex of this great round partition firm and sure the waters underneath from those above dividing for as earth so he the world built on circumfluous waters calme in wide crystallin ocean and the loud misrule of chaos farr remov 'd least fierce extreames contiguous might distemper the whole frame and heav'n he nam 'd the firmament so eev'n and

prolific humour soft'ning all her globe fermented the great mother to conceave satiate with genial moisture when god said be gather 'd now ye waters under heav'n into one place and let dry land appeer immediately the mountains huge appeer emergent and thir broad bare backs upheave into the clouds thir tops ascend the skie so high as heav 'd the tumid hills so low down sunk a hollow bottom broad and

channels wore easie e 're god had bid the ground be drie all but within those banks where rivers now stream and perpetual draw thir humid traine the dry land earth and the great receptacle of congregated waters he call 'd seas and saw that it was good and said let th earth put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after her kind whose seed is in her self upon the earth he scarce had said when the bare earth till then desert and bare unsightly unadorn 'd brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad her universal face with pleasant green then herbs of every leaf that sudden flour'd op'ning thir various colours and made gay her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown forth flourish't thick the clustring vine forth crept the smelling gourd up stood the cornie reed embattell 'd in her field and the humble shrub and bush with frizl 'd hair implicit last rose as in dance the stately trees and spred thir branches hung with copious fruit or gemm'd thir blossoms with high woods the hills were crownd with tufts the vallies and each fountain side with borders long the rivers that earth now seemd like to heav'n a seat where gods might dwell

ground and each plant of the field which e 're it was in the earth god made and every herb before it grew on the green stemm god saw that it was good so eev'n and morn recorded the third day again th almightie spake let there be lights high in th expanse of heaven to divide the day from night and let them be for signes for seasons and for dayes and circling years and let them be for lights as i ordaine thir office in the firmament of heav'n to give light on the earth and it was so and god made two great lights great for thir use to man the greater to have rule by day the less by night alterne and made the starrs and set them in the firmament of heav'n to illuminate the earth and rule the day in thir vicissitude and rule the night and light from darkness to divide god saw surveying his great work that it was good for of celestial bodies first the sun a mightie spheare he fram 'd unlightsom first though of ethereal mould then form 'd the moon globose and every magnitude of starrs

was a place now not though sin not time first wraught the change where tigris at the foot of paradise into a gulf shot under ground till part rose up a fountain by the tree of life in with the river

antartic and in length west from orontes to the ocean barr'd at darien thence to the land where flowes ganges and indus thus the orb he roam'd with narrow search and with inspection deep consider 'd every creature which of all most opportune might serve his wiles and found the serpent suttlest beast of all the field him after long debate irresolute of thoughts revolv 'd his final sentence chose

of creatures animate with gradual life of growth sense reason all summ 'd up in man with what delight could i have walkt thee round if i could joy in aught sweet interchange of hill and vallie rivers woods and plaines now land now sea and shores with forrest crownd rocks dens and caves but i in none of these find place or refuge and the more i see pleasures about me so much more i feel torment within me as from the hateful siege of contraries all good to me becomes bane and in heav'n much worse would be my state but neither here seek i no nor in heav'n to dwell unless by maistring heav'ns supreame nor hope to be my self less miserable by what i seek but others to make such as i though thereby worse to me redound for onely in destroying i find ease to my relentless thoughts and him destroyd or won to what may work his utter loss for whom all this was made all this will soon follow as to him linkt in weal or woe in wo then that destruction wide may range to mee shall be the

whether such vertue spent of old now faild more angels to create if they at least are his created or to spite us more determin 'd to advance into our room a creature form 'd of earth and him endow

enterd and his brutal sense in heart or head possessing soon inspir'd with act intelligential but his sleep disturbd not waiting close th approach of morn now when as sacred light began to dawne in eden on the humid flours that breathd thir morning incense when all things that breath from th earths great altar send up silent praise to the creator and his nostrils fill with grateful smell forth came the human pair and joind thir vocal worship to the quire of creatures wanting voice that done partake the season prime for sweetest sents and aires then commune how that day they best may ply thir growing work for much thir work outgrew the hands dispatch of two gardning so wide and eve first to her husband thus began adam well may we labour still to dress this garden still to tend plant herb and flour our pleasant task enjoyn 'd but till more hands aid us the work under our labour grows luxurious by restraint what we by day lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind one night or two with wanton growth derides tending to wilde thou therefore now advise or hear what to my minde first thoughts present let us divide our labours thou where choice leads thee or where most needs whether to wind the woodbine round this arbour or direct the clasping ivie where to climb while i in yonder spring of roses intermixt with myrtle find what to redress till noon for while so near each other thus all day our taske we choose what wonder if so near looks intervene and smiles or object new casual discourse draw on which intermits our dayes work brought to little though begun early and th hour of supper comes unearn 'd to whom mild answer adam thus return 'd sole eve associate sole to me beyond compare above all living creatures deare well hast thou motion 'd well thy thoughts imployd how we might best fulfill the work which here god hath assign 'd us nor of me shalt pass unprais 'd for nothing lovelier can be found in woman then to studie houshold good and good workes in her husband to promote yet not so strictly hath our lord impos'd labour as to debarr us when we need refreshment whether food or talk between food of the mind or this sweet intercourse of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow to brute deni 'd and are of love the food love not the lowest end of human life for not to irksom toile but to delight he made us and delight to reason joyn 'd these paths bowers doubt not but our joynt hands will keep from wilderness with ease as wide as we need walk till younger hands ere long assist us but if much converse perhaps thee satiate to short absence i could yield for solitude somtimes is best societie and short retirement urges sweet returne but other doubt possesses me least harm befall thee sever 'd from me for thou knowst what hath bin warn 'd us what malicious foe envying our happiness and of his own despairing seeks to work us woe and shame by sly assault and somwhere nigh at hand watches no doubt with greedy hope to find his wish and best advantage us asunder hopeless to circumvent us joynd where each to other speedie aide might lend at need whether his first design be to withdraw our fealtie from god or to disturb conjugal love then which perhaps no bliss enjoy 'd by us excites his envie more or this or worse leave not the faithful side that gave thee being still shades thee and protects the wife where danger or dishonour lurks safest and seemliest by her husband staies who guards her or with her the worst endures to whom the virgin majestie of eve as one who loves and some unkindness meets with sweet austeer composure thus reply 'd ofspring of heav'n and earth and all earths lord that such an enemie we have who seeks our ruin both by thee informd i learne and from the parting angel over-heard as in a shadie nook i stood behind just then returnd at shut of evening flours but that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt to god or thee because we have a foe may tempt it i expected not to hear his violence thou fearst not being such as wee not capable of death or paine can either not receave or can repell his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs thy equal fear that my firm faith and love can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't thoughts which how found they harbour in thy brest adam missthought of her to thee so dear to whom with healing words adam replyd daughter of god and man immortal eve for such thou art from sin and blame entire not diffident of thee do i dissuade thy absence from my sight but to avoid th attempt it self intended by our foe for hee who tempts though in vain at least asperses the tempted with dishonour foul suppos'd not incorruptible of faith not prooff against temptation thou thy self with scorne and anger wouldst resent the offer 'd wrong though ineffectual found misdeem not then if such affront i labour to avert from thee alone which on us both at once the enemie though bold will hardly dare or daring first on mee th assault shall light nor thou his malice and false guile contemn suttle he needs must be who could seduce angels nor think superfluous others aid i from the influence of thy looks receave access in every vertue in thy sight more wise more watchful stronger if need were of outward strength while shame thou looking on shame to be overcome or over-reacht would utmost vigor raise and rais 'd unite why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel when i am present and thy trial choose with me best witness of thy vertue tri 'd so spake domestick adam in his care and matrimonial love but eve who thought less attributed to her faith sincere thus her reply with accent sweet renewd if this be our condition thus to dwell in narrow circuit strait'nd by a foe suttle or violent we not endu'd single with like defence wherever met how are we happie still in fear of harm but harm precedes not sin onely our foe tempting affronts us with his foul esteem of our integritie his foul esteeme sticks no dishonour on our front but turns foul on himself then wherefore shund or feard by us who rather double honour gaine from his surmise prov 'd false find peace within favour from heav'n our witness from th event and what is faith love vertue unassaid alone without exterior help sustaind let us not then suspect our happie state left so imperfet by the maker wise as not secure to single or combin 'd fraile is our happiness if this be so and eden were no eden thus expos 'd to whom thus adam fervently repli 'd o woman best are all things as the will of god ordain 'd them his creating hand nothing imperfet or deficient left of all that he created much less man or aught that might his happie state secure secure from outward force within himself the danger lies yet lies within his power against his will he can receave no harme but god left free the will for what obeyes reason is free and reason he made right but bid her well beware and still erect least by some faire appeering good surpris'd she dictate false and misinforme the will to do what god expressly hath forbid not then mistrust but tender love enjoynes that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me firm we subsist yet possible to swerve since reason not impossibly may meet some specious object by the foe subornd and fall into deception unaware not keeping strictest watch as she was warnd seek not temptation then which to avoide were better and most likelie if from mee thou sever not trial will come unsought wouldst thou approve thy constancie approve first thy obedience th other who can know not seeing thee attempted who attest but if thou think trial unsought may finde us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst go for thy stay not free absents thee more go in thy native innocence relie on what thou hast of vertue summon all for god towards thee hath done his part do thine so spake the patriarch of mankinde but eve persisted yet submiss though last repli 'd with thy permission then and thus forewarnd chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words touchd onely that our trial when least sought may finde us both perhaps farr less prepar 'd the willinger i goe nor much expect a foe so proud will first the weaker seek so bent the more shall shame him his repulse thus saying from her husbands hand her hand soft she withdrew and like a wood-nymph light oread or dryad or of delia 's traine betook her to the groves but delia 's self in gate surpass 'd and goddess-like deport though not as shee with bow and quiver armd but with such gardning tools as art yet rude guiltless of fire had formd or angels brought to pales or pomona thus adornd likeliest she seemd pomona when she fled vertumnus or to ceres in her prime yet virgin of proserpina from jove her long with ardent look his eye pursu'd delighted but desiring more her stay oft he to her his charge of quick returne repeated shee to him as oft engag'd to be returnd by noon amid the bowre and all things in best order to invite noontide repast or afternoons repose o much deceav 'd much failing hapless eve of thy presum 'd return event perverse thou never from that houre in paradise foundst either sweet repast or sound repose such ambush hid among sweet flours and shades waited with hellish rancour imminent to intercept thy way or send thee back despoild of innocence of faith of bliss for now and since first break of dawne the fiend meer serpent in appearance forth was come and on his quest where likeliest he might finde the onely two of mankinde but in them the whole included race his purposd prey in bowre and field he sought where any tuft of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay thir tendance or plantation for delight by fountain or by shadie rivulet he sought them both but wish 'd his hap might find eve separate he wish 'd but not with hope of what so seldom chanc 'd when to his wish beyond his hope eve separate he spies veild in a cloud of fragrance where she stood half spi 'd so thick the roses bushing round about her glowd oft stooping to support each flour of slender stalk whose head though gay carnation purple azure or spect with gold hung drooping unsustaind them she upstaies gently with mirtle band mindless the while her self though fairest unsupported flour from her best prop so farr and storm so nigh neerer he drew and many a walk travers'd of stateliest covert cedar pine or palme then voluble and bold now hid now seen among thick-wov'n arborets and flours imborderd on each bank the hand of eve spot more delicious then those gardens feign'd or of reviv 'd adonis or renownd alcinous host of old laertes son or that not mystic where the sapient king held dalliance with his faire egyptian spouse much hee the place admir 'd the person more as one who long in populous city pent where houses thick and sewers annoy the aire forth issuing on a summers morn to breathe among the pleasant villages and farmes adjoynd from each thing met conceaves delight the smell of grain or tedded grass or kine or dairie each rural sight each rural sound if chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass what pleasing seemd for her now pleases more she most and in her look summs all delight such pleasure took the serpent to behold this flourie plat the sweet recess of eve thus earlie thus alone her heav'nly forme angelic but more soft and feminine her graceful innocence her every aire of gesture or lest action overawd his malice and with rapine sweet bereav'd his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought that space the evil one abstracted stood from his own evil and for the time remaind stupidly good of enmitie disarm 'd of guile of hate of envie of revenge but the hot hell that alwayes in him burnes though in mid heav'n soon ended his delight and tortures him now more the more he sees of pleasure not for him ordain 'd then soon fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts of mischief gratulating thus excites thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet compulsion thus transported to forget what hither brought us hate not love nor hope of paradise for hell hope here to taste of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy save what is in destroying other joy to me is lost then let me not let pass occasion which now smiles behold alone the woman opportune to all attempts her husband for i view far round not nigh whose higher intellectual more i shun and strength of courage hautie and of limb heroic built though of terrestrial mould foe not informidable exempt from wound i not so much hath hell debas 'd and paine infeebl 'd me to what i was in heav'n shee fair divinely fair fit love for gods not terrible though terrour be in love and beautie not approacht by stronger hate hate stronger under shew of love well feign 'd the way which to her ruin now i tend so spake the enemie of mankind enclos'd in serpent inmate bad and toward eve address 'd his way not with indented wave prone on the ground as since but on his reare circular base of rising foulds that tour'd fould above fould a surging maze his head crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes with burnisht neck of verdant gold erect amidst his circling spires that on the grass floted redundant pleasing was his shape and lovely never since of serpent kind lovelier not those that in illyria chang'd hermione and cadmus or the god in epidaurus nor to which transformd ammonian jove or capitoline was seen hee with olympias this with her who bore scipio the highth of rome with tract oblique at first as one who sought access but feard to interrupt side-long he works his way as when a ship by skilful stearsman wrought nigh rivers mouth or foreland where the wind veres oft as oft so steers and shifts her saile so varied hee and of his tortuous traine curld many a wanton wreath in sight of eve to lure her eye shee busied heard the sound of rusling leaves but minded not as us'd to such disport before her through the field from every beast more duteous at her call then at circean call the herd disguis 'd hee boulder now uncall 'd before her stood but as in gaze admiring oft he bowd his turret crest and sleek enamel 'd neck fawning and lick 'd the ground whereon she trod his gentle dumb expression turnd at length the eye of eve to mark his play he glad of her attention gaind with serpent tongue organic or impulse of vocal air his fraudulent temptation thus began wonder not sovran mistress if perhaps thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm thy looks the heav'n of mildness with disdain displeas 'd that i approach thee thus and gaze insatiate i thus single nor have feard thy awful brow more awful thus retir 'd fairest resemblance of thy maker faire thee all things living gaze on all things thine by gift and thy celestial beautie adore with ravishment beheld there best beheld where universally admir 'd but here in this enclosure wild these beasts among beholders rude and shallow to discerne half what in thee is fair one man except who sees thee and what is one who shouldst be seen a goddess among gods ador 'd and serv'd by angels numberless thy daily train so gloz 'd the tempter and his proem tun 'd into the heart of eve his words made way though at the voice much marveling at length not unamaz 'd she thus in answer spake what may this mean language of man pronounc't by tongue of brute and human sense exprest the first at lest of these i thought deni'd to beasts whom god on thir creation-day created mute to all articulat sound the latter i demurre for in thir looks much reason and in thir actions oft appeers thee serpent suttlest beast of all the field i knew but not with human voice endu 'd redouble then this miracle and say how cam'st thou speakable of mute and how to me so friendly grown above the rest of brutal kind that daily are in sight say for such wonder claims attention due to whom the guileful tempter thus reply 'd empress of this fair world resplendent eve easie to mee it is to tell thee all what thou commandst and right thou shouldst be obeyd i was at first as other beasts that graze the trodden herb of abject thoughts and low as was my food nor aught but food discern'd or sex and apprehended nothing high till on a day roaving the field i chanc'd a goodly tree farr distant to behold loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt ruddie and gold i nearer drew to gaze when from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n grateful to appetite more pleas 'd my sense then smell of sweetest fenel or the teats of ewe or goat dropping with milk at eevn unsuckt of lamb or kid that tend thir play to satisfie the sharp desire i had of tasting those fair apples i resolv'd not to deferr hunger and thirst at once powerful perswaders quick'nd at the scent of that alluring fruit urg 'd me so keene about the mossie trunk i wound me soon for high from ground the branches would require thy utmost reach or adams round the

though to this shape retain 'd thenceforth to speculations high or deep i turnd my thoughts and with capacious mind considerd all things visible in heav'n or earth or middle all things fair and good but all that fair and good in thy divine semblance and in thy beauties heav'nly ray united i beheld no fair to thine equivalent or second which compel'd mee thus though importune perhaps to come and gaze and worship thee of right declar'd sovran of creatures universal dame so talk 'd the spirited sly snake and eve yet more amaz 'd unwarie thus reply 'd serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt the vertue of that fruit in thee first prov 'd but say where grows the tree from hence how far for many are the trees of god that grow in paradise and various yet unknown to us in such aboundance lies our choice as leaves a greater store of fruit untoucht still hanging incorruptible till men grow up to thir provision and more hands help to disburden nature of her bearth to whom the wilie adder blithe and glad empress the way is readie and not long beyond a row of myrtles on a flat fast by a fountain one small thicket past of blowing myrrh and balme if thou accept my conduct i can bring thee thither soon lead then said eve hee leading swiftly rowld in tangles and made intricate seem strait to mischief swift hope elevates and joy bright'ns his crest as when a wandring fire compact of unctuous vapor which the night condenses and the cold invirons round kindl 'd through agitation to a flame which oft they say some evil spirit attends hovering and blazing with delusive light misleads th amaz 'd night-wanderer from his way to boggs and mires and oft through pond or poole there swallow 'd up and lost from succour farr so glister 'd the dire snake and into fraud led eve our credulous mother to the tree of prohibition root of all our woe which when she saw thus to her guide she spake serpent we might have spar 'd our coming hither fruitless to mee though fruit be here to excess the credit of whose vertue rest with thee wondrous indeed if cause of such effects but of this tree we may not taste nor touch god so commanded and left that command sole daughter of his voice the rest we live law to our selves our reason is our law to whom the tempter guilefully repli 'd indeed hath god then said that of the fruit of all these garden trees ye shall not eate yet lords declar 'd of all in earth or aire to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit of each tree in the garden we may eate but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst the garden god hath said ye shall not eate thereof nor shall ye touch it least ye die she scarse had said though brief when now more bold the tempter but with shew of zeale and love to man and indignation at his wrong new part puts on and as to passion mov 'd fluctuats disturbd yet comely and in act rais 'd as of som great matter to begin as when of old som orator renound in athens or free rome where eloquence flourishd since mute to som great cause addrest stood in himself collected while each part motion each act won audience ere the tongue somtimes in highth began as no delay of preface brooking through his zeal of right so standing moving or to highth upgrown the tempter all impassiond thus began o sacred wise and wisdom-giving plant mother of science now i feel thy power within me cleere not onely to discerne things in thir causes but to trace the wayes of highest agents deemd however wise queen of this universe doe not believe those rigid threats of death ye shall not die how should ye by the fruit it gives you life to knowledge by the threatner look on mee mee who have touch 'd and tasted yet both live and life more perfet have attaind then fate meant mee by ventring higher then my lot shall that be shut to man which to the beast is open or will god incense his ire for such a petty trespass and not praise rather your dauntless vertue whom the pain of death denounc't whatever thing death be deterrd not from atchieving what might leade to happier life knowledge of good and evil of good how just of evil if what is evil be real why not known since easier shunnd god therefore can not hurt ye and be just not just not god not feard then nor obeyd your feare it self of death removes the feare why then was this forbid why but to awe why but to keep ye low and ignorant his worshippers he knows that in the day ye eate thereof your eyes that seem so cleere yet are but dim shall perfetly be then op'nd and cleerd and ye shall be as gods knowing both good and evil as they know that ye should be as gods since i as man internal man is but proportion meet i of brute human yee of human gods so ye shall die perhaps by putting off human to put on gods death to be wisht though threat'nd which no worse then this can bring and what are gods that man may not become as they participating god-like food the gods are first and that advantage use on our belief that all from them proceeds i question it for this fair earth i see warm 'd by the sun producing every kind them nothing if they all things who enclos'd knowledge of good and evil in this tree that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains wisdom without their leave and wherein lies th offence that man should thus attain to know what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree impart against his will if all be his or is it envie and can envie dwell in heav'nly breasts these these and many more causes import your need of this fair fruit goddess humane reach then and freely taste he ended and his words replete with guile into her heart too easie entrance won fixt on the fruit she gaz 'd which to behold might tempt alone and in her ears the sound yet rung of his perswasive words impregn'd with reason to her seeming and with truth mean while the hour of noon drew on and wak'd an eager appetite rais 'd by the smell so savorie of that fruit which with desire inclinable now grown to touch or taste sollicited her longing eye yet first pausing a while thus to her self she mus 'd great are thy vertues doubtless best of fruits though kept from man and worthy to be admir 'd whose taste too long forborn at first assay gave elocution to the mute and taught the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise thy praise hee also who forbids thy use conceales not from us naming thee the tree of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil forbids us then to taste but his forbidding commends thee more while it inferrs the good by thee communicated and our want for good unknown sure is not had or had and yet unknown is as not had at all in plain then what forbids he but to know forbids us good forbids us to be wise such prohibitions binde not but if death bind us with after-bands what profits then our inward freedom in the day we eate of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die how dies the serpent hee hath eat'n and lives and knows and speaks and reasons and discerns irrational till then for us alone was death invented or to us deni'd this intellectual food for beasts reserv 'd for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first hath tasted envies not but brings with joy the good befall'n him author unsuspect friendly to man farr from deceit or guile what fear i then rather what know to feare under this ignorance of good and evil of god or death of law or penaltie here grows the cure of all this fruit divine fair to the eye inviting to the taste of vertue to make wise what hinders then to reach and feed at once both bodie and mind so saying her rash hand in evil hour forth reaching to the fruit she pluck 'd she eat earth felt the wound and nature from her seat sighing through all her works gave signs of woe that all was lost back to the thicket slunk the guiltie serpent and well might for eve intent now wholly on her taste naught else regarded such delight till then as seemd in fruit she never tasted whether true or fansied so through expectation high of knowledg nor was god-head from her thought greedily she ingorg 'd without restraint and knew not eating death satiate at length and hight'nd as with wine jocond and boon thus to her self she pleasingly began o sovran vertuous precious of all trees in paradise of operation blest to sapience hitherto obscur 'd infam 'd and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end created but henceforth my early care not without song each morning and due praise shall tend thee and the fertil burden ease of thy full branches offer 'd free to all till dieted by thee i grow mature in knowledge as the gods who all things know though others envie what they can not give for had the gift bin theirs it had not here thus grown experience next to thee i owe best guide not following thee i had remaind in ignorance thou op'nst wisdoms way and giv'st access though secret she retire and i perhaps am secret heav'n is high high and remote to see from thence distinct each thing on earth and other care perhaps may have diverted from continual watch our great forbidder safe with all his spies about him but to adam in what sort shall i appeer shall i to him make known as yet my change and give him to partake full happiness with mee or rather not but keep the odds of knowledge in my power without copartner so to add what wants in femal sex the more to draw his love and render me more equal and perhaps a thing not undesireable somtime superior for inferior who is free this may be well but what if god have seen and death ensue then i shall be no more and adam wedded to another eve shall live with her enjoying i extinct a death to think confirm 'd then i resolve adam shall share with me in bliss or woe so dear i love him that with him all deaths i could endure without him live no life so saying from the tree her step she turnd but first low reverence don as to the power that dwelt within whose presence had infus'd into the plant sciential sap deriv'd from nectar drink of gods adam the while waiting desirous her return had wove of choicest flours a garland to adorne her tresses and her rural labours crown as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen great joy he promis 'd to his thoughts and new solace in her return so long delay 'd yet oft his heart divine of somthing ill misgave him hee the faultring measure felt and forth to meet her went the way she took that morn when first they parted by the tree of knowledge he must pass there he her met scarse from the tree returning in her hand a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil 'd new gatherd and ambrosial smell diffus 'd to him she hasted in her face excuse came prologue and apologie to prompt which with bland words at will she thus addrest hast thou not wonderd adam at my stay thee i have misst and thought it long depriv'd thy presence agonie of love till now not felt nor shall be twice for never more mean i to trie what rash untri 'd i sought the pain of absence from thy sight but strange hath bin the cause and wonderful to heare this tree is not as we are told a tree of danger tasted nor to evil unknown op'ning the way but of divine effect to open eyes and make them gods who taste and hath bin tasted such the serpent wise or not restraind as wee or not obeying hath eat'n of the fruit and is become not dead as we are threatn 'd but thenceforth endu 'd with human voice and human sense reasoning to admiration and with mee perswasively hath so prevaild that i have also tasted and have also found th effects to correspond opener mine eyes dimm erst dilated spirits ampler heart and growing up to godhead which for thee chiefly i sought without thee can despise for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss tedious unshar 'd with thee and odious soon thou therefore also taste that equal lot may joyne us equal joy as equal love least thou not tasting different degree disjoyne us and i then too late renounce deitie for thee when fate will not permit thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd on th other side adam soon as he heard the fatal trespass don by eve amaz 'd astonied stood and blank while horror chill ran through his veins and all his joynts relax 'd from his slack hand the garland wreath 'd for eve down drop 'd and all the faded roses shed speechless he stood and pale till thus at length first to himself he inward silence broke o fairest of creation last and best of all gods works creature in whom excell'd whatever can to sight or thought be formd holy divine good amiable or sweet how art thou lost how on a sudden lost defac't deflourd and now to death devote rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress the strict forbiddance how to violate the sacred fruit forbidd'n som cursed fraud of enemie hath beguil 'd thee yet unknown and mee with thee hath ruind for with thee certain my resolution is to die how can i live without thee how forgoe thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn 'd to live again in these wilde woods forlorn should god create another eve and i another rib afford yet loss of thee would never from my heart no no i feel the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh bone of my bone thou art and from thy state mine never shall be parted bliss or woe so having said as one from sad dismay recomforted and after thoughts disturbd submitting to what seemd remediless thus in calm mood his words to eve he turnd bold deed thou hast presum 'd adventrous eve and peril great provok't who thus hath dar'd had it been onely coveting to eye that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence much more to taste it under banne to touch but past who can recall or don undoe not god omnipotent nor fate yet so perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact is not so hainous now foretasted fruit profan 'd first by the serpent by him first made common and unhallowd ere our taste nor yet on him found deadly he yet lives lives as thou saidst and gaines to live as man higher degree of life inducement strong to us as likely tasting to attaine proportional ascent which can not be but to be gods or angels demi-gods nor can i think that god creator wise though threatning will in earnest so destroy us his prime creatures dignifi 'd so high set over all his works which in our fall for us created needs with us must faile dependent made so god shall uncreate be frustrate do undo and labour loose not well conceav 'd of god who though his power creation could repeate yet would be loath us to abolish least the adversary triumph and say fickle their state whom god most favors who can please him long mee first he ruind now mankind whom will he next matter of scorne not to be given the foe however i with thee have fixt my lot certain to undergoe like doom if death consort with thee death is to mee as life so forcible within my beart i feel the bond of nature draw me to my owne my own in thee for what thou art is mine our state can not be severd we are one one flesh to loose thee were to loose my self so adam and thus eve to him repli 'd o glorious trial of exceeding love illustrious evidence example high ingaging me to emulate but short of thy perfection how shall i attaine adam from whose deare side i boast me sprung and gladly of our union heare thee speak one heart one soul in both whereof good prooff this day affords declaring thee resolvd rather then death or aught then death more dread shall separate us linkt in love so deare to undergoe with mee one guilt one crime if any be of tasting this fair fruit whose vertue for of good still good proceeds direct or by occasion hath presented this happie trial of thy love which else so eminently never had bin known were it i thought death menac't would ensue this my attempt i would sustain alone the worst and not perswade thee rather die deserted then oblige thee with a fact pernicious to thy peace chiefly assur'd remarkably so late of thy so true so faithful love unequald but i feel farr otherwise th event not death but life augmented op'nd eyes new hopes new joyes taste so divine that what of sweet before hath toucht my sense flat seems to this and harsh on my experience adam freely taste and fear of death deliver to the windes so saying she embrac 'd him and for joy tenderly wept much won that he his love had so enobl 'd as of choice to incurr divine displeasure for her sake or death in recompence for such compliance bad such recompence best merits from the bough she gave him of that fair enticing fruit with liberal hand he scrupl 'd not to eat against his better knowledge not deceav 'd but fondly overcome with femal charm earth trembl 'd from her entrails as again in pangs and nature gave a second groan skie lowr 'd and muttering thunder som sad drops wept at compleating of the mortal sin original while adam took no thought eating his fill nor eve to iterate her former trespass fear 'd the more to soothe him with her lov 'd societie that now as with new wine intoxicated both they swim in mirth and fansie that they feel divinitie within them breeding wings wherewith to scorne the earth but that false fruit farr other operation first displaid carnal desire enflaming hee on eve began to cast lascivious eyes she him as wantonly repaid in lust they burne till adam thus'gan eve to dalliance move eve now i see thou art exact of taste and elegant of sapience no small part since to each meaning savour we apply and palate call judicious i the praise yeild thee so well this day thou hast purvey 'd much pleasure we have lost while we abstain'd from this delightful fruit nor known till now true relish tasting if such pleasure be in things to us forbidden it might be wish 'd for this one tree had bin forbidden ten but come so well refresh't now let us play as meet is after such delicious fare for never did thy beautie since the day i saw thee first and wedded thee adorn'd with all perfections so enflame my sense with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now then ever bountie of this vertuous tree so said he and forbore not glance or toy of amorous intent well understood of eve whose eye darted contagious fire her hand he seis 'd and to a shadie bank thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd he led her nothing loath flours were the couch pansies and violets and asphodel and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap there they thir fill of love and loves disport took largely of thir mutual guilt the seale the solace of thir sin till dewie sleep oppress 'd them wearied with thir amorous play soon as the force of that fallacious fruit that with exhilerating vapour bland about thir spirits had plaid and inmost powers made erre was now exhal 'd and grosser sleep bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams encumberd now had left them up they rose as from unrest and each the other viewing soon found thir eyes how op'nd and thir minds how dark'nd innocence that as a veile had shadow 'd them from knowing ill was gon just confidence and native righteousness and honour from about them naked left to guiltie shame hee cover 'd but his robe uncover 'd more so rose the danite strong herculean samson from the harlot-lap of philistean dalilah and wak'd shorn of his strength they destitute and bare of all thir vertue silent and in face confounded long they sate as struck'n mute till adam though not less then eve abash't at length gave utterance to these words constraind eve in evil hour thou didst give eare to that false worm of whomsoever taught to counterfet mans voice true in our fall false in our promis 'd rising since our eyes op'nd we find indeed and find we know both good and evil good lost and evil got bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know which leaves us naked thus of honour void of innocence of faith of puritie our wonted ornaments now soild and staind and in our faces evident the signes of foul concupiscence whence evil store even shame the last of evils of the first be sure then how shall i behold the face henceforth of god or angel earst with joy and rapture so oft beheld those heav'nly shapes will dazle now this earthly with thir blaze insufferably bright o might i here in solitude live savage in some glade obscur 'd where highest woods impenetrable to starr or sun-light spread thir umbrage broad and brown as evening cover me ye pines ye cedars with innumerable boughs hide me where i may never see them more but let us now as in bad plight devise what best may from the present serve to hide the parts of each for other that seem most to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sowd and girded on our loyns may cover round those middle parts that this new commer shame there sit not and reproach us as unclean so counsel 'd hee and both together went into the thickest wood there soon they chose the figtree not that kind for fruit renown 'd but such as at this day to indians known in malabar or decan spreds her armes braunching so broad and long that in the ground the bended twigs take root and daughters grow about the mother tree a pillard shade high overarch't and echoing walks between there oft the indian herdsman shunning heate shelters in coole and tends his pasturing herds at loopholes cut through thickest shade those leaves they gatherd broad as amazonian targe and with what skill they had together sowd to gird thir waste vain covering if to hide thir guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike to that first naked glorie such of late columbus found th american so girt with featherd cincture naked else and wilde among the trees on iles and woodie shores thus fenc't and as they thought thir shame in part coverd but not at rest or ease of mind they sate them down to weep nor onely teares raind at thir eyes but high winds worse within began to rise high passions anger hate mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore thir inward state of mind calm region once and full of peace now tost and turbulent for understanding rul 'd not and the will heard not her lore both in subjection now to sensual appetite who from beneathe usurping over sovran reason claimd superior sway from thus distemperd brest adam estrang 'd in look and alterd stile speech intermitted thus to eve renewd would thou hadst heark'nd to my words and stai'd with me as i besought thee when that strange desire of wandring this unhappie morn i know not whence possessd thee we had then remaind still happie not as now despoild of all our good sham 'd naked miserable let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve the faith they owe when earnestly they seek such proof conclude they then begin to faile to whom soon mov 'd with touch of blame thus eve what words have past thy lips adam severe imput'st thou that to my default or will of wandring as thou call'st it which who knows but might as ill have happ'nd thou being by or to thy self perhaps hadst thou been there or here th attempt thou couldst not have discernd fraud in the serpent speaking as he spake no ground of enmitie between us known why hee should mean me ill or seek to harme was i to have never parted from thy side as good have grown there still a liveless rib being as i am why didst not thou the head command me absolutely not to go going into such danger as thou saidst too facil then thou didst not much gainsay nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent neither had i transgress 'd nor thou with mee to whom then first incenst adam repli 'd is this the love is this the recompence of mine to thee ingrateful eve exprest immutable when thou wert lost not i who might have liv 'd and joyd immortal bliss yet willingly chose rather death with thee and am i now upbraided as the cause of thy transgressing not enough severe it seems in thy restraint what could i more i warn 'd thee i admonish 'd thee foretold the danger and the lurking enemie that lay in wait beyond this had bin force and force upon free will hath here no place but confidence then bore thee on secure either to meet no danger or to finde matter of glorious trial and perhaps i also err 'd in overmuch admiring what seemd in thee so perfet that i thought no evil durst attempt thee but i rue that errour now which is become my crime and thou th accuser thus it shall befall him who to worth in women overtrusting lets her will rule restraint she will not brook and left to her self if evil thence ensue shee first his weak indulgence will accuse thus they in mutual accusation spent the fruitless hours but neither self-condemning and of thir vain contest appeer 'd no end
what was it like god of mine what was it like —oh unfaithful heart indecisive intelligence was it like the going by of the wind like the disappearance of the spring as nimble as changeable as weightless as milkweed seeds in summer yes indefinite as a smile which is lost forever in a laugh arrogant in the air just like a flag flag smile milkweed pod swift spring in june clear wind your celebration was so wild so sad all of your changes ended up in nothing— remembrance a blind bee of bitter things — i don ’ t know what you were like but you were
the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god ’ s sun-lit waves rolled by and left me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell— oh i was plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints— no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightening shone the face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power

torquemada now that castile and aragon in holy wedlock are spain and the last city of the moors in spain is spanish except for moor and jew— about every crucifix in every market-place and in the court itself the jews — as seven centuries of christian valor christian piety triumph stay not your hand spain of the knights one in fealty to your majesties become one in faith spain of the saints like the sun rising as our savior from his tomb into the brilliant sky blaze until the clouds that still obscure the light are drawn into his brightness and earth is brilliant as the sky is bright spain newly united still divided— as the season of cold is the season of darkness in the spring of our rejoicing that the moor is gone from spain the jew go too but if the spaniard speaks i speak no less a christian throw away the curse you jews of fifteen hundred years stay and prosper and church and heaven prosper in our nets a goodly catch think not that we want aught of you but your souls your money and your jewels— all your trash— keep if you stay and are christian take if you are jews and go we ask of you nothing but your judaism which has brought you so much misery and will bring each of you— the youngest and the gentlest— to the flames of hell and the worm that dies not we give you miserable sinners the waters of paradise we give you the blessings of the saints the blessings of mary the blessed mother of christ and the blessings of our lord jesus isabella there is a sweet reasonableness in the words of our prior it is saint dominic who speaks to us through his dominican or saint james himself abrabanel no noble in your court your majesties proud of his forefather conquering goth or visigoth or vandal is of an older spanish line than we— jews in iberia before the romans came no noble boasting his service boasts of more than that jew who through a thousand shoals and reefs piloted aragon to castile—your marriage and spain ’ s glory the rest of us many tens of thousands serve you humbly in smithy field or vineyard soldiers or physicians as we have served in spain two thousand years spaniards true to your majesties as we are to the god of israel—and of spain unlike the others only in our faith for which if we must answer we shall answer to our god torquemada since all we do and each word spoken if only in our hearts must be in worship— not a leaf falls slowly but in his service— to be unlike us in our faith is to be unlike in everything true you jews must answer to your god and in the flames and burning ice of hell forever you shall answer but we too priests bishops queen and king must answer for you farmer or captain answers shall we be less answerable for souls abrabanel you do not honor your god by bringing him captives like a mere emperor who must have retainers and retinue serfs and forced labor the loadstone without visible motion draws to itself every particle of iron the sword—even though a winged angel swings it— served only to drive adam from his paradise your fingers stiff with rings and jewels you dishonor your faith your majesties by cruelty give it whatever noble name you will as princes make a rogue knight or lord will thieves and pirates be gentler with us than your constables and soldiers — your majesties will hear of many ripped up for the jewels it will be said they swallowed many left by sailors to die on reefs and sandbars for a smock or a pair of hose many dead of plague or found like birds in winter dead in the fields about towns or like fish upon a beach many will die as slaves at work beasts would be fitter for but costlier who have written a page of castilian or handled a toledo blade with the best and yet the weak has each his strength spain of spaniard basque and catalonian moor and gypsy else all beasts were tigers all fish sharks and only giants left the stricken remember— as wounds and scars last longer than the blow— and if drops of water wear channels in the rock on which the earth itself is in the action of centuries how powerful are tears would you have our religion like our clothes—for comfort and the eyes of men put off at night and we left lying naked in the darkness the body is like roots stretching down into the earth— forcing still a way over stones and under rock through sand sucking nourishment in darkness bearing the tread of man and beast and of the earth forever but the spirit— twigs and leaves spreading through sunshine or the luminous darkness of twilight evening night and dawn moving in every wind of heaven and turning to whatever corner of the sky is brightest compelled by nothing stronger than the light the body is like earth the spirit like water without which earth is sand and which must be free or stagnant or if the body is as water the spirit is like air that must have doors and windows or else is stuffy and unbreathable— or like the fire of which sun and stars have been compounded which joshua could command but for an hour isabella if our eye offends us pluck it out even so we will sweep away the jews from every town and hamlet field and corner of our dominion though they are the sands for number go and begone—but stay as christians come and be dear to us as the prodigal abrabanel we jews have been accused of love of wealth but not for all our wealth in spain fields and vineyards houses of timber and houses of stone that we must leave and all the wealth that will be stolen from us will we stay we jews have been accused of arrogance but not for all the dignities that we must leave our offices and honors in this the proudest court of christendom will we stay we jews have been accused of love of life delighting in the flesh but though we shall die along a thousand roads we will not stay— striking roots somewhere to flourish as we flourished giving shade and fruit

there 's a certain slant of light winter afternoons – that oppresses like the heft of cathedral tunes – heavenly hurt it gives us – we can find no scar but internal difference – where the meanings are – none may teach it – any – 'tis the seal despair – an imperial affliction sent us of the air – when it comes the landscape listens – shadows – hold their breath – when it goes 't is like the distance on the look of death –

carpaccio san giorgio degli schiavoni venice you are amazed to find trees in venice — to turn a corner into a campo where two or three rustling acacias spread their halo of leaves over two or three red-slatted benches it ’ s as if you had slipped through a curtained doorway into a hall full of dull gold scenes by carpaccio — a miraculous light — though the rio ’ s still shrouded in a mist compounded of water vapour and smog so it ’ s not that the sun has come out it ’ s something to do with the leaves and painting in the realm of echoes where footsteps reverberate endlessly between two walls and dawn is the chink of a stonemason at his reparations disembodied voices irresistible as bird calls yes you ’ re amazed to find trees in venice shedding their gold leaf onto the pavement outside a secondhand bookstore it ’ s like carpaccio ’ s little white dog wagging his tail at the feet of saint augustine who is staring out of the window looking for the voice of saint jerome

———a simple child that lightly draws its breath and feels its life in every limb what should it know of death i met a little cottage girl she was eight years old she said her hair was thick with many a curl that clustered round her head she had a rustic woodland air and she was wildly clad her eyes were fair and very fair —her beauty made me glad “ sisters and brothers little maid how many may you be ” “ how many seven in all ” she said and wondering looked at me “ and where are they i pray you tell. ” she answered “ seven are we and two of us at conway dwell and two are gone to sea “ two of us in the church-yard lie my sister and my brother and in the church-yard cottage i dwell near them with my mother. ” “ you say that two at conway dwell and two are gone to sea yet ye are seven i pray you tell sweet maid how this may be. ” then did the little maid reply “ seven boys and girls are we two of us in the church-yard lie beneath the church-yard tree. ” “ you run about my little maid your limbs they are alive if two are in the church-yard laid then ye are only five. ” “ their graves are green they may be seen ” the little maid replied “ twelve steps or more from my mother ’ s door and they are side by side “ my stockings there i often knit my kerchief there i hem and there upon the ground i sit and sing a song to them “ and often after sun-set sir when it is light and fair i take my little porringer and eat my supper there “ the first that died was sister jane in bed she moaning lay till god released her of her pain and then she went away “ so in the church-yard she was laid and when the grass was dry together round her grave we played my brother john and i “ and when the ground was white with snow and i could run and slide my brother john was forced to go and he lies by her side. ” “ how many are you then ” said i “ if they two are in heaven ” quick was the little maid ’ s reply “ o master we are seven. ” “ but they are dead those two are dead their spirits are in heaven ” ’ twas throwing words away for still the little maid would have her will and said “ nay we are seven ”

master hirano came from japan together with a priest from the kegon sect and the two of them drank beer all night at the avia hotel next to ben gurion airport the following day when we came to take them to the galilee they had trouble getting up and barely checked out of their rooms on time it was a wintry january morning and near the village of shefaram the priest from the kegon sect asked us to stop and stood by the side of the road and urinated on friday the two of them master hirano and the priest from the kegon sect went to the bratslav hasids ’ synagogue in safed the worshippers swayed like trees in the wind master hirano and the priest from the kegon sect stood there bald and wrapped in robes behind the congregation and the beadle whispered into our ears are they jews are they jews when we left the synagogue master hirano said to the priest from the kegon sect there is no doubt that they understand what devotion he said shujaku is the priest from the kegon sect said there is no doubt they know what devotion is on jerusalem street by the monument of the mortar commemorating the ’ 48 war master hirano said prayer is a good thing the priest from the kegon sect said there is no doubt prayer is a good thing master hirano stood on one side of the mortar and the priest from the kegon sect stood on the other and the moon rose big and full yellow like the fields painted by van gogh it ’ s possible to write only by means of non-writing when things come from the opposite direction my aunt edith rises out of the ground and returns to her bed in the nursing home ursula my stepmother is walking backward all sorts of wilted flowers bring their petals toward themselves all we need is yogurt and a spoon we ’ ll know what to do with the spoon we ’ ll lead it toward the right place which is to say the yogurt and from there toward the mouth but the mouth can ’ t be fathomed likewise the word that stands for it mouth is strange in the extreme or take for example the hand that ’ s holding the spoon with its five tragic fingers there ’ s no logic whatsoever in there being five like five widows who ’ ve gathered because their husbands have died and they allow themselves this movement through the air in order to keep from losing their minds there is no limit to the beauty of things that are sad like old clay vases or a wagon ’ s shaft in a junkyard every year the plum trees flower anew and people whose names are shtiasni or dahaan open doors and close them all these things fill the heart with great joy the beauty of death and the violet colors accompanying it announcements that make nothing dawn on one and the dawn itself rising from nowhere like a birthday present 365 days a year
if i could only get hold of the whole of you how could i ever get hold of the whole of you even more than the most beloved idols more than mountains quarried whole more than mines of burning coal let ’ s say mines of extinguished coal and the breath of day like a fiery furnace if one could get hold of you for all the years how could one get hold of you from all the years how could one lengthen a single arm like a single branch of an african river as one sees in a dream the bay of storms as one sees in a dream a ship that went down the way one imagines a cushion of clouds lily-clouds as the body ’ s cushion but though you will it they will not convey you do not believe that they will convey you if one could get hold of all-of-the-whole-of-you if one could get hold of you like metal say like pillars of copper say like a pillar of purple copper that pillar i remembered last summer — and the bottom of the ocean i have never seen and the bottom of the ocean that i can see with its thousand heavy thickets of air a thousand and one laden breaths if one could only get hold of the-whole-of-you-now how could you ever be for me what i myself am
so many gods they ’ re like books—you can ’ t read everything you never know anything happy the man who knows but one god and keeps him a secret every day i have different beliefs— sometimes in the same day i have different beliefs— and i wish i were the child now crossing the view from my window of the street below he ’ s eating a cheap pastry he ’ s poor without efficient or final cause an animal uselessly raised above the other vertebrates and through his teeth he sings a ribald show tune yes there are many gods but i ’ d give anything to the one who ’ d take that child out of my sight march 9 1930
our annual prairie chanukah party— latkes kugel cherry blintzes friends arrive from nearby towns and dance the twist to “ chanukah lights tonight ” spin like a dreidel to a klezmer hit the candles flicker in the window outside ponderosa pines are tied in red bows if you squint the neighbors ’ christmas lights look like the omaha skyline the smell of oil is in the air we drift off to childhood where we spent our gelt on baseball cards and matinees cream sodas and potato knishes no delis in our neighborhood only the wind howling over the crushed corn stalks inside we try to sweep the darkness out waiting for the messiah to knock wanting to know if he can join the party
at a college in dearborn michigan i read a poem about watching girls at camp hold their breaths under the showers so i could see their breasts swell some people call dearborn a hub of “ terrorist ” activity i ’ ve placed the word terrorist between quotation marks because “ arab ” or “ muslim ” or “ people who look like the terrorists we fear ” is what they mean in the poem about the camp i also use quotation marks around the words “ pussy ” and “ chicken-shit ” but for different reasons — i ’ m waiting in line to jump over a dam into a river where other boys have drowned and i hesitate until someone shouts “ pussy ” and “ chicken-shit ” and you don ’ t need me to tell you what i did what i had to do a famous poet says for a speaker to express authority he must possess three virtues one of which is passion after the reading a young man approached me he turned out to be the younger brother of someone i knew and wrote a poem about a lifeguard who saved a drowning girl the child pulled from the pool could have been a boy — i don ’ t remember it doesn ’ t matter i care about what i ’ m saying — that matters passion is a deep-seated conviction says the famous poet you need to believe that i believe i told the young man in dearborn about his brother saving a life as if he didn ’ t already know he listened politely until i stopped talking and then he said i was out of line and had acted inappropriately how i asked he said i shouldn ’ t use words like that which words i asked he was getting flustered i asked him again i wanted him to say “ pussy ” and “ chicken-shit. ” he said i should not use words like that in front of women by “ women ” he meant arab and muslim women maybe he meant all women i don ’ t know i didn ’ t ask a lot of arabs and muslims live in dearborn that ’ s why some people think of it as a hotbed of islamic terrorism the phrase “ a hotbed of islamic terrorism ” should probably appear between quotes every time people use it even if they are arab or muslim like me the other virtues a speaker should possess says the famous poet are discrimination and inclusiveness by “ discrimination ” he means the speaker should come to his position without ignoring but considering opposed positions and finding them wanting by “ inclusiveness ” he means the speaker immediately sees connections between the subject at hand and other issues also the speaker needs to make the reader believe he is doing his subject justice that he is relating it to the world this makes his voice communal speaking not for any community but with the goal of making communities the first of which is that of speaker and reader the young man speaking on behalf of arab and muslim women told me that my poems were “ indecent ” and “ immoral ” that i should be ashamed that i was a terrible muslim “ go fuck yourself ” is what i wanted to say but — maybe he was right — so i smiled i thanked him for listening and i told him i loved his brother and “ please will you say i said hello ”
under dust plush as a moth ’ s wing the book ’ s leather cover still darkly shone and everywhere else but this spot was sodden beneath the roof ’ s unraveling shingles there was that back-of-the-neck lick of chill and then from my index finger the book opened like a blasted bird in its box of familiar and miraculous inks a construction of filaments and dust thoroughfares of worms and a silage of silverfish husks in the autumn light eight hundred pages of perfect wordless lace

when the most intense revivals swept the mountains just a century ago participants described the shouts and barks in unknown tongues the jerks of those who tried to climb the walls the holy dance and laugh but strangest are reports of what was called the holy cuss sometimes a man who spoke in tongues and leapt for joy would break into an avalanche of cursing that would stun with brilliance and duration those that heard would say the holy spirit spoke as from a whirlwind words burned on the air like chains of dynamite the listeners felt transfigured and felt true contact and true presence then as if the shock of unfamiliar and blasphemous profanity broke through beyond the reach of prayer and song and hallo to answer heaven 's anger with its echo

who wielded the chisel at the left portal south porch the scene of theo chained naked to the waist leaning in to the brutal hand of what looks to be an even younger boy what man carved stone to mimic flesh as it would look inside the torture of its flensing how he must have held the scene in his own mind thought it back to the act itself modeling the lines with his own limbs so he would know both how a body bends in pain and how a hand extends the flayer ’ s rake
they brought it it was brought from the field the last sheaf the last bundle the latest and most final armful up up over the head hold it hold it high it held the gazer ’ s gaze it held hope did hold it through the stubble of september on shoulders aloft hardly anything it weighed like a sparrow it was said something winged hollow though pulsing freed from the field where it flailed in wind where it waited wanted to be found and bound with cord it had limbs it had legs and hands it had fingers fingers and a face peering from the stalks shuttered in the grain closed though just a kernel a shut corm they brought him and autumn rushed in tossed its cape of starlings tattered the frost-spackled field
oh unreadable one why have you done this to your dumb creature why have you chosen to punish the coyote rummaging for chicken bones in the dung heap shucked the fur from his tail and fashioned it into a scabby cane why have you denuded his face tufted it so that when he turns he looks like a slow child unhinging his face in a smile the coyote shambles crow-hops keeps his head low and without fur his now visible pizzle is a sad red protuberance his hind legs the backward image of a bandy-legged grandfather stripped why have you unhoused this wretch from his one aesthetic virtue taken from him that which kept him from burning in the sun like a man why have you pushed him from his world into mine stopped him there and turned his ear toward my warning shout

—katounakia 2007 the cave itself is pleasantly austere with little clutter—nothing save a narrow slab a threadbare woolen wrap and in the chipped-out recess here three sooty icons lit by oil lamp just beyond the dim cave 's aperture a blackened kettle rests among the coals whereby each afternoon a grip of wild greens is boiled to a tender mess the eremite lies prostrate near two books—a gospel and the syrian's collected prose—whose pages turn assisted by a breeze besides the thread of wood smoke rising from the coals no other motion takes the eye the old man 's face is pressed into the earth his body stretched as if to reach ahead the pot boils dry he feeds on what we do not see and may be satisfied

we do n't see the ocean not ever but in july and august when the worst heat seems to rise from the hard clay of this valley you could be walking through a fig orchard when suddenly the wind cools and for a moment you get a whiff of salt and in that moment you can almost believe something is waiting beyond the pacheco pass something massive irrational and so powerful even the mountains that rise east of here have no word for it you probably think i 'm nuts saying the mountains have no word for ocean but if you live here you begin to believe they know everything they maintain that huge silence we think of as divine a silence that grows in autumn when snow falls slowly between the pines and the wind dies to less than a whisper and you can barely catch your breath because you 're thrilled and terrified you have to remember this is n't your land it belongs to no one like the sea you once lived beside and thought was yours remember the small boats that bobbed out as the waves rode in and the men who carved a living from it only to find themselves carved down to nothing now you say this is home so go ahead worship the mountains as they dissolve in dust wait on the wind catch a scent of salt call it our life

all hail to the rev george gilfillan of dundee he is the greatest preacher i did ever hear or see he is a man of genius bright and in him his congregation does delight because they find him to be honest and plain affable in temper and seldom known to complain he preaches in a plain straightforward way the people flock to hear him night and day and hundreds from the doors are often turn ’ d away because he is the greatest preacher of the present day he has written the life of sir walter scott and while he lives he will never be forgot nor when he is dead because by his admirers it will be often read and fill their minds with wonder and delight and wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter ’ s night he has also written about the bards of the bible which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main and to get an interview with him it would be almost vain and in that he is always right for the bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do do it with all your might rev george gilfillan of dundee i must conclude my muse and to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly that when you are dead they shall not look upon your like again

sunday september sunday ... outdoors like an early page from the appalachian book of the dead sunlight lavishes brilliance on every surface doves settle surreptitious angels on tree limb and box branch a crow calls deep in its own darkness something like water ticks on just there beyond the horizon just there steady clock ... go in fear of abstractions ... well possibly meanwhile they are the strata our bodies rise through the sere veins our skins rub off on for instance whatever enlightenment there might be housels compassion and affection those two tributaries that river above our lives whose waters we sense the sense of late at night and later still uneasy suburbanized i drift from the lawn chair to the back porch to the dwarf orchard testing the grass and border garden a stillness as in the passageways of paradise bell jars the afternoon leaves like ex votos hang hard and shine under the endlessness of heaven such skeletal altars such vacant sanctuary it always amazes me how landscape recalibrates the stations of the dead how what we see jacks up the odd quotient of what we don ’ t see how god ’ s breath reconstitutes our walking up and walking down first glimpse of autumn stretched tight and snicked a bad face lift flicks in and flicks out a virtual reality time to begin the long division
as i one evening sat before my cell methought a star did shoot into my lap i rose and shook my clothes as knowing well that from small fires comes oft no small mishap when suddenly i heard one say “ do as thou usest disobey expel good motions from thy breast which have the face of fire but end in rest. ” i who had heard of music in the spheres but not of speech in stars began to muse but turning to my god whose ministers the stars and all things are “ if i refuse dread lord ” said i “ so oft my good then i refuse not ev ’ n with blood to wash away my stubborn thought for i will do or suffer what i ought “ but i have also stars and shooters too born where thy servants both artilleries use my tears and prayers night and day do woo and work up to thee yet thou dost refuse not but i am i must say still much more obliged to do thy will than thou to grant mine but because thy promise now hath ev ’ n set thee thy laws “ then we are shooters both and thou dost deign to enter combat with us and contest with thine own clay but i would parley fain shun not my arrows and behold my breast yet if thou shunnest i am thine i must be so if i am mine there is no articling with thee i am but finite yet thine infinitely ”

a full year passed the seasons keep me honest since i last noticed this same commotion who knew god was an abstract expressionist i ’ m asking myself—the very question i asked last year staring out at this array of racing colors then set in motion by the chance invasion of a steller ’ s jay is this what people mean by speed of light my usually levelheaded mulberry tree hurling arrows everywhere in sight— its bow the out-of-control virginia creeper my friends say i should do something about whose vermilion went at least a full shade deeper at the provocation of the upstart blue the leaves half green half gold suddenly hyper in savage competition with that red and blue— tohubohu returned in living color kandinsky where were you when i needed you my attempted poem would lie fallow a year i was so busy focusing on the desert ’ s stinginess with everything but rumor no place even for the spectrum ’ s introverts— rose olive gray—no pigment at all— and certainly no room for shameless braggarts like the ones that barge in here every fall and make me feel like an unredeemed failure even more emphatically than usual and here they are again their fleet allure still more urgent this time—the desert ’ s gone i ’ m through with it want something fuller— why shouldn ’ t a person have a little fun some utterly unnecessary extravagance which was—at least i think it was—god ’ s plan when he set up such things are never left to chance that one split-second assignation with genuine no-kidding-around omnipotence what for lack of better words i ’ m calling vision you breathe in and for once there ’ s something there just when you thought you ’ d learned some resignation there ’ s real resistance in the nearby air until the entire universe is swayed even that desert of yours isn ’ t quite so bare and god ’ s not nonexistent he ’ s just been waylaid by a host of what no one could ’ ve foreseen he ’ s got plans for you this red-gold-green parade is actually a fairly detailed outline david never needed one but he ’ s long dead and god could use a little recognition he promises it won ’ t go to his head and if you praise him properly an autumn psalm why didn ’ t i think of that you ’ ll have it made but while it ’ s true that my virginia creeper praises him its palms and fingers crimson with applause that the local breeze is weaving him a diadem inspecting my tree ’ s uncut gold for flaws i came to talk about the way that violet-blue sprang the greens and reds and yellows into action actual motion i swear it ’ s true though i ’ m not sure i ever took it in now i ’ d be prepared if some magician flew into my field of vision to realign that dazzle out my window yet again it ’ s not likely but i ’ m keeping my eyes open though i still wouldn ’ t be able to explain precisely what happened to these vines these trees it isn ’ t available in my tradition for this i would have to be chinese wang wei to be precise on a mountain autumn rain converging on the trees a cassia flower nearby a cloud a pine washerwomen heading home for the day my senses and the mountain so entirely in tune that when my stroke of blue arrives i ’ m ready though there is no rain here the air ’ s shot through with gold on golden leaves wang wei ’ s so giddy he ’ s calling back the dead li bai du fu guys you ’ ve got to see this—autumn sun they ’ re suddenly hell-bent on learning hebrew in order to get inside the celebration which explains how they wound up where they are in my university library ’ s squashed domain poor guys it was hebrew they were looking for but they ended up across the aisle from yiddish— some library of congress cataloger ’ s sense of humor the world ’ s calmest characters and its most skittish squinting at each other head to head all silently intoning some version of kaddish for their nonexistent readers one side ’ s dead the twentieth century ’ s lasting contribution and the other ’ s insufficiently learned to understand a fraction of what they mean the writings in the world ’ s most spoken language across from one that can barely get a minyan sick of lanzmen the yidden are trying to engage the guys across the aisle in some conversation how for example do you squeeze an image into so few words respectfully asks glatstein wang wei at first doesn ’ t understand the problem but then he shrugs his shoulders mumbles zen ... but please i myself overheard a poem in the autumn rain once on a mountain how do you do it i believe it ’ s called a psalm glatstein ’ s cronies all crack up in unison okay groise macher give him an answer but glatstein dons his yarmulke who knew he had one and starts the introduction to the morning prayer pisukei di zimrah psalm by psalm wang wei is spellbound the stacks ’ stale air suddenly a veritable balm and i ’ m so touched by these amazing goings-on that i ’ ve forgotten all about the autumn staring straight at me still alive still golden what ’ s gold anyway compared to poetry a trick of chlorophyll a trick of sun true it was something my changing tree with its perfect complement a crimson vine both thrown into panic by a steller ’ s jay but it ’ s hard to shake the habit of digression wandering has always been my people ’ s way whether we ’ re in a desert or narration it ’ s too late to emulate wang wei and his solitary years on that one mountain though i ’ d love to say what i set out to say just once next autumn maybe what ’ s the occasion glatstein will shout over to me from the bookcase that is if he ’ s paying any attention and finally i ’ ll look him in the face quick out the window yankev it ’ s here again
what say the bells of san blas to the ships that southward pass from the harbor of mazatlan to them it is nothing more than the sound of surf on the shore — nothing more to master or man but to me a dreamer of dreams to whom what is and what seems are often one and the same — the bells of san blas to me have a strange wild melody and are something more than a name for bells are the voice of the church they have tones that touch and search the hearts of young and old one sound to all yet each lends a meaning to their speech and the meaning is manifold they are a voice of the past of an age that is fading fast of a power austere and grand when the flag of spain unfurled its folds o'er this western world and the priest was lord of the land the chapel that once looked down on the little seaport town has crumbled into the dust and on oaken beams below the bells swing to and fro and are green with mould and rust `` is then the old faith dead '' they say `` and in its stead is some new faith proclaimed that we are forced to remain naked to sun and rain unsheltered and ashamed `` once in our tower aloof we rang over wall and roof our warnings and our complaints and round about us there the white doves filled the air like the white souls of the saints `` the saints ah have they grown forgetful of their own are they asleep or dead that open to the sky their ruined missions lie no longer tenanted `` oh bring us back once more the vanished days of yore when the world with faith was filled bring back the fervid zeal the hearts of fire and steel the hands that believe and build `` then from our tower again we will send over land and main our voices of command like exiled kings who return to their thrones and the people learn that the priest is lord of the land '' o bells of san blas in vain ye call back the past again the past is deaf to your prayer out of the shadows of night the world rolls into light it is daybreak everywhere

you could drive blind for those two seconds and they would be forever i think that as a diesel truck passes us eight miles east of mission churning through the storm heedless of the hill sliding away there isn ’ t much use to curse but i do words fly away tumbling invisibly toward the unseen point where the prairie and sky meet the road is like that in those seconds nothing but the blind white side of creation you ’ re there somewhere a tiny struggling cell you just might be significant but you might not be anything forever is a space of split time from which to recover after the mass passes my curse flies out there somewhere and then i send my prayer into the wake of the diesel truck headed for sioux falls one hundred and eighty miles through the storm
i. isaiah awoke angry lapping at isaiah ’ s ears black birdsong no it was anger god had filled isaiah ’ s ears with stingers once god and isaiah were friends god and isaiah used to converse nightly isaiah would rush into the garden they conversed under the branch night streamed down from the sole of the foot to the head god would make isaiah ring isaiah had loved god and now his love was turned to pain isaiah wanted a name for the pain he called it sin now isaiah was a man who believed he was a nation isaiah called the nation judah and the sin judah ’ s condition inside isaiah god saw the worldsheet burning isaiah and god saw things differently i can only tell you their actions isaiah addressed the nation man ’ s brittleness cried isaiah the nation stirred in its husk and slept again two slabs of bloody meat lay folded on its eyes like wings like a hard glossy painting the nation slept who can invent a new fear yet i have invented sin thought isaiah running his hand over the knobs and then because of a great attraction between them— which isaiah fought for and against for the rest of his life— god shattered isaiah ’ s indifference god washed isaiah ’ s hair in fire god took the stay from beneath its meat wings the nation listened you said isaiah no answer i can not hear you isaiah spoke again under the branch light bleached open the night camera god arrived god smashed isaiah like glass through every socket of his nation liar said god isaiah put his hands on his coat he put his hand on his face isaiah is a small man said isaiah but no liar god paused and so that was their contract brittle on both sides no lying isaiah ’ s wife came to the doorway the doorposts had moved what ’ s that sound said isaiah ’ s wife the fear of the lord said isaiah he grinned in the dark she went back inside
for alix walcott i between the vision of the tourist board and the true paradise lies the desert where isaiah ’ s elations force a rose from the sand the thirty-third canto cores the dawn clouds with concentric radiance the breadfruit opens its palms in praise of the bounty bois-pain tree of bread slave food the bliss of john clare torn wandering tom stoat-stroker in his county of reeds and stalk-crickets fiddling the dank air lacing his boots with vines steering glazed beetles with the tenderest prods knight of the cockchafer wrapped in the mists of shires their snail-horned steeples palms opening to the cupped pool—but his soul safer than ours though iron streams fetter his ankles frost whitening his stubble he stands in the ford of a brook like the baptist lifting his branches to bless cathedrals and snails the breaking of this new day and the shadows of the beach road near which my mother lies with the traffic of insects going to work anyway the lizard on the white wall fixed on the hieroglyph of its stone shadow the palms ’ rustling archery the souls and sails of circling gulls rhyme with “ in la sua volont è nostra pace ” in his will is our peace peace in white harbours in marinas whose masts agree in crescent melons left all night in the fridge in the egyptian labours of ants moving boulders of sugar words in this sentence shadow and light who live next door like neighbours and in sardines with pepper sauce my mother lies near the white beach stones john clare near the sea-almonds yet the bounty returns each daybreak to my surprise to my surprise and betrayal yes both at once i am moved like you mad tom by a line of ants i behold their industry and they are giants ii there on the beach in the desert lies the dark well where the rose of my life was lowered near the shaken plants near a pool of fresh tears tolled by the golden bell of allamanda thorns of the bougainvillea and that is their bounty they shine with defiance from weed and flower even those that flourish elsewhere vetch ivy clematis on whom the sun now rises with all its power not for the tourist board or for dante alighieri but because there is no other path for its wheel to take except to make the ruts of the beach road an allegory of this poem ’ s career of yours that she died for the sake of a crowning wreath of false laurel so john clare forgive me for this morning ’ s sake forgive me coffee and pardon me milk with two packets of artificial sugar as i watch these lines grow and the art of poetry harden me into sorrow as measured as this to draw the veiled figure of mamma entering the standard elegiac no there is grief there will always be but it must not madden like clare who wept for a beetle ’ s loss for the weight of the world in a bead of dew on clematis or vetch and the fire in these tinder-dry lines of this poem i hate as much as i love her poor rain-beaten wretch redeemer of mice earl of the doomed protectorate of cavalry under your cloak come on now enough iii bounty in the bells of tree-frogs with their steady clamour in the indigo dark before dawn the fading morse of fireflies and crickets then light on the beetle ’ s armour and the toad ’ s too-late presages nettles of remorse that shall spring from her grave from the spade ’ s heartbreak and yet not to have loved her enough is to love more if i confess it and i confess it the trickle of underground springs the babble of swollen gulches under drenched ferns loosening the grip of their roots till their hairy clods like unclenching fists swirl wherever the gulch turns them and the shuddering aftermath bends the rods of wild cane bounty in the ant ’ s waking fury in the snail ’ s chapel stirring under wild yams praise in decay and process awe in the ordinary in wind that reads the lines of the breadfruit ’ s palms in the sun contained in a globe of the crystal dew bounty in the ants ’ continuing a line of raw flour mercy on the mongoose scuttling past my door in the light ’ s parallelogram laid on the kitchen floor for thine is the kingdom the glory and the power the bells of saint clement ’ s in the marigolds on the altar in the bougainvillea ’ s thorns in the imperial lilac and the feathery palms that nodded at the entry into jerusalem the weight of the world on the back of an ass dismounting he left his cross there for sentry and sneering centurion then i believed in his word in a widow ’ s immaculate husband in pews of brown wood when the cattle-bell of the chapel summoned our herd into the varnished stalls in whose rustling hymnals i heard the fresh jacobean springs the murmur clare heard of bounty abiding the clear language she taught us “ as the hart panteth ” at this her keen ears pronged while her three fawns nibbled the soul-freshening waters “ as the hart panteth for the water-brooks ” that belonged to the language in which i mourn her now or when i showed her my first elegy her husband ’ s and then her own iv but can she or can she not read this can you read this mamma or hear it if i took the pulpit lay-preacher like tender clare like poor tom so that look miss the ants come to you like children their beloved teacher alix but unlike the silent recitation of the infants the choir that clare and tom heard in their rainy county we have no solace but utterance hence this wild cry snails move into harbour the breadfruit plants on the bounty will be heaved aboard and the white god is captain bligh across white feathery grave-grass the shadow of the soul passes the canvas cracks open on the cross-trees of the bounty and the trades lift the shrouds of the resurrected sail all move in their passage to the same mother-country the dirt-clawing weasel the blank owl or sunning seal faith grows mutinous the ribbed body with its cargo stalls in its doldrums the god-captain is cast adrift by a mutinous christian in the wake of the turning argo plants bob in the ocean ’ s furrows their shoots dip and lift and the soul ’ s australia is like the new testament after the old world the code of an eye for an eye the horizon spins slowly and authority ’ s argument diminishes in power in the longboat with captain bligh this was one of your earliest lessons how the christ-son questions the father to settle on another island haunted by him by the speck of a raging deity on the ruled horizon diminishing in meaning and distance growing more dim all these predictable passages that we first disobey before we become what we challenged but you never altered your voice either sighing or sewing you would pray to your husband aloud pedalling the hymns we all heard in the varnished pew “ there is a green hill far away ” “ jerusalem the golden. ” your melody faltered but never your faith in the bounty which is his word v all of these waves crepitate from the culture of ovid its sibilants and consonants a universal metre piles up these signatures like inscriptions of seaweed that dry in the pungent sun lines ruled by mitre and laurel or spray swiftly garlanding the forehead of an outcrop and i hope this settles the matter of presences no soul was ever invented yet every presence is transparent if i met her in her nightdress ankling barefoot crooning to the shallows should i call her shadow that of a pattern invented by graeco-roman design columns of shadows cast by the forum augustan perspectives— poplars casuarina-colonnades the in-and-out light of almonds made from original latin no leaf but the olive ’ s questions of pitch faced with seraphic radiance don ’ t interrupt mortals rub their skeptical eyes that hell is a beach-fire at night where embers dance with temporal fireflies like thoughts of paradise but there are inexplicable instincts that keep recurring not from hope or fear only that are real as stones the faces of the dead we wait for as ants are transferring their cities though we no longer believe in the shining ones i half-expect to see you no longer then more than half almost never or never then—there i have said it— but felt something less than final at the edge of your grave some other something somewhere equally dreaded since the fear of the infinite is the same as death unendurable brightness the substantial dreading its own substance dissolving to gases and vapours like our dread of distance we need a horizon a dividing line that turns the stars into neighbours though infinity separates them we can think of only one sun all i am saying is that the dread of death is in the faces we love the dread of our dying or theirs therefore we see in the glint of immeasurable spaces not stars or falling embers not meteors but tears vi the mango trees serenely rust when they are in flower nobody knows the name for that voluble cedar whose bell-flowers fall the pomme-arac purples its floor the blue hills in late afternoon always look sadder the country night waiting to come in outside the door the firefly keeps striking matches and the hillside fumes with a bluish signal of charcoal then the smoke burns into a larger question one that forms and unforms then loses itself in a cloud till the question returns buckets clatter under pipes villages begin at corners a man and his trotting dog come back from their garden the sea blazes beyond the rust roofs dark is on us before we know it the earth smells of what ’ s done small yards brighten day dies and its mourners begin the first wreath of gnats this was when we sat down on bright verandahs watching the hills die nothing is trite once the beloved have vanished empty clothes in a row but perhaps our sadness tires them who cherished delight not only are they relieved of our customary sorrow they are without hunger without any appetite but are part of earth ’ s vegetal fury their veins grow with the wild mammy-apple the open-handed breadfruit their heart in the open pomegranate in the sliced avocado ground-doves pick from their palms ants carry the freight of their sweetness their absence in all that we eat their savour that sweetens all of our multiple juices their faith that we break and chew in a wedge of cassava and here at first is the astonishment that earth rejoices in the middle of our agony earth that will have her for good wind shines white stones and the shallows ’ voices vii in spring after the bear ’ s self-burial the stuttering crocuses open and choir glaciers shelve and thaw frozen ponds crack into maps green lances spring from the melting fields flags of rooks rise and tatter the pierced light the crumbling quiet avalanches of an unsteady sky the vole uncoils and the otter worries his sleek head through the verge ’ s branches crannies culverts and creeks roar with wrist-numbing water deer vault invisible hurdles and sniff the sharp air squirrels spring up like questions berries easily redden edges delight in their own shapes whoever their shaper but here there is one season our viridian eden is that of the primal garden that engendered decay from the seed of a beetle ’ s shard or a dead hare white and forgotten as winter with spring on its way there is no change now no cycles of spring autumn winter nor an island ’ s perpetual summer she took time with her no climate no calendar except for this bountiful day as poor tom fed his last crust to trembling birds as by reeds and cold pools john clare blest these thin musicians let the ants teach me again with the long lines of words my business and duty the lesson you taught your sons to write of the light ’ s bounty on familiar things that stand on the verge of translating themselves into news the crab the frigate that floats on cruciform wings and that nailed and thorn riddled tree that opens its pews to the blackbird that hasn ’ t forgotten her because it sings
impatient as we were for all of them to join us the land had not yet risen into view gulls had swept the gray steel towers away so that it profited less to go searching away over the humming earth than to stay in immediate relation to these other things—boxes store parts whatever you wanted to call them— whose installedness was the price of further revolutions so you knew this combat was the last and still the relationship waxed billowed like scenery on the breeze they are the same aren ’ t they the presumed landscape and the dream of home because the people are all homesick today or desperately sleeping trying to remember how those rectangular shapes became so extraneous and so near to create a foreground of quiet knowledge in which youth had grown old chanting and singing wise hymns that will sign for old age and so lift up the past to be persuaded and be put down again the warning is nothing more than an aspirate “ h ” the problem is sketched completely like fireworks mounted on poles complexion of evening the accurate voices of the others during coca-cola lessons it becomes patent of noise on the left and we had so skipped a stage that the great wave of the past compounded in derision submerged idea and non-dreamer alike in falsetto starlight like “ purity ” of design that had been the first danger sign to wash the sticky icky stuff down the drain—pfui how does it feel to be outside and inside at the same time the delicious feeling of the air contradicting and secretly abetting the interior warmth but the land curdles the dismay in which it ’ s written bearing to a final point of folly and doom the wisdom of these generations look at what you ’ ve done to the landscape— the ice cube the olive— there is a perfect tri-city mesh of things extending all the way along the river on both sides with the end left for thoughts on construction that are always turning to alps and thresholds above the tide of others feeding a european moss rose without glory we shall very soon have the pleasure of recording a period of unanimous tergiversation in this respect and to make that pleasure the greater it is worth while at the risk of tedious iteration to put first upon record a final protest rather decaying art genius inspiration to hold to an impossible “ calque ” of reality than “ the new school of the trivial rising up on the field of battle something of sludge and leaf-mold ” and life goes trickling out through the holes like water through a sieve all in one direction you who were directionless and thought it would solve everything if you found one what do you make of this just because a thing is immortal is that any reason to worship it death after all is immortal but you have gone into your houses and shut the doors meaning there can be no further discussion and the river pursues its lonely course with the sky and the trees cast up from the landscape for green brings unhappiness—le vert porte malheur “ the chartreuse mountain on the absinthe plain makes the strong man ’ s tears tumble down like rain. ” all this came to pass eons ago your program worked out perfectly you even avoided the monotony of perfection by leaving in certain flaws a backward way of becoming a forced handshake an absent-minded smile though in fact nothing was left to chance each detail was startlingly clear as though seen through a magnifying glass or would have been to an ideal observer namely yourself— for only you could watch yourself so patiently from afar the way god watches a sinner on the path to redemption sometimes disappearing into valleys but always on the way for it all builds up into something meaningless or meaningful as architecture because planned and then abandoned when completed to live afterwards in sunlight and shadow a certain amount of years who cares about what was there before there is no going back for standing still means death and life is moving on moving on towards death but sometimes standing still is also life
as i in hoary winter ’ s night stood shivering in the snow surpris ’ d i was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow and lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near a pretty babe all burning bright did in the air appear who scorched with excessive heat such floods of tears did shed as though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed “ alas ” quoth he “ but newly born in fiery heats i fry yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but i my faultless breast the furnace is the fuel wounding thorns love is the fire and sighs the smoke the ashes shame and scorns the fuel justice layeth on and mercy blows the coals the metal in this furnace wrought are men ’ s defiled souls for which as now on fire i am to work them to their good so will i melt into a bath to wash them in my blood. ” with this he vanish ’ d out of sight and swiftly shrunk away and straight i called unto mind that it was christmas day
the world ’ s light shines shine as it will the world will love its darkness still i doubt though when the world ’ s in hell it will not love its darkness half so well
little poems in prose i. the exodus august 3 1492 1. the spanish noon is a blaze of azure fire and the dusty pilgrims crawl like an endless serpent along treeless plains and bleached highroads through rock-split ravines and castellated cathedral-shadowed towns 2. the hoary patriarch wrinkled as an almond shell bows painfully upon his staff the beautiful young mother ivory-pale well-nigh swoons beneath her burden in her large enfolding arms nestles her sleeping babe round her knees flock her little ones with bruised and bleeding feet “ mother shall we soon be there ” 3. the youth with christ-like countenance speaks comfortably to father and brother to maiden and wife in his breast his own heart is broken 4. the halt the blind are amid the train sturdy pack-horses laboriously drag the tented wagons wherein lie the sick athirst with fever 5. the panting mules are urged forward with spur and goad stuffed are the heavy saddlebags with the wreckage of ruined homes 6. hark to the tinkling silver bells that adorn the tenderly-carried silken scrolls 7. in the fierce noon-glare a lad bears a kindled lamp behind its network of bronze the airs of heaven breathe not upon its faint purple star 8. noble and abject learned and simple illustrious and obscure plod side by side all brothers now all merged in one routed army of misfortune 9. woe to the straggler who falls by the wayside no friend shall close his eyes 10. they leave behind the grape the olive and the fig the vines they planted the corn they sowed the garden-cities of andalusia and aragon estremadura and la mancha of granada and castile the altar the hearth and the grave of their fathers 11. the townsman spits at their garments the shepherd quits his flock the peasant his plow to pelt with curses and stones the villager sets on their trail his yelping cur 12. oh the weary march oh the uptorn roots of home oh the blankness of the receding goal 13. listen to their lamentation they that ate dainty food are desolate in the streets they that were reared in scarlet embrace dunghills they flee away and wander about men say among the nations they shall no more sojourn there our end is near our days are full our doom is come 14. whither shall they turn for the west hath cast them out and the east refuseth to receive 15. o bird of the air whisper to the despairing exiles that to-day to-day from the many-masted gayly-bannered port of palos sails the world-unveiling genoese to unlock the golden gates of sunset and bequeath a continent to freedom ii treasures 1. through cycles of darkness the diamond sleeps in its coal-black prison 2. purely incrusted in its scaly casket the breath-tarnished pearl slumbers in mud and ooze 3. buried in the bowels of earth rugged and obscure lies the ingot of gold 4. long hast thou been buried o israel in the bowels of earth long hast thou slumbered beneath the overwhelming waves long hast thou slept in the rayless house of darkness 5. rejoice and sing for only thus couldst thou rightly guard the golden knowledge truth the delicate pearl and the adamantine jewel of the law iii the sower 1. over a boundless plain went a man carrying seed 2. his face was blackened by sun and rugged from tempest scarred and distorted by pain naked to the loins his back was ridged with furrows his breast was plowed with stripes 3. from his hand dropped the fecund seed 4. and behold instantly started from the prepared soil blade a sheaf a springing trunk a myriad-branching cloud-aspiring tree its arms touched the ends of the horizon the heavens were darkened with its shadow 5. it bare blossoms of gold and blossoms of blood fruitage of health and fruitage of poison birds sang amid its foliage and a serpent was coiled about its stem 6. under its branches a divinely beautiful man crowned with thorns was nailed to a cross 7. and the tree put forth treacherous boughs to strangle the sower his flesh was bruised and torn but cunningly he disentangled the murderous knot and passed to the eastward 8. again there dropped from his hand the fecund seed 9. and behold instantly started from the prepared soil a blade a sheaf a springing trunk a myriad-branching cloud-aspiring tree crescent shaped like little emerald moons were the leaves it bare blossoms of silver and blossoms of blood fruitage of health and fruitage of poison birds sang amid its foilage and a serpent was coiled about its stem 10. under its branches a turbaned mighty-limbed prophet brandished a drawn sword 11. and behold this tree likewise puts forth perfidious arms to strangle the sower but cunningly he disentangles the murderous knot and passes on 12. lo his hands are not empty of grain the strength of his arm is not spent 13. what germ hast thou saved for the future o miraculous husbandman tell me thou planter of christhood and islam tell me thou seed-bearing israel iv the test 1. daylong i brooded upon the passion of israel 2. i saw him bound to the wheel nailed to the cross cut off by the sword burned at the stake tossed into the seas 3. and always the patient resolute martyr face arose in silent rebuke and defiance 4. a prophet with four eyes wide gazed the orbs of the spirit above the sleeping eyelids of the senses 5. a poet who plucked from his bosom the quivering heart and fashioned it into a lyre 6. a placid-browed sage uplifted from earth in celestial meditation 7. these i saw with princes and people in their train the monumental dead and the standard-bearers of the future 8. and suddenly i heard a burst of mocking laughter and turning i beheld the shuffling gait the ignominious features the sordid mask of the son of the ghetto v. currents 1. vast oceanic movements the flux and reflux of immeasurable tides oversweep our continent 2. from the far caucasian steppes from the squalid ghettos of europe 3. from odessa and bucharest from kief and ekaterinoslav 4. hark to the cry of the exiles of babylon the voice of rachel mourning for her children of israel lamenting for zion 5. and lo like a turbid stream the long-pent flood bursts the dykes of oppression and rushes hitherward 6. unto her ample breast the generous mother of nations welcomes them 7. the herdsman of canaan and the seed of jerusalem ’ s royal shepherds renew their youth amid the pastoral plains of texas and the golden valleys of the sierras vi the prophet 1. moses ben maimon lifting his perpetual lamp over the path of the perplexed 2. hallevi the honey-tongued poet wakening amid the silent ruins of zion the sleeping lyre of david 3. moses the wise son of mendel who made the ghetto illustrious 4. abarbanel the counselor of kings aicharisi the exquisite singer ibn ezra the perfect old man gabirol the tragic seer 5. heine the enchanted magician the heart-broken jester 6.yea and the century-crowned patriarch whose bounty engirdles the globe — 7. these need no wreath and no trumpet like perennial asphodel blossoms their fame their glory resounds like the brazen-throated cornet 8. but thou—hast thou faith in the fortune of israel wouldst thou lighten the anguish of jacob 9. then shalt thou take the hand of yonder caftaned wretch with flowing curls and gold-pierced ears 10. who crawls blinking forth from the loathsome recesses of the jewry 11. nerveless his fingers puny his frame haunted by the bat-like phantoms of superstition is his brain 12. thou shalt say to the bigot “ my brother ” and to the creature of darkness “ my friend. ” 13 and thy heart shall spend itself in fountains of love upon the ignorant the coarse and the abject 14. then in the obscurity thou shalt hear a rush of wings thine eyes shall be bitten with pungent smoke 15. and close against thy quivering lips shall be pressed the live coal wherewith the seraphim brand the prophets vii chrysalis 1. long long has the orient jew spun around his helplessness the cunningly enmeshed web of talmud and kabbala 2. imprisoned in dark corners of misery and oppression closely he drew about him the dust-gray filaments soft as silk and stubborn as steel until he lay death-stiffened in mummied seclusion 3. and the world has named him an ugly worm shunning the blessed daylight 4. but when the emancipating springtide breathes wholesome quickening airs when the sun of love shines out with cordial fires lo the soul of israel bursts her cobweb sheath and flies forth attired in the winged beauty of immortality

that night your great guns unawares shook all our coffins as we lay and broke the chancel window-squares we thought it was the judgment-day and sat upright while drearisome arose the howl of wakened hounds the mouse let fall the altar-crumb the worms drew back into the mounds the glebe cow drooled till god called “ no it ’ s gunnery practice out at sea just as before you went below the world is as it used to be “ all nations striving strong to make red war yet redder mad as hatters they do no more for christés sake than you who are helpless in such matters “ that this is not the judgment-hour for some of them ’ s a blessed thing for if it were they ’ d have to scour hell ’ s floor for so much threatening ... “ ha ha it will be warmer when i blow the trumpet if indeed i ever do for you are men and rest eternal sorely need ” so down we lay again “ i wonder will the world ever saner be ” said one “ than when he sent us under in our indifferent century ” and many a skeleton shook his head “ instead of preaching forty year ” my neighbour parson thirdly said “ i wish i had stuck to pipes and beer. ” again the guns disturbed the hour roaring their readiness to avenge as far inland as stourton tower and camelot and starlit stonehenge
for some people the day comes when they have to declare the great yes or the great no it ’ s clear at once who has the yes ready within him and saying it he goes from honor to honor strong in his conviction he who refuses does not repent asked again he ’ d still say no yet that no—the right no— drags him down all his life
from mustapha o wearisome condition of humanity born under one law to another bound vainly begot and yet forbidden vanity created sick commanded to be sound what meaneth nature by these diverse laws passion and reason self-division cause is it the mark or majesty of power to make offenses that it may forgive nature herself doth her own self deflower to hate those errors she herself doth give for how should man think that he may not do if nature did not fail and punish too tyrant to others to herself unjust only commands things difficult and hard forbids us all things which it knows is lust makes easy pains unpossible reward if nature did not take delight in blood she would have made more easy ways to good we that are bound by vows and by promotion with pomp of holy sacrifice and rites to teach belief in good and still devotion to preach of heaven ’ s wonders and delights yet when each of us in his own heart looks he finds the god there far unlike his books
awake glad heart get up and sing it is the birth-day of thy king awake awake the sun doth shake light from his locks and all the way breathing perfumes doth spice the day awake awake hark how th ’ wood rings winds whisper and the busy springs a concert make awake awake man is their high-priest and should rise to offer up the sacrifice i would i were some bird or star flutt ’ ring in woods or lifted far above this inn and road of sin then either star or bird should be shining or singing still to thee i would i had in my best part fit rooms for thee or that my heart were so clean as thy manger was but i am all filth and obscene yet if thou wilt thou canst make clean sweet jesu will then let no more this leper haunt and soil thy door cure him ease him o release him and let once more by mystic birth the lord of life be born in earth
after one moment when i bowed my head and the whole world turned over and came upright and i came out where the old road shone white i walked the ways and heard what all men said forests of tongues like autumn leaves unshed being not unlovable but strange and light old riddles and new creeds not in despite but softly as men smile about the dead the sages have a hundred maps to give that trace their crawling cosmos like a tree they rattle reason out through many a sieve that stores the sand and lets the gold go free and all these things are less than dust to me because my name is lazarus and i live
when for the thorns with which i long too long with many a piercing wound my saviour ’ s head have crowned i seek with garlands to redress that wrong through every garden every mead i gather flowers my fruits are only flowers dismantling all the fragrant towers that once adorned my shepherdess ’ s head and now when i have summed up all my store thinking so i myself deceive so rich a chaplet thence to weave as never yet the king of glory wore alas i find the serpent old that twining in his speckled breast about the flowers disguised does fold with wreaths of fame and interest ah foolish man that wouldst debase with them and mortal glory heaven ’ s diadem but thou who only couldst the serpent tame either his slippery knots at once untie and disentangle all his winding snare or shatter too with him my curious frame and let these wither so that he may die though set with skill and chosen out with care that they while thou on both their spoils dost tread may crown thy feet that could not crown thy head
whom should i consult philosophers are happy in their homes and seminars see this one with the mischievous bright childlike gaze going out through walls and air a tangent to the bent rays of the star hear the chalk splutter hear the groping voice conceive the demiurge in his perpetual strife with the chaos of the universe that humming equilibrium of creation pure and enormous crossed by the constant light of unimaginable combustion teems how it teems an elm tree sighs beyond the dusty windowledge of june as in the mind the notes of a melody vibrate when vibration ’ s gone a series generated by a decimal has no end observe it closely though it stops when it stops the frail spectacles are bedimmed with spring but whom should i consult well-seasoned men ruddy with business or the salty summer autumnal in their woolens gaze toward the quick plumes above the city a frosty morning sun reddens the river this one is meditative and well-qualified decently shined one heavy saddle-dark perforated brogan swings from the swivel chair arm leaning back the head well-cropped and grey the experienced eyes quiet with one highlighted pupil a reader of herodotus in the evening the road was in receivership the mills were in receivership the bondholders suitably informed would not dissent from an able plan of reorganization easy did it and his beautiful daughters sink in a circle of white skirts like daisies laughing for the brash photographer years ago they sailed to the north cape made out that flecked mass in the east with mother and the broad-shouldered boy from cook ’ s on deck in the dim summer on the grey sea often they saw the fishermen off cherbourg in the awe of morning hitting the outside spanking seas red sails in sea-light far away in the nursery a music box plucks its icy bavarian tune for them then whom a thousand flashes from long island enter the high room in the office building a heliograph of cars turning toward sunset will he decipher them the journalist sweats in his shirtsleeves mutilates cigarettes in a smouldering tray surveys me and the world in a racket of teletypes sick of it and excited needing a drink positive copy sprouts from the typewriter each paragraph a piston stroke the sun glitters on hackensack sorrows on the land goes out like a pliant egg sucked down a bottle under the shadowing azure a violet dusk consumes the sharp walls of the world the melancholy distributor of wit snatches at straws amid the alien darkness a whirl of dusty danger for his retreat the priest lifts up the monstrance muttering abstracted latin to the tinkle behind him presently they will bawl the stabat mater and all those years at seminary reading st. basil and jerome girding his cassock for handball in the gritty cement courtyard under the swooping smoke of the powerhouse and ordination when the folks from chicago wept before the bishop mortify the flesh think on thy last end pray the holy mother of god in her infinite mercy and him who rests in the dark chapel always where the wick burns in wax a cuddling flame deduced by thomas from the tip of heaven or should i tumble to the recumbent confessional and the scientist of distress for any child the terror in the night the hating eyes by day may be death ’ s cunning orchestration they prepare the servant ’ s cry at last absolute and lonely see this easy gentleman in tweeds deepchested a swimmer to the farthest light diagnostician of the subaqueous faces of dreams with patience like a lover he must all day sustain his authority must not be bored merciful or amused or the anatomist and healer of bones trepanner skilled in suturing the masked and sterile hero in the cone of light there the sweet ether cone must be inhaled with one two pulses of the fiery spiral singing into timeless speed or quiet a mound under a sheet a square of pale mortal flesh incised in a seeping line spreading its lips for pretty butchery blankets hypodermics and high fever racing delirium in the ward the tall screen efficiently deployed at the bedside intravenous ministrations charts starch and how is he today pretty good doc or else the fly sits down on the dead face in the dead sunny room shall i have speech with those undone by the world ’ s great memory men translated by music treasurers of the french phrase the childhood images unregarded announcers of prophecy staring blind at the stained wall paper in their nightly rooms their dreadful hearts beating the beds where other hearts have slept like birds under the night wind of time see this one whom the currents under earth intoxicate and the flosses of the sky weeping weeping in vanity and grief he walks toward remote dawn in the empty city facing the cold draft fish-smell from the river necessitous of love masters of intricate fancy libertines of intelligence i. until jove let it be no colonist mastered the wild earth no land was marked none parceled out or shared but everyone looked for his living in the common wold and jove gave poison to the blacksnakes and made the wolves ravage made the ocean roll knocked honey from the leaves took fire away— so man might beat out various inventions by reasoning and art first he chipped fire out of the veins of flint where it was hidden then rivers felt his skiffs of the light alder then sailors counted up the stars and named them pleiades hyades and the pole star then were discovered ways to take wild things in snares or hunt them with the circling pack and how to whip a stream with casting nets or draw the deep-sea fisherman ’ s cordage up and then the use of steel and the shrieking saw then various crafts all things were overcome by labor and by force of bitter need ii even when your threshing floor is leveled by the big roller smoothed and packed by hand with potter ’ s clay so that it will not crack there are still nuisances the tiny mouse locates his house and granary underground or the blind mole tunnels his dark chamber the toad too and all monsters of the earth besides those plunderers of the grain the weevil and frantic ant scared of a poor old age let me speak then too of the farmer ’ s weapons the heavy oaken plow and the plowshare the slowly rolling carts of demeter the threshing machine the sledge the weighted mattock the withe baskets the cheap furniture the harrow and the magic winnowing fan— all that your foresight makes provision of if you still favor the divine countryside iii moreover like men tempted by the straits in ships borne homeward through the blowing sea we too must reckon on arcturus star the days of luminous draco and the kids when libra makes the hours of sleep and daylight equal dividing the world half light half dark then drive the team and sow the field with barley even under intractable winter ’ s rain but spring is the time to sow your beans and clover when shining taurus opens the year with his golden horns and the dog ’ s averted star declines for greater harvests of your wheat and spelt let first the pleiades and hyades be hid and ariadne ’ s diadem go down the golden sun rules the great firmament through the twelve constellations and the world is measured out in certain parts and heaven by five great zones is taken up entire one glowing with sundazzle and fierce heat and far away on either side the arctics frozen with ice and rain cerulean and in between two zones for sick mankind through each of these a slanting path is cut where pass in line the zodiacal stars northward the steep world rises to scythia and south of libya descends where black styx and the lowest of the dead look on in the north sky the snake glides like a river winding about the great and little bear— those stars that fear forever the touch of ocean southward they say profound night mother of furies sits tight-lipped among the crowding shades or thence aurora draws the daylight back and where the east exhales the yellow morning reddening evening lights her stars at last iv as for the winter when the freezing rains confine the farmer he may employ himself in preparations for serener seasons the plowman beats the plowshare on the forge or makes his vats of tree-trunks hollowed out brands his cattle numbers his piles of grain sharpens fence posts or pitchforks prepares umbrian trellises for the slow vine then you may weave the baskets of bramble twigs or dip your bleating flock in the clean stream often the farmer loads his little mule with olive oil or apples and brings home a grindstone or a block of pitch from market and some will stay up late beside the fire on winter nights whittling torches while the housewife runs the shuttle through the loom and comforts the long labor with her singing or at the stove she simmers the new wine skimming the froth with leaves oh idle time in that hale season all their worries past farmers arrange convivialities— as after laden ships have reached home port the happy sailors load the prow with garlands then is the time to gather acorns and laurel berries and the bloodred myrtle to lay your traps for cranes and snares for buck to hit the fallow deer with twisted slingshots and track the long-eared hare— when snow is deep and ice is on the rivers v. what of the humors and the ways of autumn just when the farmer wished to reap his yellow fields and thresh his grain i have often seen all the winds make war flattening the stout crops from the very roots and in the black whirlwind carrying off the ears and the light straw and often mighty phalanxes of rain marched out of heaven as the clouds rolled up from the sea the detestable tempest then the steep aether thundered and the deluge soaked the crops filled ditches made the rivers rise and roar and seethe in their spuming beds the father himself in the mid stormy night lets the lightning go at whose downstroke enormous earth quivers wild things flee and fear abases the prone hearts of men— as jove splits athos with his firebolt or rhodope or the ceraunian ridge the southwind wails in sheets of rain and under that great wind the groves lament and the long breast of the shore is shaken if you dislike to be so caught mark well the moon ’ s phases and the weather signs notice where saturn ’ s frigid star retires mercury ’ s wanderings over heaven and revere especially the gods offer to ceres annual sacrifice and annual worship in the first fair weather of the spring so may your sheep grow fat and your vines fruitful your sleep sweet and your mountains full of shade let all the country folk come to adore her and offer her libations of milk and wine conduct the sacrificial lamb three times around the ripe field in processional with all your chorus singing out to ceres and let no man lay scythe against his grain unless he first bind oakleaves on his head and make his little dance and sing to her vi when shall we herd the cattle to the stables the wind say rises without intermission the sea gets choppy and the swell increases the dry crash of boughs is heard on hills the long sound of the surf becomes a tumult the gusts become more frequent in the grove the waves begin to fight against the keels from far at sea the gulls fly shoreward crying the heron leaves his favorite marsh and soars over the high cloud then you will see beyond thin skimrack shooting stars falling the long pale tracks behind them whitening through the darkness of the night and you ’ ll see straw and fallen leaves blowing but when it thunders in rough boreas ’ quarter when east and west it thunders—every sailor furls his dripping sail a storm should never catch you unprepared aerial cranes take flight before its rising the restless heifer with dilated nostrils sniffs the air the squeaking hirondelle flits round and round the lake and frogs inveterate in their mud croak a chorale and too the ant more frantic in his gallery trundles his eggs out from their hiding place the rainbow cloud imbiber may be seen and crows go cawing from the pasture in a harsh throng of crepitating wings the jeering jay gives out his yell for rain and takes a walk by himself on the dry sand stormwise the various sea-fowl and such birds as grub the sweet swan river in asia may be observed dousing themselves and diving or riding on the water as if they wished— what odd exhilaration—to bathe themselves vii after a storm clear weather and continuing sunny days may likewise be foretold by the sharp twinkle of the stars the moon rising to face her brother ’ s rays by day no tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky no halcyons sea favorites on the shore stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight but mists go lower and lie on the fields the owl observing sundown from his perch modulates his meaningless melancholy aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk chases his prey and as she flits aside the fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind and as he swoops she flits aside again with funereal contractions of the windpipe the crows produce their caws three at a time and in their high nests pleased at i know not what noise it among themselves no doubt rejoicing to see their little brood after the storm but not i think by reason of divine insight or superior grasp of things viii but if you carefully watch the rapid sun and the moon following a fair night ’ s snare never deceives you as to next day ’ s weather when the new moon collects a rim of light if that bow be obscured with a dark vapor then a great tempest is in preparation if it be blushing like a virgin ’ s cheek there will be wind wind makes diana blush if on the fourth night most significant she goes pure and unclouded through the sky all that day and the following days will be for one full month exempt from rain and wind the sun too rising and setting in the waves will give you weather signs trustworthy ones whether at morning or when stars come out a mackerel sky over the east at sunrise means look out for squalls a gale is coming unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks or when through denser strata the sun ’ s rays break out dimly or aurora rises pale from tithonus ’ crocus-colored chamber alas the vine-leaf will not shield the cluster in the hubbub of roof-pattering bitter hail it will be well to notice sunset too for the sun ’ s visage then has various colors bluish and dark means rain if it be fiery that means an east wind if it be dappled and mixed with red gold light then you will see wind and rain in commotion everywhere nobody can advise me on that night to cast off hawsers and put out to sea but if the next day passes and the sunset then be clear you need not fear the weather a bright norther will sway the forest trees ix last what the late dusk brings and whence the fair clouds are blown and secrets of the southwind you may learn from the sun whose prophecies no man denies seeing black insurrections treacheries and wars are told by him when caesar died the great sun pitied rome so veiling his bright head the godless time trembled in fear of everlasting night and then were portents given of earth and ocean vile dogs upon the roads and hideous strange birds and aetna quaking and her fires bursting to overflow the cyclops ’ fields with flames whirled in the air and melted stones thunder of war was heard in germany from south to north shaking the granite alps and a voice also through the silent groves piercing and apparitions wondrous pale were seen in dead of night then cattle spoke o horror streams stood still the earth cracked open and tears sprang even from the temple bronze the po monarch of rivers on his back spuming whole forests raced through the lowland plains and bore off pens and herds and then continually the viscera of beasts were thick with evil blood trickled from the springs tall towns at night re-echoed to the wolf-pack ’ s shivering howl and never from pure heaven have there fallen so many fires nor baleful comets burned it seemed that once again the roman lines alike in arms would fight at philippi and heaven permitted those thessalian fields to be enriched again with blood of ours some future day perhaps in that country a farmer with his plow will turn the ground and find the javelins eaten thin with rust or knock the empty helmets with his mattock and wonder digging up those ancient bones paternal gods ancestors mother vesta you that guard tiber and the palatine now that long century is overthrown let not this young man fail to give us peace long enough beneath your rule o caesar heaven has hated us and all those triumphs where justice was thrown down—so many wars so many kinds of wickedness no honor rendered the plow but the fields gone to ruin the country-folk made homeless and their scythes beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge war from the euphrates to germany ruptured engagements violence of nations and impious mars raging the whole world over— as when a four horsed chariot rears away plunging from the barrier and runs wild heedless of the reins or the charioteer terrorizers of themselves laughers in language and priests of any mystery— not by authority what of the revered historian the painstaking public man his dusty briefcase worn to a splitting bulge the scholar descending from the library smiles at the doves and at the glowing grass letters gone frail and yellow in their strings spill fuzz and dust from the stuck folds it might be inferred from what the ambassador wrote to his daughter in virginia that others were privy to the situation these judges are gentle and well-cultivated honorable stylists penetrating men mirrors of duplicity and bewilderment mirrors of magnificent deep-rooted structural policy and implacable miscarriage the documents are all photostated the files arranged let humane logic guide them in the wilderness of the state the pallid husbandman grunts at his fields sells his new lambs in the damp of march thumbs the slick catalogue of the mail order house for ginghams for the girls of summer chews with the county agent at the gate he will be ruddy as the sun goes over the clouds go over the tractor shudders on through the high fields the piling west will grow fractious with lightning the wild branches bend curtains blow out like goodbye handkerchiefs hilarious in the gloomy wind autumn comes with marriages to the aging house winter comes with comforts and old death still the farmer ’ s dull hand holds the seed the low star glimmers on the dewy sill
an ode attempted in english sapphic when the fierce north wind with his airy forces rears up the baltic to a foaming fury and the red lightning with a storm of hail comes rushing amain down how the poor sailors stand amazed and tremble while the hoarse thunder like a bloody trumpet roars a loud onset to the gaping waters quick to devour them such shall the noise be and the wild disorder if things eternal may be like these earthly such the dire terror when the great archangel shakes the creation tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven breaks up old marble the repose of princes see the graves open and the bones arising flames all around ’ em hark the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches lively bright horror and amazing anguish stare through their eyelids while the living worm lies gnawing within them thoughts like old vultures prey upon their heart-strings and the smart twinges when the eye beholds the lofty judge frowning and a flood of vengeance rolling afore him hopeless immortals how they scream and shiver while devils push them to the pit wide-yawning hideous and gloomy to receive them headlong down to the center stop here my fancy all away ye horrid doleful ideas come arise to jesus how he sits god-like and the saints around him throned yet adoring oh may i sit there when he comes triumphant dooming the nations then ascend to glory while our hosannas all along the passage shout the redeemer
death thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing nothing but bones the sad effect of sadder groans thy mouth was open but thou couldst not sing for we considered thee as at some six or ten years hence after the loss of life and sense flesh being turned to dust and bones to sticks we looked on this side of thee shooting short where we did find the shells of fledge souls left behind dry dust which sheds no tears but may extort but since our savior ’ s death did put some blood into thy face thou art grown fair and full of grace much in request much sought for as a good for we do now behold thee gay and glad as at doomsday when souls shall wear their new array and all thy bones with beauty shall be clad therefore we can go die as sleep and trust half that we have unto an honest faithful grave making our pillows either down or dust
farewell sweet cooke-ham where i first obtained grace from that grace where perfect grace remained and where the muses gave their full consent i should have power the virtuous to content where princely palace willed me to indite the sacred story of the soul ’ s delight farewell sweet place where virtue then did rest and all delights did harbor in her breast never shall my sad eyes again behold those pleasures which my thoughts did then unfold yet you great lady mistress of that place from whose desires did spring this work of grace vouchsafe to think upon those pleasures past as fleeting worldly joys that could not last or as dim shadows of celestial pleasures which are desired above all earthly treasures oh how methought against you thither came each part did seem some new delight to frame the house received all ornaments to grace it and would endure no foulness to deface it and walks put on their summer liveries and all things else did hold like similes the trees with leaves with fruits with flowers clad embraced each other seeming to be glad turning themselves to beauteous canopies to shade the bright sun from your brighter eyes the crystal streams with silver spangles graced while by the glorious sun they were embraced the little birds in chirping notes did sing to entertain both you and that sweet spring and philomela with her sundry lays both you and that delightful place did praise oh how me thought each plant each flower each tree set forth their beauties then to welcome thee the very hills right humbly did descend when you to tread on them did intend and as you set your feet they still did rise glad that they could receive so rich a prize the gentle winds did take delight to be among those woods that were so graced by thee and in sad murmur uttered pleasing sound that pleasure in that place might more abound the swelling banks delivered all their pride when such a phoenix once they had espied each arbor bank each seat each stately tree thought themselves honored in supporting thee the pretty birds would oft come to attend thee yet fly away for fear they should offend thee the little creatures in the burrough by would come abroad to sport them in your eye yet fearful of the bow in your fair hand would run away when you did make a stand now let me come unto that stately tree wherein such goodly prospects you did see that oak that did in height his fellows pass as much as lofty trees low growing grass much like a comely cedar straight and tall whose beauteous stature far exceeded all how often did you visit this fair tree which seeming joyful in receiving thee would like a palm tree spread his arms abroad desirous that you there should make abode whose fair green leaves much like a comely veil defended phoebus when he would assail whose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air joying his happiness when you were there where being seated you might plainly see hills vales and woods as if on bended knee they had appeared your honor to salute or to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit all interlaced with brooks and crystal springs a prospect fit to please the eyes of kings and thirteen shires appeared all in your sight europe could not afford much more delight what was there then but gave you all content while you the time in meditation spent of their creator ’ s power which there you saw in all his creatures held a perfect law and in their beauties did you plain descry his beauty wisdom grace love majesty in these sweet woods how often did you walk with christ and his apostles there to talk placing his holy writ in some fair tree to meditate what you therein did see with moses you did mount his holy hill to know his pleasure and perform his will with lowly david you did often sing his holy hymns to heaven ’ s eternal king and in sweet music did your soul delight to sound his praises morning noon and night with blessed joseph you did often feed your pined brethren when they stood in need and that sweet lady sprung from clifford ’ s race of noble bedford ’ s blood fair stem of grace to honorable dorset now espoused in whose fair breast true virtue then was housed oh what delight did my weak spirits find in those pure parts of her well framèd mind and yet it grieves me that i can not be near unto her whose virtues did agree with those fair ornaments of outward beauty which did enforce from all both love and duty unconstant fortune thou art most to blame who casts us down into so low a frame where our great friends we can not daily see so great a difference is there in degree many are placed in those orbs of state partners in honor so ordained by fate nearer in show yet farther off in love in which the lowest always are above but whither am i carried in conceit my wit too weak to conster of the great why not although we are but born of earth we may behold the heavens despising death and loving heaven that is so far above may in the end vouchsafe us entire love therefore sweet memory do thou retain those pleasures past which will not turn again remember beauteous dorset ’ s former sports so far from being touched by ill reports wherein myself did always bear a part while reverend love presented my true heart those recreations let me bear in mind which her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find whereof deprived i evermore must grieve hating blind fortune careless to relieve and you sweet cooke-ham whom these ladies leave i now must tell the grief you did conceive at their departure when they went away how everything retained a sad dismay nay long before when once an inkling came methought each thing did unto sorrow frame the trees that were so glorious in our view forsook both flowers and fruit when once they knew of your depart their very leaves did wither changing their colors as they grew together but when they saw this had no power to stay you they often wept though speechless could not pray you letting their tears in your fair bosoms fall as if they said why will ye leave us all this being vain they cast their leaves away hoping that pity would have made you stay their frozen tops like age ’ s hoary hairs shows their disasters languishing in fears a swarthy riveled rind all over spread their dying bodies half alive half dead but your occasions called you so away that nothing there had power to make you stay yet did i see a noble grateful mind requiting each according to their kind forgetting not to turn and take your leave of these sad creatures powerless to receive your favor when with grief you did depart placing their former pleasures in your heart giving great charge to noble memory there to preserve their love continually but specially the love of that fair tree that first and last you did vouchsafe to see in which it pleased you oft to take the air with noble dorset then a virgin fair where many a learned book was read and scanned to this fair tree taking me by the hand you did repeat the pleasures which had passed seeming to grieve they could no longer last and with a chaste yet loving kiss took leave of which sweet kiss i did it soon bereave scorning a senseless creature should possess so rare a favor so great happiness no other kiss it could receive from me for fear to give back what it took of thee so i ungrateful creature did deceive it of that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it and though it oft had given me much content yet this great wrong i never could repent but of the happiest made it most forlorn to show that nothing ’ s free from fortune ’ s scorne while all the rest with this most beauteous tree made their sad consort sorrow ’ s harmony the flowers that on the banks and walks did grow crept in the ground the grass did weep for woe the winds and waters seemed to chide together because you went away they knew not whither and those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear with grief and trouble wrinkled did appear those pretty birds that wonted were to sing now neither sing nor chirp nor use their wing but with their tender feet on some bare spray warble forth sorrow and their own dismay fair philomela leaves her mournful ditty drowned in deep sleep yet can procure no pity each arbor bank each seat each stately tree looks bare and desolate now for want of thee turning green tresses into frosty gray while in cold grief they wither all away the sun grew weak his beams no comfort gave while all green things did make the earth their grave each brier each bramble when you went away caught fast your clothes thinking to make you stay delightful echo wonted to reply to our last words did now for sorrow die the house cast off each garment that might grace it putting on dust and cobwebs to deface it all desolation then there did appear when you were going whom they held so dear this last farewell to cooke-ham here i give when i am dead thy name in this may live wherein i have performed her noble hest whose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast and ever shall so long as life remains tying my life to her by those rich chains

there was the method of kneeling a fine method if you lived in a country where stones were smooth the women dreamed wistfully of bleached courtyards hidden corners where knee fit rock their prayers were weathered rib bones small calcium words uttered in sequence as if this shedding of syllables could somehow fuse them to the sky there were the men who had been shepherds so long they walked like sheep under the olive trees they raised their arms— hear us we have pain on earth we have so much pain there is no place to store it but the olives bobbed peacefully in fragrant buckets of vinegar and thyme at night the men ate heartily flat bread and white cheese and were happy in spite of the pain because there was also happiness some prized the pilgrimage wrapping themselves in new white linen to ride buses across miles of vacant sand when they arrived at mecca they would circle the holy places on foot many times they would bend to kiss the earth and return their lean faces housing mystery while for certain cousins and grandmothers the pilgrimage occurred daily lugging water from the spring or balancing the baskets of grapes these were the ones present at births humming quietly to perspiring mothers the ones stitching intricate needlework into children ’ s dresses forgetting how easily children soil clothes there were those who didn ’ t care about praying the young ones the ones who had been to america they told the old ones you are wasting your time time —the old ones prayed for the young ones they prayed for allah to mend their brains for the twig the round moon to speak suddenly in a commanding tone and occasionally there would be one who did none of this the old man fowzi for example fowzi the fool who beat everyone at dominoes insisted he spoke with god as he spoke with goats and was famous for his laugh

1 no one knows where i ’ m going not even me although that owl i heard outside last night might lead me to the terrain and call out the custodians so they can surround and welcome me or do whatever they want to do i won ’ t speak won ’ t say my name even if they try to coerce me or play unearthly music such as sailors hear far out on the atlantic in fog so thick they venture to climb it to reach clear sky some do and speak of large blue birds that glide there silently as ghosts but those men return too damaged to speak much or stay above ground very long the owl could tell more if he wanted but he won ’ t and not only that he ’ s decided he will never be seen 2 i ’ m happy to honor that but i ’ d like to know what kind of owl he is i mean is he blue or is he striped so he can blend with the forest is he tall and white from the arctic or a pygmy from further south is he long-eared or spectacled i want to hear again the noise he made was it a screech or a staccato huhuhu followed by a deep-drawn whoo or did it sound like wood being sawn i am ashamed i paid it no attention i did not know then he was a messenger albeit a taciturn one how does he know me and why is he so interested once a parrot took stock of me learnt to speak my name in exactly the tones i said it in mimicked it endlessly and so loudly that i ran from my laughing friend ’ s house with my shrill-voiced name hurling after me 3 where does the owl go during the day how can he know i ’ ll still be here when he surfaces i do take trains — i go north sometimes pulled by my past i fly to places will he know all this and follow me everywhere when can i expect his sounds to morph into spoken words that i understand and act on if i agree with him but if i decide to stay put never leave the bedroom will he get fed up standing there and row away through the night air hooting a farewell i don ’ t think so no this fellow is here for the duration of my stay on this enormous ball and could tell right now how long that will be and what messy adventures are still ahead of me but his trick is to keep as schtum on such stuff as the wooden owl on my bedside table 4 i ’ ve heard stories about owls how they appear from nowhere at the edge of things to sit watching usually staying silent but sometimes uttering a few words in their night language we don ’ t understand that ’ s my fellow although i don ’ t know him should i leave the house and hold my right arm out for him to land on and turn his big eyes on me as if he ’ d be so compliant or should i try to forget him pretend he ’ s not there in the dark like a tree i hadn ’ t noticed growing oh at least i should stop mentioning him here but what else can i write about not the journey i ’ m taking that i know nothing of not yet and when i do i mightn ’ t feel like writing i think the solution might be to buy a t-shirt with an owl printed on it a blue owl on a yellow shirt and write about that small fellow to begin with 5 what i want to learn is this do owls ever venture inside to stand on a corner- table cock their heads to one side and take in completely what ’ s going on there are mice here that may be welcome but i know my owl would be suspicious he ’ d assume i want him inside to see what he looks like to make friends with him so he ’ ll be kind to me i could promise to wear a blindfold and say nothing act like i don ’ t know he ’ s there but i will know and that ’ s enough i think i hear his thoughts and i ’ m sure he hears mine i feel his big eyes on me all the time maybe i should start carrying the wooden owl around with me and practice owl noises when is he going to tell me what he has to i ’ m not asking for a map but i ’ d like to know where i ’ m headed if not where i ’ ll end up and i ’ d like to know it as soon as i can 6 when i say i hear his thoughts i hear some not the important ones and here ’ s one of mine — if he ventured inside this house he ’ d see something that might intrigue him a hand-knitted toilet roll cover in rings of purple red and white like an unknown planet hanging in the sky i ’ d let him have it take it back to his nest or his hollow tree trunk or his half-sunken boat i know he ’ ll assume this is another example of special pleading and i accept that would i do better to ignore him let him stay out there like a pinecone that remains unobserved i saw my doctor yesterday he spoke of the deterioration and i felt the owl was hiding in a cupboard agreeing with every word after that i went to my sister ’ s grave and the owl flew back to wherever he ’ s been ordered to lurk while observing me maybe i should feel privileged to have his full-time attention 7 this morning i captured a beetle climbing the parsley i put him in an empty matchbox wondering what the owl thought of this would it impact what might be unfolding i doubted this i slipped on some spidery jazz that i knew would annoy the owl he needed to be in control i ground coffee beans and made espresso the aroma wafted through the house i freed the beetle to explore the table and when it wandered off the edge i let it i ’ m sure it survived but i ’ m not bothered just as i know the owl doesn ’ t care about me we are thrown together all of us by winds that come here from far-off worlds i sipped my coffee humming the tune spun through the jazz and i felt quite well for the first time in weeks even months was the owl watching — had he been in contact with the beetle and what was their collective verdict on me did it add up to more negative evidence 8 ok i ’ m blanking him i watched a crow today really admired how he operated looking after the young ones his partner none of this spying on others i ’ ve decided i don ’ t like owls their self-absorption or their nosiness about people i know which i ’ d rather be and i don ’ t have to deal with a crow stalking me the owl would laugh about these thoughts he ’ s been given the task of waiting to release when he can exactly what i need to know or what he can reveal i admit he ’ s not easy but shit he ’ s the dumb card i ’ ve been dealt and i have to pretend i like him can i ask him about the oxford and cambridge rowers or about the hairdressers the louisianians use or the tiger cubs that texans keep as pets the owl would make minced meat of them all i wish he would hoot another noise to me i might even acknowledge his importance given my situation but i won ’ t reveal anything 9 i felt the presence of the owl last night he was in the room with me not literally — he appeared in a dream where a blue van struggled up an icy road before sliding back in a horrible wriggling way to what felt like an end i ’ m not sure how it seemed so and i can ’ t say where the owl was in this little film except he was definitely there this morning i came down the stairs expecting some sign from him i found a few brown feathers on a white plate on the kitchen table ok then he must be a brown owl but why donate some feathers and what did these denote i made coffee then put on a cd of anouar brahem ’ s oud that seemed to suit the moment and i decided it was the time to poach two eggs to serve on top of two slices of rye bread while i primed the espresso machine again and asked myself what the owl was saying 10 those feathers were gone from the plate when i went back for them this evening so i wondered if maybe i ’ d imagined them or if they ’ d fluttered up from the eggs before i ’ d poached them that doubt was caused by the owl i was sure — i ’ d made him careless and he was recovering his poise his control and i was back in the place where i knew nothing where he liked me to be i opened the door and stood there listening but no owl sound came then a bat just barely avoided my head and glided toward the moon i stood watching this leathery fellow then closed the door and opened some wine how much did the owl control would i be attacked by a rat tonight while i slept not savagely but enough to terrify me or would cockroaches swarm on my duvet clicking enough to wake me the idea being that these would render me so punch-drunk i ’ d welcome whatever the owl had to say 11 i spent the morning drawing owl after owl on bits of paper and after i ’ d got somewhere near a proper depiction i found a black marker and reproduced it on an a2 drawing page which i pritt sticked onto the gable wall then i dug out my old black bow and four arrows and unleashed these into the body of the owl i knew i was being provocative maybe even launching an act of war but i could take no more and couldn ’ t see what i had to lose the owl clearly was unmoved by this so i repeated the desecration four times over till the drawn owl looked machine-gunned whereupon i flung the bow down on the grass and went in to pour a large glass of talisker for the first time in months if not years it still tasted good i slipped on kind of blue which always chilled me and lay on the sofa with my shoes kicked off and the curtains wide open i thought let the owl do his worst 12 when the dark came i lurked in the kitchen bow in hand arrows in the quiver that hung from my left shoulder like the robin hood i wanted to play in the school pantomime — i got little john instead i kept looking out at the dark garden wondering if i should be there waiting to fire arrows at any sound or movement why did i want to kill the owl he hadn ’ t given me the news i dreaded but he ’ d stayed silent that was more than i could bear i poured a glass of malbec and put on a cd of baltic jazz did he think i could wait forever as if i were a rock i sliced some cheddar and a heel of bread opened the back door and went out the moon turned its big eye onto me and i saw it wobble the stars hummed along where am i going i shouted at all of them there was no response then far off i heard a faint huhuhu followed by a whoo you cowardly bastard i roared and sprayed the arrows all over the blackened world
i was one year old when my nanny went away leaving no memory of a face that watched arms that held hands that fed and cleaned me left no record of her voice or name my father died leaving wisps of pipe smoke for a memory my mother went away to write in london left me at her home place ballyrankin a sheltered farm in the slaney river valley i listened to stories from a paralyzed aunt sitting among sleepy dogs next to the fire statia cooked every day for the dining room churned butter gave sugared bread to me and her child bernie fed outside men in dirty boots and greasy caps in her stone-flagged kitchen that smelt of damp clothes roasting meat and cake i fished for minnows in shillelagh stream under ash trees where filtered sunlight made pools of silver water on one side horses grazed and swished their tails at flies on the far side cows rubbed their backs against low beech tree branches my mother went away to hospital left me with english neighbors the smythe vigours ’ hairy legs banged on passage floorboards my bedroom filled with evening sun they warned against crying i cried louder they took my pearl pink rosary beads given to me by a monk from a mountain monastery he told me holy mary answered children ’ s prayers a protestant child i didn ’ t know the words but i knew she ’ d hear me if i could catch the sunlight on her beads

concerned to dream that you do not succeed in love is a sign that you will marry and have a happy life to dream that you are in the company of your lover is also fortunate late 1743 kidnapped into the navy what else coming from mary ’ s house taken from his own life focused into new pieces i dream about my fortune a fragrance captured in a jar a freckle without a wrist a wisp foxlike at the edge of the wind fortune is a dream of contraries the more fortunate and successful you are in imagination the greater will be your real struggles how do we fit together when we are not free what kind of animal are we how many heads do we have how many tails the sea is a strange piece of property on which to discuss this on the hms hardwick one month later midshipman john newton i have eaten war like a cluster of delicious fruit the ironic juices running from my lips that was my dream the reality of war is the dream of it beware of those things that appear so friendly but have no reason 1774 the hardwick ordered to the east indies first our hero visits mary again you ’ re wrong almost misses ship completely misses the point given small boat of men to go ashore at plymouth deserts my dreams here were father compass fog leakage and ultimately learning with us like our laundry we are always pulling from our past fossils are the dream of the sickness of someone you have not met for a long time when this happens brew herbs add honey and lemon sip and inhale deeply captured like a frog returned put in irons stripped flogged degraded returned to foremast this is that point many people would call a black moment an unfortunate color on things i will not do that for black is a contrary at funerals and our hero has just died a little as we all tend to from time to time and even though that is true i will not do that either i will not talk of the great white moment of death i will not talk of the great blue and purple moments in the prosperity of pain i will not talk of the great red or scarlet moments of quarrels and loss of friends or the crimson pleasure of the unexpected the mental tints of yellow and orange that show you should always expect change or the feeling of knowing green because you have been on a long journey all the colors are conjurers when our mysteries are being solved and if this could not be his dream then by now it should be ours we are not holy the wind says in the sails as he works it has never been otherwise though we live in the most devout of stories like litmus paper constantly changing color just to prove something is happening the sadness in his dream is a good omen for the future it is a quest for lasting joy and so is punishment a dream of unexpected pleasure works quietly for weeks his silence darns a temperate healing thread his eyes become an elaborate decorative art avoiding everyone “ every month ” said cicero “ the moon contemplates its trajectory and the shrubs and animals grow. ” he has done to himself what is easy he must now blossom out of his new secrets even if joy is ephemeral suddenly he begins to sing creates songs about fish and clouds fish are a dream of penetrative motion clouds are a dream of appearances always in a state of change we must be patient with the overfecundity of his youth we must let him climb and descend the mast like a weapon trade him to a slaver ’ s ship to subdue the threat to discipline in his strangely awakening joy we must let him choose his monsters and the myths of his own worth — the enemy always being the forces threatening from within paul said “ we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ” suddenly begins to breathe different songs in his six-months ’ stay along the sierra leone coast troublesome songs songs of quick wit and devastating rhymes ridiculing ship ’ s officers crew loves them becomes a choir to dream that you hear other people singing shows that the difficulties that will come for you will come through your dealings with other people the irate mate assuming command after the death of the captain threatens to put newton on a man-o ’ -war the royal navy is not an obstacle dream it is an elaborate exhibition of the nuances of living death occupation slave dealer place sierra leone on one of the plantanes features short white male name clow other information black wife name sounds like p.i john newton bargains his life into this extravagant story he will become a slave because p.i will hate him he will become ill with fever he will be denied food denied water tormented by black slaves on command put to work on a lime tree plantation enjoying only the scents and dreaming of his earthly desires will master the six books of euclid drawing the diagrams with a long stick in the wet sand six is like two a particularly ambiguous number to dream about but it establishes equilibrium it unifies the triangles of fire and water and symbolizes the human soul six is the hermaphrodite a personality integrated despite its duality if this is a story of the reasoning of slavery where are we what have we been doing to people to the light from which life emanates slavery is a story of procreation of magic religious thinking of the androgynous divinity within us no story can be this happy unless it is married to something deeply within us it is not them who have done it to us or us who have done it to them it is the antagonistic dream of unreconciled love to dream of erotic love is to dream of the desire to die in the object of desire to dissolve in that which is already dissolved the book of baruch says erotic desire and its satisfaction is the key to the origin of the world disappointment in love and the revenge which follows in its wake are the roots of all the evil and selfishness in the world the whole of history is the work of love 2 “ the character of the image ” said shukrâchârya “ is determined by the relationship between the worshipper and the worshipped. ” on the beach he eats the fruit of his own way he fills himself with his own devices he continues to draw in the sand each grain is a small precise form of salvation that has occurred a god come to earth in another form a private innate sacrifice providence does not tire we are ready to go on with the story it has come to this when his father dreams he only sees the broad face of sadness the soft grassland where only asphodels grow and the idea of water expanding into tears but to dream of sadness is a good omen a transportation of suffering to the spiritual this dream is like an herb a seasoning a bitter root medicinal something poisonous but nevertheless something that eventually withers away when you come on to squally weather when the wind is about sw when you sway up the yard fix the trysail put people to making sennit and swab ask for my son ask the lamb the beverly the golden lyon ask job lewis have you seen my boy have you seen my boy one thousand years before christ solomon said that the way of a ship in the midst of the sea was too wonderful for him to understand meanwhile clow shamed into freeing his fellow white man after all they share the same hair the same instinctual life the same irrational power there is no victim here this is a story of love ’ s sadness of the spirit of love ’ s ferocity and savage insensibility and the name of jesus turned in hymns spewed into the fringes of the forest spewed on the deep blue sea what dream is this is that what you said my god this is the dream of the dragon the fabulous animal the amalgam of aggression the serpent the crocodile the lion what we like to think is the antediluvian nature of love john is free now john is free to slave free to be reluctant to give up profit and return home ask the master of the greyhound have you seen my boy have you seen my boy to find money in your dream is not fortunate at all there will be some sudden advancement or success but it will prove disappointing reader remember this statement by virgil “ it will be pleasant to remember these things hereafter. ” you can not blame the sea on a woman unlike the seasons it has no ribs though it has a crown wears a sheath swings a sickle adores the sun and is known as bareheaded and leafless the sea is the emblem of the great capricious world the naked image of flux vibrating between life and death there is a dream called “ dire is the tossing deep the groans come let us heel list and stoop. ” and when john heard this on his way home it was as if he had read 2 kings 10:16 “ come with me brother and see my zeal for the lord. ” for twelve months the greyhound sought gold ivory dyer ’ s wood beeswax and newton sought the lord the way of a ship in the midst of the sea is too wonderful to understand youth is not innocence it is not a militant puzzlement it is a methodological initiation into the ubiquitous life of sin for a life without sin is no life at all and so he wanders on like paul so very christian about it at once wretched and delivered thinking with his mind he is serving god but with his flesh the law of sin call out john newton call out to joshua ruth samuel obadiah esther zechariah luke and timothy the world is a masterfully round secret that embraces everything and it is time to reach into the horizon now it is time to choose your ship and the triangle of your life upon the salty sea as you can see dreams are without reason without solution without proof the unedited version of our love our aspiration our hurt call out john newton call out back home offered captaincy of ship refuses sails as first mate on the brownlow collects slaves takes them to south carolina he begins to dream of questions “ what was the mode used in stowing the slaves in their apartments ” returns home marries mary cattlett assumes first command the duke of argyle 140 tons burthen marriage is the dream of sulfur and mercury some believe it is a most fortunate omen a volatile conciliation a fragile union they are right it is one of the great uncharted seas of individuation it is

truth “ at noon some small rain had an indifferent observation ” “ we take the two men-boys for some shallop rigging we do not take the two fallen-breasted women ” “ dear mary today saw my quondam black mistress p.i — i believe i made her sorry for her former ill treatment of me. ” the trouble with atonement is it is like a sphinx several parts human several parts bull dog lion dragon or bird when we are dreaming of atonement no matter how subtly we must remember we are not dreaming of a verb “ i watch them work the tie tackle and lower lift the boatswain speaks to bredson about the score in one of the strops thomas creed sits with his splicing fids tucks the strands of the tack cringle his fingers are either little mystics or snakes. ” when you dream the dream of square-sail rigging you are dreaming the dream that the same side is always before the wind at the dawn of swedish history it was believed erik vädderhatt the king of the svear could turn the wind and cruise endlessly ships are supposed to be emblems of transcendental joy “ do the male slaves ever dance under these circumstances ” “ after every meal they are made to jump in their irons but i can not call it dancing. ” “ what is the term that is usually given to it ” “ it is by the slave dealers called dancing. ” “ unclewed the sails they too in their shackles danced in the wind. ” “ dear mary i watched the land wind do to the sails what it does to our hair i dreamed of dancing with you into the cold water our wet clothes like nets and entanglements around our desire. ” they would call them up two by two equivocal unmasked making it possible to be classified forever pairs of birds pairs of oxen pairs of sheep reptiles lions elephants antediluvian carnivorous herbivorous fabulous beautiful ugly strange cocks locusts bears foxes and even flies all of them black all of them in colonnade to the gates of hell john did baptize in the wilderness did call out to judæa and jerusalem come lay down your life in the river jordan participate in his death and his resurrection they said they were refreshing them but the shackles still clanged and most of them still stank and many finding holes in the netting jumped overboard and baptized themselves bobbing in the adoring loins of the sea “ dear mary the three greatest blessings of which human nature is capable are undoubtedly religion liberty and love. ” the shape of a ship ’ s hull is determined by the materials methods of construction means of propulsion use fashion and whim this is a dream of law and the minute verities of justice the eighth enigma of the tarot first part fair the latter cloudy winds becoming unusual clouds dark great lightning i think of what we ’ ve done my own illumination before it is too late the palm and needle whippings the short splice blackwall hitches sheet bends quickly rummage the rigging details the yardarm blocks the tackles recall work on the pintles the rudder head have billinge check barricado and stores especially powder and slaves on this day of the second voyage of the african 1754 weighed bound by god ’ s permission to st. christophers we are ready for our justice to be winnowed like barley on the threshing floor the great dream of the dark with the lonely extroverted lamp the intuitive ship and the wind tossing on the innovative sea should moor somewhere “ why is this so ” asked kuo hsi for in our landscapes and our seascapes are the personalized items of our consciousness the coarse grist of our imagination the flirtatious metaphors stirring our ethics and the boldly stroked delineations of our unraveling possibilities and original nature through the night we were played with like kittens the slaves spilled out nightmares of themselves and groans we will all need dawn ’ s shawl this morning i hope she is good to us osiris was slain by set and put together again by isis john will dream like this off and on and then quit the sea this is his last voyage he will lose no slaves and no crew and it will be called a blessing at a time like this the egyptians would build a monolith to marry the enigmatic tension between life and death john will change his dreams now from the menstrual dreams of the slaver to the menthol dreams of the minister showing the devastating evil we do like a storm is only a stepping- stone to something else sing brother i will become sermons he says that understand what i ’ ve done sing i will become hymns bound in the skin of what i ’ ve done i will be patient with cowper inspiring to wilberforce and wordsworth i will attract the awakened crowds the abolitionist i will stand at the altar sing brother dressed in black testifying testifying i dream i will not be forgiving him for the timeliness of his innocence for betrothing the dead to the dead but will be lifting up my hands to an appetite for life that will take slavers and slaves with me i wish there was no timelessness that slavery was over and so far away it was an incredibly mysterious jungle — somewhere else an uncharted river canopied by extensive moss — somewhere else a spectacular ragged waterfall mystically expressed over an enormous obsidian wall but it is right here in my pouch today like the acori beads i have been swimming with for hours — presidential prime ministerial corporate grassroots based right here racist imperial and sexist right here woefully spendthrift and democratic anally retentive and republican militantly inappropriate and so good to itself that it jogs
even on easter sunday when the church was a jungle of lilies and ferns fat uncle paul who loved his liquor so would pound away with both fists on the stone pulpit shouting sin sin sin and the fiery fires of hell and i cried all after- noon the first time i heard what they did to jesus it was something the children shouldn ’ t know about till they were older but the new maid told me and both of us cried a lot and so mother got another one right away she sent away miss richardson who came all the way from england because she kept telling how her fiancé mr. bowles- lyon died suddenly of a heart attack he just said one day at lunch i ’ m afraid i ’ m not well and the next thing they knew he was sliding un- der the table easter was nice the eggs were silly but the big lilies were wonderful when uncle paul got so fat from drinking that he couldn ’ t squeeze into the pulpit anymore had to preach from the floor there was an el- ders ’ meeting and they said they would have the pulpit rebuilt but uncle paul said no it was the lord ’ s manifest will and he would pass his remaining years in sacred studies i liked thanksgiving better be- cause that was the day father took us down to the mills but easter i liked next best and the rabbits died because we fed them beet tops and the lamb pulled up the grass by the roots and was sold to mr. page the butcher i asked uncle robert what were sacred studies he said he was not really sure but he guessed they came in a bottle and mother sent me away from the table when i wouldn ’ t eat my lamb chops that was ridiculous she said it wasn ’ t the lamb of god it was just caesar an- dromache nibbles but i couldn ’ t i just couldn ’ t the year of the strike we didn ’ t go to church at all on easter because they said it wasn ’ t safe down town so instead we had prayers in the library and then right in the mid- dle the telephone rang it was mr. shupstead at the mill they had had to use tear gas father made a special prayer right a- way for god ’ s protection mercy and then he sent us out to the farm with mother we stayed a week and missed school but it rained a lot and i broke the bathroom mirror and had to learn a long psalm
a learned and a happy ignorance divided me from all the vanity from all the sloth care pain and sorrow that advance the madness and the misery of men no error no distraction i saw soil the earth or overcloud the sky i knew not that there was a serpent ’ s sting whose poison shed on men did overspread the world nor did i dream of such a thing as sin in which mankind lay dead they all were brisk and living wights to me yea pure and full of immortality joy pleasure beauty kindness glory love sleep day life light peace melody my sight my ears and heart did fill and freely move all that i saw did me delight the universe was then a world of treasure to me an universal world of pleasure unwelcome penitence was then unknown vain costly toys swearing and roaring boys shops markets taverns coaches were unshown so all things were that drown ’ d my joys no thorns chok ’ d up my path nor hid the face of bliss and beauty nor eclips ’ d the place only what adam in his first estate did i behold hard silver and dry gold as yet lay under ground my blessed fate was more acquainted with the old and innocent delights which he did see in his original simplicity those things which first his eden did adorn my infancy did crown simplicity was my protection when i first was born mine eyes those treasures first did see which god first made the first effects of love my first enjoyments upon earth did prove and were so great and so divine so pure so fair and sweet so true when i did meet them here at first they did my soul allure and drew away my infant feet quite from the works of men that i might see the glorious wonders of the deity

in one dream i am made watchful in this dream the name we never clearly have heard is spoken which name if we knew and could speak it would call back to us those whom in time we will have come to love and who will die would bring them back to us like us abandoned again to his terrible consequence the silence between us forever affirmed and in whatever might constitute the pardon would come down in a fragile rain the whole matter of all we will ever love the whole fiery blade of space ten billions of suns suddenly blossoming small and cool as snowdrops over the opening graves the world shimmering with the blue delicate membrane of the fallen sky while above us the forsaken voice calls out come back come back as if calling the name each of us had long forgotten until that very instant not remembered as proper to our hearts
i have forgotten the words and therefore i shall not conceive of a mysterious salvation i shall not become a tall lily and bloom into blue and white then what oracular event shall appear on my doorstep what announcement shall crowd me to a corner protesting an unworthiness which doubtless shall be believed but these are only bells we hear pulled down by the arms of the drunken janitor two fingers missing on his left hand and we have climbed into that tower its spiraling wooden staircase creaking beneath our feet we have seen for ourselves that it is only iron that rings iron swinging on an iron bar the rough rope threading down to the cold ground no death or holiness in those hollow shells
it was homemade and primitive like pulling a tooth with a string and a slamming door like taking out an appendix by kerosene light where dogs wandered in and out the dirt-floored room nothing for the pain that everyone wanted to examine the twisted heart they thought they could shout back into place moaning and fluttering their fleshy hands on the wind on the wail of the soul possessed they certified her in a manner inquisitional frantic when she held to the grip of darkness grimly determined to wait the thing out something learned from movie sheriffs white hats ghostly in the moonlight when she would not answer though they conjured her by heaven and by the all mighty names they knew they laid hands on her and shouted down the well of her eyes many tongues twisted in their mouths when she went leaving behind only the smallest tooth of wickedness
slowly the women file to where he stands upright in rimless glasses silver hair dark suit white collar stewards tirelessly persuade them onwards to his voice and hands within whose warm spring rain of loving care each dwells some twenty seconds now dear child what ’ s wrong the deep american voice demands and scarcely pausing goes into a prayer directing god about this eye that knee their heads are clasped abruptly then exiled like losing thoughts they go in silence some sheepishly stray not back into their lives just yet but some stay stiff twitching and loud with deep hoarse tears as if a kind of dumb and idiot child within them still survives to re-awake at kindness thinking a voice at last calls them alone that hands have come to lift and lighten and such joy arrives their thick tongues blort their eyes squeeze grief a crowd of huge unheard answers jam and rejoice— what ’ s wrong moustached in flowered frocks they shake by now all ’ s wrong in everyone there sleeps a sense of life lived according to love to some it means the difference they could make by loving others but across most it sweeps as all they might have done had they been loved that nothing cures an immense slackening ache as when thawing the rigid landscape weeps spreads slowly through them—that and the voice above saying dear child and all time has disproved
or the unfortunate story of the unmarried flora carrillo and the man who loved her before he died his famous death from whose single liaison a daughter was born and the advice rather the explanation both of them left for her and the story also of what she became and that she was happy 1. three did not count a fourth was forgiven by the father torres in exchange for reasonable payment two full days of the hail mary bigger than priests the fifth indiscretion was born on a thursday early evening in a november not too cold no rain had fallen and the birds had not yet gone she chose a black dress this flora florita here evoke the names of saints underneath which she carried tonight an old blade but of fine toledo forging long as the member of this man in love with this woman standing at his door her head was filled with the vines of the jungle the noises of a lion the feel of ten birds trying with their beaks to get out all anger that she had hoped he would come to her bedroom and that he had faster than that she took from him his rolled tongue hanging there between his thin legs his two-fingers this girl ’ s wrist and fist of his its central tendon and skin that moved on itself this small and second body of his which had found its way to her second mouth this part of himself which he had given her then taken back on this same day earlier his ugly afternoon of loving her too much he would scream as she had when she had taken him in first as a leg-bone and held him there too long too much until he had become a pinky-finger here evoke the holy names which she took now and put in the dowry she would make for her new daughter with it she would write a note nothing else was left to do daughter you will be an only child the story of your birth will smell on you do this take baths filled with rosemary with leaves with pinched orange peels keep secret the fact of yourself be happy enough happy with this much life ask for nothing do not live for a long time 2. he sang to her the oldest song that he was a piccolo flute in the small of her heart or if that were not convincing too much filled with flowers a small noise then a smart a cut which is healing its face feeling good to be scratched the way even wild cats like a piccolo flute in the small of her heart nothing more and nothing more necessary a noise different from all the rest louder and more shrill a good sound of haunting the voice of a muslim caller at dawn a bird a saturday four directions and a need he sang this and did not sing in that manner of speech afforded the heart that he was a man came to her not from any words not like that but from the measure of his breathing from the five-ladder depth of his left eye the one that did not move his one eye which while his right eye could move through the everyday could only stay looking at her when she looked at this eye at first the sight of it made a noise in her a start a note somewhere at the top of the piano scales fear almost a grasped breath a glass dropped in the moment was the music of being wanted or of wanting but she could not think it certainly she could only say no the way anyone would after a glass falls no and jesus and as an afterthought that he should go away many years later she read a book and it took her breath how neatly the glasses for champagne thrown by the fine heroes broke against the walls holding fire that this was a celebration that this was the continental the european no she said to this thick railroad tie of a man who sang to her the oldest song the one of being young that he was a piccolo flute in the small of her heart no she said but said it with her mouth not with her heart making no a spoken word like all other words so that he did not hear so that he kept singing until one day it was enough but not for her not now now instead the afternoon which was kind which is what she was earlier had only pretended for him i am her whispered it to him let him be strong in its arms one more time before it took him holding tighter than a grandmother this was not at all what he wanted but what he wanted he could not have no she said and he could not get close enough could not put the ear of his song heart against her chest to know what the word meant no 3. he had written no note for his daughter it had not been necessary she knew now what it would have been what the word no means when it is pronounced when the last half of it lingers o imagined that the o was like this together as if it were new nude in the afternoon they must have danced the wild apache without lunch into the hours imagining themselves french striped shirt and berets two carp on a rug in the ocean of the room two june beetles two bees beings with impossible wings pulleys from the roof pulling the two of them up like birthday piñatas two of them then four hands and legs tied more expertly than the best dream of an old salt sailor bread dough wound round and again into afternoon cakes two four then six of them all the parts of the face then twelve of them their two faces together twenty-four then and thirty-six and words and breaths inside each other their tongues like the wings of hummingbirds in flight like bees his fingers faster than possible that it was like this exactly 4. her fame was as a maker of oval mats many years later mats for placement behind photographs how the old ones were sometimes in colors sometimes to highlight sometimes for support simply always making the best faces but what she loved most what was true for her was her firm putting of the tongues and most heavy parts of several men of the town each on a different night sundays being specially reserved for the troubled boy on a rancho several kilometers out of town putting them slowly into her mouth this best of all and sucking there at them better than if she were drawing out the juice of an orange small hole made in it the way children do squeezing out the everything it was better described this deliverance of her men this taking out from their baby-arms what it was that troubled them so much all at once so much like the stories she had heard of the ghost being delivered being

when i wake up i can remember touching the back of your neck the cut of your hair blunt under my fingers in the dream you have met my mother my sisters and i are living in a grand house where i have no room of my own one of my sisters has delineated her property by stringing a rope from which she will hang photographs of our dead father at the beginning of christianity a bishop established what is called the `` canon of truth '' in order to unify feuding believers into a single way of apprehending the sacred his teachings excluded the workings of imagination as subjective vulnerable to self-interest and possibly insane your neck the blunt cut of your hair sharp and fragrant on my fingers you come to the big house you have just met my mother at a party where curtains of royal blue fell to the floor the music by scarlatti my hair is turning gray i look in the mirror the familiar dark hairs are fine and smooth the white are rough and thick like the fiber of which clouds are woven i want to pluck out the white hairs but my tweezer falls through them like logic through the sense of dreams i am getting old soon it will be too late your hand will slide from my skin like silk falling from a polished table in the big house you come to me and i show you my rectangle of floor it is here i will put my couch and desk separated from my sister and her pictures of our dead father by the edges of my body myself my thinking you consider me we stand there for a while my sister is attaching the large photographs of our father to a rope i look into the mirror at my white hair i have sworn i will never dye it but now i must the white hairs are growing as fast as snow falls across a landscape soon snow will obliterate the town and countryside there will be no houses visible cars will disappear under the mass of it trees will become poignant marks on a dangerous blank my sister strings photographs of our dead father along the rope attaching them with small invisible clips i wait for you i think about your face how you are becoming bald and then i remember touching you for the first time the back of your neck i was wondering how to find you what i would discover there it made me almost cry that you stayed perfectly still certain it seemed that what i was imparting was of utmost consequence i moved my fingers tentatively as if finding first knowledge in a terrain i could slip beneath into a garden i remembered that when i woke up that and your sticky skin certain early christian ideologues denigrated imagination as outside the realms of good and evil my mother is no longer dead and you have met her the air is transparent the colors dark wood and pale amber i am standing at the mirror watching white hair grow in as fast as snow what time is the train coming you sit at the window your legs crossed courtly and at ease you scrutinize my face until i am self-conscious i become aware that you are waiting for me i do n't know how to get to you some early christians those who came to be persecuted as heretics believed that a part of god is perpetually hidden from us in relation to that realm of the deity dwells imagination unceasingly seeking understanding of what is concealed i can see you on the window seat in an elegantly cut suit as if wearing such clothes were a form of grace i remember you in that suit standing in the hotel turning on your heel to look for me now the window is tall behind you twilight gathering outside the glass cedars black beyond the roses i am not dead yet i am mute as the dead usually are in dreams you are speaking in a clear voice explaining you have met my mother and that i look like her before sleep i was reading about early christianity when i woke up from the long dream there we were in the taxicab my arms tentative around you my fingers seeking the back of your neck i felt clearly the blunt edge of your newly cut hair the stickiness of your skin that mortal stickiness– when my mother 's mother was sixty her hair was still dark when my mother died at fifty her hair was still black though as she sickened it turned white black receding as life did i stand at the mirror its rare wide-beveled glass framed by oak carved to leaves and flowers i am scrutinizing myself my face is not ageing but my hair is turning white cloaking the trees falling on the meadow windblown across the frozen lake what heresy is it that you come to me in a dream knowing everything the tall windows rise to the ceiling but i do n't lift my eyes i do n't want to lose sight of you outside the cedars beyond them a smooth body of water

it used to be more private—just the immediate family gathered after mass the baptismal font at the rear of the church tiny as a bird bath the priest would ladle a few teaspoons ’ tepid holy water on the bundled baby ’ s forehead make a crack about the halo being too tight as the new soul wailed we ’ d go home to pancakes and eggs these days it ’ s a big holy-wood production— midmass the giant altar rolls back to reveal a jacuzzi tub surrounded by potted palms the priest hikes up his chasuble steps barefoot out of his black leather loafers and wades in like a newfangled john as organ music swells and the baby-bearing families line up like jumbo jets ready for takeoff but when the godparents handed my niece ’ s newborn naked to their parish priest and he dunked her into the jacuzzi ’ s bath-warm holy water her little one grew so calm and blissful she pooped—not a smelly three-days ’ worth explosive diaper load but enough to notice as the godparents scooped the turds with a handkerchief the savvy priest pretended he hadn ’ t seen swept through the fouled water with his palm before the next baby in line was submerged after mass my niece sat speechless red-faced not knowing what to say— or whether—as church ladies friends and family members presented one by one to the tub where the babies had been baptized as they knelt and bowed and dipped their fingers in and blessed themselves

love thou are absolute sole lord of life and death to prove the word we ’ ll now appeal to none of all those thy old soldiers great and tall ripe men of martyrdom that could reach down with strong arms their triumphant crown such as could with lusty breath speak loud into the face of death their great lord ’ s glorious name to none of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne for love at large to fill spare blood and sweat and see him take a private seat making his mansion in the mild and milky soul of a soft child scarce has she learn ’ d to lisp the name of martyr yet she thinks it shame life should so long play with that breath which spent can buy so brave a death she never undertook to know what death with love should have to do nor has she e ’ er yet understood why to show love she should shed blood yet though she can not tell you why she can love and she can die scarce has she blood enough to make a guilty sword blush for her sake yet has she ’ a heart dares hope to prove how much less strong is death than love be love but there let poor six years be pos ’ d with the maturest fears man trembles at you straight shall find love knows no nonage nor the mind ’ tis love not years or limbs that can make the martyr or the man love touch ’ d her heart and lo it beats high and burns with such brave heats such thirsts to die as dares drink up a thousand cold deaths in one cup good reason for she breathes all fire her weak breast heaves with strong desire of what she may with fruitless wishes seek for amongst her mother ’ s kisses since ’ tis not to be had at home she ’ ll travel to a martyrdom no home for hers confesses she but where she may a martyr be she ’ ll to the moors and trade with them for this unvalued diadem she ’ ll offer them her dearest breath with christ ’ s name in ’ t in change for death she ’ ll bargain with them and will give them god teach them how to live in him or if they this deny for him she ’ ll teach them how to die so shall she leave amongst them sown her lord ’ s blood or at least her own farewell then all the world adieu teresa is no more for you farewell all pleasures sports and joys never till now esteemed toys farewell whatever dear may be mother ’ s arms or father ’ s knee farewell house and farewell home she ’ s for the moors and martyrdom sweet not so fast lo thy fair spouse whom thou seek ’ st with so swift vows calls thee back and bids thee come t ’ embrace a milder martyrdom blest powers forbid thy tender life should bleed upon a barbarous knife or some base hand have power to rase thy breast ’ s chaste cabinet and uncase a soul kept there so sweet oh no wise heav ’ n will never have it so thou art love ’ s victim and must die a death more mystical and high into love ’ s arms thou shalt let fall a still-surviving funeral he is the dart must make the death whose stroke shall taste thy hallow ’ d breath a dart thrice dipp ’ d in that rich flame which writes thy spouse ’ s radiant name upon the roof of heav ’ n where aye it shines and with a sovereign ray beats bright upon the burning faces of souls which in that name ’ s sweet graces find everlasting smiles so rare so spiritual pure and fair must be th ’ immortal instrument upon whose choice point shall be sent a life so lov ’ d and that there be fit executioners for thee the fair ’ st and first-born sons of fire blest seraphim shall leave their quire and turn love ’ s soldiers upon thee to exercise their archery oh how oft shalt thou complain of a sweet and subtle pain of intolerable joys of a death in which who dies loves his death and dies again and would forever so be slain and lives and dies and knows not why to live but that he thus may never leave to die how kindly will thy gentle heart kiss the sweetly-killing dart and close in his embraces keep those delicious wounds that weep balsam to heal themselves with thus when these thy deaths so numerous shall all at last die into one and melt thy soul ’ s sweet mansion like a soft lump of incense hasted by too hot a fire and wasted into perfuming clouds so fast shalt thou exhale to heav ’ n at last in a resolving sigh and then o what ask not the tongues of men angels can not tell suffice thyself shall feel thine own full joys and hold them fast forever there so soon as thou shalt first appear the moon of maiden stars thy white mistress attended by such bright souls as thy shining self shall come and in her first ranks make thee room where ’ mongst her snowy family immortal welcomes wait for thee o what delight when reveal ’ d life shall stand and teach thy lips heav ’ n with his hand on which thou now mayst to thy wishes heap up thy consecrated kisses what joys shall seize thy soul when she bending her blessed eyes on thee those second smiles of heav ’ n shall dart her mild rays through thy melting heart angels thy old friends there shall greet thee glad at their own home now to meet thee all thy good works which went before and waited for thee at the door shall own thee there and all in one weave a constellation of crowns with which the king thy spouse shall build up thy triumphant brows all thy old woes shall now smile on thee and thy pains sit bright upon thee all thy sorrows here shall shine all thy suff ’ rings be divine tears shall take comfort and turn gems and wrongs repent to diadems ev ’ n thy deaths shall live and new dress the soul that erst they slew thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars as keep account of the lamb ’ s wars those rare works where thou shalt leave writ love ’ s noble history with wit taught thee by none but him while here they feed our souls shall clothe thine there each heav ’ nly word by whose hid flame our hard hearts shall strike fire the same shall flourish on thy brows and be both fire to us and flame to thee whose light shall live bright in thy face by glory in our hearts by grace thou shalt look round about and see thousands of crown ’ d souls throng to be themselves thy crown sons of thy vows the virgin-births with which thy sovereign spouse made fruitful thy fair soul go now and with them all about thee bow to him “ put on ” he ’ ll say “ put on my rosy love that thy rich zone sparkling with the sacred flames of thousand souls whose happy names heav ’ n keeps upon thy score thy bright life brought them first to kiss the light that kindled them to stars. ” and so thou with the lamb thy lord shalt go and wheresoe ’ er he sets his white steps walk with him those ways of light which who in death would live to see must learn in life to die like thee

we watched from the house as the river grew helpless and terrible in its unfamiliar body wrestling everything into it the water wrapped around trees until their life-hold was broken they went down one by one and the river dragged off their covering nests of the herons roots washed to bones snags of soaked bark on the shoreline a whole forest pulled through the teeth of the spillway trees surfacing singly where the river poured off into arteries for fields below the reservation when at last it was over the long removal they had all become the same dry wood we walked among them the branches whitening in the raw sun above us drifted herons alone hoarse-voiced broken settling their beaks among the hollows grandpa said these are the ghosts of the tree people moving among us unable to take their rest sometimes now we dream our way back to the heron dance their long wings are bending the air into circles through which they fall they rise again in shifting wheels how long must we live in the broken figures their necks make narrowing the sky
she sang beyond the genius of the sea the water never formed to mind or voice like a body wholly body fluttering its empty sleeves and yet its mimic motion made constant cry caused constantly a cry that was not ours although we understood inhuman of the veritable ocean the sea was not a mask no more was she the song and water were not medleyed sound even if what she sang was what she heard since what she sang was uttered word by word it may be that in all her phrases stirred the grinding water and the gasping wind but it was she and not the sea we heard for she was the maker of the song she sang the ever-hooded tragic-gestured sea was merely a place by which she walked to sing whose spirit is this we said because we knew it was the spirit that we sought and knew that we should ask this often as she sang if it was only the dark voice of the sea that rose or even colored by many waves if it was only the outer voice of sky and cloud of the sunken coral water-walled however clear it would have been deep air the heaving speech of air a summer sound repeated in a summer without end and sound alone but it was more than that more even than her voice and ours among the meaningless plungings of water and the wind theatrical distances bronze shadows heaped on high horizons mountainous atmospheres of sky and sea it was her voice that made the sky acutest at its vanishing she measured to the hour its solitude she was the single artificer of the world in which she sang and when she sang the sea whatever self it had became the self that was her song for she was the maker then we as we beheld her striding there alone knew that there never was a world for her except the one she sang and singing made ramon fernandez tell me if you know why when the singing ended and we turned toward the town tell why the glassy lights the lights in the fishing boats at anchor there as the night descended tilting in the air mastered the night and portioned out the sea fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles arranging deepening enchanting night oh blessed rage for order pale ramon the maker ’ s rage to order words of the sea words of the fragrant portals dimly-starred and of ourselves and of our origins in ghostlier demarcations keener sounds

in a dark time the eye begins to see i meet my shadow in the deepening shade i hear my echo in the echoing wood— a lord of nature weeping to a tree i live between the heron and the wren beasts of the hill and serpents of the den what ’ s madness but nobility of soul at odds with circumstance the day ’ s on fire i know the purity of pure despair my shadow pinned against a sweating wall that place among the rocks—is it a cave or winding path the edge is what i have a steady storm of correspondences a night flowing with birds a ragged moon and in broad day the midnight come again a man goes far to find out what he is— death of the self in a long tearless night all natural shapes blazing unnatural light dark dark my light and darker my desire my soul like some heat-maddened summer fly keeps buzzing at the sill which i is i a fallen man i climb out of my fear the mind enters itself and god the mind and one is one free in the tearing wind
1 in the rheumatic heat of july when public enemy blared on the blasters in a time when arbitrage and foreign policy were bureaus of each other i made a wrong turn off broadway and wound up at st. john the divine where i sat in the hot dark until the traffic died and a voice comes over some columns to the breeze of the golden horn over the cypress groves and flowing bougainvillea where the bright blue weather and the old seawalls come together where crates of cardamom and musk are piled and the cattle hang in blood above the brass where the grain boats stink and red pleasure barges drift where jason sailed for his fleece— a voice comes out of the dead water in great sophia light pours in rosy bars on the porphyry and the green marble till the air blooms and a chrysalis of lit crosses makes circles in the air light falls through the lunettes like arrows of gold that could ’ ve sneaked up the virgin ’ s dress had the holy ghost flitted in it would ’ ve been lost in the glare and the kiss of peace justinian blew from the ambo incantations flutter and rhyme in the apse like wings in a cloud of incense thinning on the gold-leafed vaults where the tongue ’ s vibration lingers in the upper air and rises and rises as if the dome could open to a half-hemisphere of heaven where in the translucent glitter of the kingdom the saints are poised in gracious robes with their thousand-year-frozen faces— the one truth glued on the grout of their lips 2 i sit with the incense of memory and a bath of dark pours from the vaults above the pew outside boutiques of money collide with the street fires in harlem whole skyscrapers are levitated by arbitrage and the only inside takeover i can negotiate is myself in this pew with my herringbone jacket which i should chuck in the salvation army bin down the block so i could join the line of choir- boys in their last innocent ritual as they stand before the mounted sermon sign “ he shall bring forth judgment unto truth ” isaiah 42:3 the puritans because they believed god ’ s altar needs not their polish lifted the boulder of truth higher than the glittering face of the nazarene once leaded in glass for the spirit they swallowed stones and shattered all the panes but beneath the lavender arch of a canon table in an old gospel i once tasted the consubstantial dewdrop in the faded color of a peacock ’ s wing so while a stone sinks to the bottom of my river a peacock ’ s wing floats by the shore who tells it like it is isaiah or procopius 3 i started walking backward down the aisle when i heard and thought i saw in the strange fenestration of that light— a voice first incoherent and then sharp as if it were in my ear there is no reign that executes justice and judgment is that why you whine “ but primo levi ’ s image of a man— a face that haunts every nation on the earth— this this ” don ’ t soak lentils in your mouth “ be serious what ’ s left to praise ” the fig tree drops rocks in the morning and the fig tree drops figs in the morning it ’ s your new yard am i right new house 2 kids and all that “ yup. ” when a santa ana blows fire down the coast do you run to meet it in a leisure suit or with a silicon chip does a squirrel stash nuts of self-pity up its ass what are verses for and the raisin-light dribbling in the clerestory faded and it was cold as i backed down the aisle “ we ’ ll talk more when you ’ re off duty ”
“ since that day till now our life is one unbroken paradise we live a true brotherly life every evening after supper we take a seat under the mighty oak and sing our songs. ” —extract from a letter of a russian refugee in texas twilight is here soft breezes bow the grass day 's sounds of various toil break slowly off the yoke-freed oxen low the patient ass dips his dry nostril in the cool deep trough up from the prairie the tanned herdsmen pass with frothy pails guiding with voices rough their udder-lightened kine fresh smells of earth the rich black furrows of the glebe send forth after the southern day of heavy toil how good to lie with limbs relaxed brows bare to evening 's fan and watch the smoke-wreaths coil up from one 's pipe-stem through the rayless air so deem these unused tillers of the soil who stretched beneath the shadowing oak tree stare peacefully on the star-unfolding skies and name their life unbroken paradise the hounded stag that has escaped the pack and pants at ease within a thick-leaved dell the unimprisoned bird that finds the track through sun-bathed space to where his fellows dwell the martyr granted respite from the rack the death-doomed victim pardoned from his cell — such only know the joy these exiles gain — life 's sharpest rapture is surcease of pain strange faces theirs wherethrough the orient sun gleams from the eyes and glows athwart the skin grave lines of studious thought and purpose run from curl-crowned forehead to dark-bearded chin and over all the seal is stamped thereon of anguish branded by a world of sin in fire and blood through ages on their name their seal of glory and the gentiles shame freedom to love the law that moses brought to sing the songs of david and to think the thoughts gabirol to spinoza taught freedom to dig the common earth to drink the universal air—for this they sought refuge o'er wave and continent to link egypt with texas in their mystic chain and truth 's perpetual lamp forbid to wane hark through the quiet evening air their song floats forth with wild sweet rhythm and glad refrain they sing the conquest of the spirit strong the soul that wrests the victory from pain the noble joys of manhood that belong to comrades and to brothers in their strain rustle of palms and eastern streams one hears and the broad prairie melts in mist of tears
xviii in heaven some little blades of grass stood before god “ what did you do ” then all save one of the little blades began eagerly to relate the merits of their lives this one stayed a small way behind ashamed presently god said “ and what did you do ” the little blade answered “ oh my lord “ memory is bitter to me “ for if i did good deeds “ i know not of them. ” then god in all his splendor arose from his throne “ oh best little blade of grass ” he said
1 created purely from glass the saint stands exposing his gifted quite empty hands like a conjurer about to begin a righteous man begging of righteous men 2 in the sun lily-and-gold-coloured filtering the cruder light he has endured a feature for our regard and will keep of worldly purity the stained archetype 3 the scummed pond twitches the great holly-tree emptied and shut blows clear of wasting snow the common puddled substance beneath like a revealed mineral a new earth

unwitting accomplice in the scheme of law she thought to violate man-set as it was and here inconsequential as the sun at midnight drought at flood-time— when she heard a baby in the tall reeds at the river ’ s brink she was nobody ’ s daughter subject of no rule but the one his need for her established as she knelt down to quell his crying with a little tune just seeing him there had taught her how to hum now as then it is the same tune timelessly in time your mother hums as she kneels down beside your little barge of foam smiling to see you smile when she wrings out from the sponge a ragged string of water over the chest and belly the dimpled loins the bud so far from flowering and the foot slick as a fish your hand tries to hold up till it slips back splashing with such mild turbulence that she laughs and you laugh to see her laugh here now as it was then it is still so many years before the blood ’ s smeared over doorposts before the nile clots with the first-born and the women wailing wailing throughout the city here now again is the kingdom of pleasure where they are safe still mother and child from the chartered rod of the fathers and where a father can still pray lord jealous chooser devouring law keep away from them just keep away

human reason is beautiful and invincible no bars no barbed wire no pulping of books no sentence of banishment can prevail against it it establishes the universal ideas in language and guides our hand so we write truth and justice with capital letters lie and oppression with small it puts what should be above things as they are is an enemy of despair and a friend of hope it does not know jew from greek or slave from master giving us the estate of the world to manage it saves austere and transparent phrases from the filthy discord of tortured words it says that everything is new under the sun opens the congealed fist of the past beautiful and very young are philo-sophia and poetry her ally in the service of the good as late as yesterday nature celebrated their birth the news was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo their friendship will be glorious their time has no limit their enemies have delivered themselves to destruction berkeley 1968
but that which most i wonder at which most i did esteem my bliss which most i boast and ever shall enjoy is that within i felt no stain nor spot of sin no darkness then did overshade but all within was pure and bright no guilt did crush nor fear invade but all my soul was full of light a joyful sense and purity is all i can remember the very night to me was bright ’ twas summer in december a serious meditation did employ my soul within which taken up with joy did seem no outward thing to note but fly all objects that do feed the eye while it those very objects did admire and prize and praise and love which in their glory most are hid which presence only doth remove their constant daily presence i rejoicing at did see and that which takes them from the eye of others offer ’ d them to me no inward inclination did i feel to avarice or pride my soul did kneel in admiration all the day no lust nor strife polluted then my infant life no fraud nor anger in me mov ’ d no malice jealousy or spite all that i saw i truly lov ’ d contentment only and delight were in my soul o heav ’ n what bliss did i enjoy and feel what powerful delight did this inspire for this i daily kneel whether it be that nature is so pure and custom only vicious or that sure god did by miracle the guilt remove and make my soul to feel his love so early or that ’ twas one day wherein this happiness i found whose strength and brightness so do ray that still it seems me to surround what ere it is it is a light so endless unto me that i a world of true delight did then and to this day do see that prospect was the gate of heav ’ n that day the ancient light of eden did convey into my soul i was an adam there a little adam in a sphere of joys o there my ravish ’ d sense was entertain ’ d in paradise and had a sight of innocence which was beyond all bound and price an antepast of heaven sure i on the earth did reign within without me all was pure i must become a child again
and the angel israfel whose heart-strings are a lute and who has the sweetest voice of all god ’ s creatures —koran in heaven a spirit doth dwell “ whose heart-strings are a lute ” none sing so wildly well as the angel israfel and the giddy stars so legends tell ceasing their hymns attend the spell of his voice all mute tottering above in her highest noon the enamoured moon blushes with love while to listen the red levin with the rapid pleiads even which were seven pauses in heaven and they say the starry choir and the other listening things that israfeli ’ s fire is owing to that lyre by which he sits and sings— the trembling living wire of those unusual strings but the skies that angel trod where deep thoughts are a duty where love ’ s a grown-up god where the houri glances are imbued with all the beauty which we worship in a star therefore thou art not wrong israfeli who despisest an unimpassioned song to thee the laurels belong best bard because the wisest merrily live and long the ecstasies above with thy burning measures suit— thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love with the fervour of thy lute— well may the stars be mute yes heaven is thine but this is a world of sweets and sours our flowers are merely—flowers and the shadow of thy perfect bliss is the sunshine of ours if i could dwell where israfel hath dwelt and he where i he might not sing so wildly well a mortal melody while a bolder note than this might swell from my lyre within the sky

talk about politics or dreams or nothing he just said jude next time y ’ all are over in mesopotamia why don ’ t you pick me up a few bottles of that wine they make over there sure thing jesus i says well now the boss is talking he is saying i asked y ’ all up here because frankly i ’ ve been feeling a little sick lately and i want to make sure y ’ all know what to do in case anything happens i know one of you is going to do me in i know that but goddamnit y ’ all know those people in town are after my ass the other night i walked down the streets in a disguise and i seen a couple of you

do it myself wake up jesus philip says paul who hadn ’ t touched a drop gets up and gets his paper out and says the nature of the problem jesus is this the people don ’ t believe you those fellows in the temples have got it all organized all they have to do is send out stooges and hire a couple of rednecks who make out like they ’ re crippled they have a big gathering they say the same things you say they pull off a fake healing the redneck ’ s wife stands up she says lie he ain ’ t lame he ’ s just drunk and so all the people go home saying those christians what a bunch of wind see jesus they are using your material but they ain ’ t coming through so that is making you an enemy of the people we just got to get organized as is proved here today by your followers carrying on as they did so i ’ m getting sold down the river by the elders and their hirelings uh that ’ s right jesus ask anybody here why i didn ’ t think they ’ d do that he says i told you a long time ago not to keep talking

the time for supper and what do we get to eat nothing why can ’ t you have a little faith in us jesus ok this is what we going to do he says hold on who is that walking up the steps it ’ s just judas

nones at three p.m. under sky coming to harm something too red flashes from a limb so red it hurts against sky coming apart against a left-out twice-soaked shirt a cardinal inflames the profane cathedral of suburban yard its owner let fall into disgrace how rain embarrasses the half-pruned hedge the half-mown grass that sports a tonsure in reverse shines under the torture rain slicks with praise red shed red feather crested seedeater out of character where you ’ re neither the strictly monkish brown thrasher nor the odd hermit thrush you scratch in the underbrush of faith to see what you can flush a grub a seed eminence not grise but rouge from your lipsticked beak you pass a sowbug to your mate you peck at a slug sliming your path seeming to beg your forgiveness to what would you confess beyond season-to-season unfaithfulness vespers there are more divine hours a gold-leafed page a mower rows with a scythe as tall as the tower that tents aloft a tiny sky bereft of cloud a chapel ceiling left unstarred heaven a lake turned upside down filled with an emptiness that ’ s clean because it ’ s cold glacial enough to scald the skin it bathed the lungs it filled on devotion ’ s last page deep in the golden age of illumination the hunt ’ s cortège has halted at the edge of the known world a clearing wedged in a forest of spears red bird the badge on the huntsman ’ s tunic you ’ re the splash of crimson lake the distant lordship ’ s flag the cleric dog ’ s bright collar its heretic tongue it slavers on the bleeding stag snarling at prayer that chases belief it licks the offal of grief the heart cast aside reward enough
let me not thirst with this hock at my lip nor beg with domains in my pocket—
let me tell you about my marvelous god how he hides in the hexagons of the bees how the drought that wrings its leather hands above the world is of his making as well as the rain in the quiet minutes that leave only thoughts of rain an atom is working and working an atom is working in deepest night then bursting like the farthest star it is far smaller than a pinprick far smaller than a zero and it has no will no will toward us this is why the heart has paced and paced will pace and pace across the field where yarrow was and now is dust a leaf catches in a bone the burrow ’ s shut by a tumbled clod and the roots upturned are hot to the touch how my god is a feathered and whirling thing you will singe your arm when you pluck him from the air when you pluck him from that sky where grieving swirls and you will burn again throwing him back
down the street someone must be praying and though i don ’ t go there anymore i want to at times to hear the diction and the tone though the english pronoun for god is obsolete— what goes on is devotion which wouldn ’ t change if i heard the polished sermon the upright ’ s arpeggios of vacant notes what else could unite widows bankers children and ghosts and those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward to the rostrum that represents law and the minister who represents god beams like the white palm of the good hand of christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude which i am not among though i feel the abundance of calm and know the beatitude so well i do not have to imagine it or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat or the ritual linen of sunday tables that are already set more than any other days sundays stand in unvarying rows that beg attention there is that studied verisimilitude of sanctuary so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up for some eye in the distant past some remote kingdom where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers that is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead but returned to prior things a vista of angels and sheep a desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree hushed stores all day that sense a bell is about to ring— i recognized it waking up before i weighed the bulk of news or saw saturday night ’ s cars parked randomly along the curb and though i had no prayer i wanted to offer something or ask for something perhaps out of habit but as the past must always be honored unconsciously formally and persists on this first and singular day though i think of it as last
1 dear milton rain but when you are here alone what does it mean it means psalm — that song sung to the harp like trees we too hold on to the earth — pull and twang for another tongue it whatever it is and who knows that is a sacred song it is strange for we are the ones who glorify mystery with our arms we call it testament because it pries at our souls with many branches and so you say with a huge eye we must practice our art like the third stomach of a cud-chewing animal “ myrtle woodbine appletrees trillium here they are the strength of your arm stalls at the open gate of the stars feel everything trust everything ” we are always limited to what we ask for so why not ask for wings therefore desire becomes a flight marker for surely we hover over what we have done as though we have wings — looking for signs that will tell us where to go and if we have gone somewhere what it means milton like david of old like david of old or any child we live on the tip of that lean tongue of invocation with our sling saying “ i am small in this bright cataract of pine i stand on the smallest stone i am a standing prairie dog praying for my song. ” and so we have come to know what is sacred is the storm how the winds shimmer in the pool how “ brushes are frightened. ” milton it is right to say “ i ’ m lucky i ’ m always lucky. ” for though “ now somewhere as if i were really holy i know that my savior is lonely. ” you also know “ the wind has given me its child to hold — riding on my shoulders with its stars. ” of course i ’ m biased what ’ s a friend for but i think you have done what you should have done — gone to the fountainhead and glorified in psalm it may please you to know that out there rain too gives in large quantities love to family 2 dear love to family “ o mother momma how can i eat this my teeth are in my grave my promises broken. ” on that anvil called home we beat out family it is enough and lovely to learn from our own to say “ grandma celia ” to say “ davey davey paula my paula. ” on that anvil called home we are like van gogh — thinking always in vivid colors that are both silent and raging for without it we would have no capac- ity for peace — or war we would be unable to settle or plan or to love and fear tales this is the center that allows us to pass among people — the beautiful black night with all the stars 3 dear beautiful black night with all the stars swimming in the pool it occurs to you “ i am no one else. ” in this context completely surrounded every- thing must live 4 dear everything must live no country no culture no person can give us more than the “ rant of the ordinary life. ” 5 dear rant of the ordinary life what we hand to our children is our truth as large as we are it is small fragile in a bed you learn about infirmity ’ s strong arms “ what is it who ’ s there ” your heart is the real house you breathe in old love ’ s fantasy is there it has young feet “ it is strange i want to weep. ” we are never at peace because all our work comes back it spies on us as round as the moon “ boy look at the moon look at that moon it looks like it ’ s right on top of us. ” 6 dear right on top of us around us life and death someone born like us — gone blackburn like a magician ’ s stroke of the wand — gone on a freighter you stare into the water and go to your ancestral home you think about small selma all the occupied zones we are how our fingertips are almost like birds once when you were a boy you let go of the fence you are still falling 7 dear you are still falling you are a cantor whose strange songs absorb mystery and that is not sailing too far so long p
—once more the poem woke me up the dark poem i was ready for it he was sleeping and across the cabin the small furnace lit and re-lit itself—the flame a yellow “ tongue ” again the metal benignly hard again and a thousand insects outside called and made me nothing moonlight streamed inside as if it had been ... i looked around i thought of the lower wisdom spirit held by matter mary white as a sand dollar and christ his sticky halo tilted— oh to get behind it the world had been created to comprehend itself as matter table the torn veils of spiders ... even consciousness— missing my love— was matter the metal box of a furnace as the obligated flame so burned my life ... what is the meaning of this suffering i asked and the voice—not christ but between us— said you are the meaning no no i replied that is the shape what is the meaning you are the meaning it said—
i know a little language of my cat though dante says that animals have no need of speech and nature abhors the superfluous my cat is fluent he converses when he wants with me to speak is natural and whales and wolves i ’ ve heard in choral soundings of the sea and air know harmony and have an eloquence that stirs my mind and heart—they touch the soul here dante ’ s religion that would set man apart damns the effluence of our life from us to build therein its powerhouse it ’ s in his animal communication man is true immediate and in immediacy man is all animal his senses quicken in the thick of the symphony old circuits of animal rapture and alarm attentions and arousals in which an identity rearrives he hears particular voices among the concert the slightest rustle in the undertones rehearsing a nervous aptitude yet to prove his he sees the flick of significant red within the rushing mass of ruddy wilderness and catches the glow of a green shirt to delite him in a glowing field of green —it speaks to him— and in the arc of the spectrum color speaks to color the rainbow articulates a promise he remembers he but imitates in noises that he makes this speech in every sense the world surrounding him he picks up on the fugitive tang of mace amidst the savory mass and taste in evolution is an everlasting key there is a pun of scents in what makes sense myrrh it may have been the odor of the announcement that filld the house he wakes from deepest sleep upon a distant signal and waits as if crouching springs to life
a courtier speaks to ch ’ in shih-huang-ti ca 210 b.c highness the former walls were helpless they stood alone in the middle of small fields protecting nothing a single peasant ’ s holding engulfed each one as it ran briefly straight from noplace off to noplace with ruinous steps of broken stone at both ends only head-high without the towers gates and towns of your great wall they stuck where they were never rising over hills or curving through valleys nothing but shoddy masonry and a mystery who built them how long ago what for they seemed to have no role but balking the reaper and the ox their bases made islands in the flashing scythe-strokes where wild flowers and shrubs sprouted so all the people praise you for burying such walls and their memory in your vast one which joins them stretching far beyond where they once crumbled to hold your empire a wall which therefore can never have an end but has to go on extending itself forever how useful how cogent your wall is a pale for the civilized a dike against the wild people outside who trade their quiet human blood for the rage of gods tearing men to pieces throwing them watching them fall in burying those little walls lord you have covered our shame at our ancestors best forgotten whose mighty works were so pointless or so pitiably useless was all their effort so that daisies could grow in fissures so that some human work would rise over the flats and weather till it seemed not human only so that something of ours could be like trees and rocks docile-seeming yet sullenly opposed to use and when compelled only half serving reserving from the functions that we give them a secret and idle self the peasants would make lean-tos for cattle against those walls they served for this alone now scholars lord are saying the gods are not bulls and cows that in ancient times we herded these animals to keep from starving and going naked and so came the old custom of thinking them gods—from dependence in my youth i know the peasants said just the opposite worship came first the awesome bull and cow were gathered to be adored more easily till people noticed how they let themselves be driven and penned next came the first murders against these gods and the careful observation that they stood to be killed and so their cult became contempt of beings that would live with us and submit to our crimes and hunger and we began to breed them that is why the farmer says cattle are honoured murdered eaten cherished with labour that makes him their slave and that is why in summer he exults in blood but shivers with fear with exhausted terror and regret and sinks into stunned revelry all winter eating the salted meat getting children his house closed up with snow himself awake as if he slept living as if he had already died and rich happy as if he were a buried worm is god then highness the fat flaccidity of cattle myself i don ’ t like to wonder anymore i only hope lifelong service earns what i ask the command of some far bastion on your wall where it curves out into the unsettled wastes beyond any field and the barrenness inside is indistinguishable from that without this is the reward and end of life i want to be a point though infinitely small and far from you in that wide circle centred on your great self i see myself arriving to take charge of my troops i look down from the tower bare plains outcrops of ice and rock vast restless stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined overcast the cold wind ’ s hissing year after year the same waiting for an assault that never comes straining to glimpse our naked enemies creeping blended with their stony soil nothing but legend it may be maybe a morning will rise when waking i find that i ’ ve forgotten which way is north and can ’ t tell if i am turned outward to danger or inward highness to you the sun invisible a murky light diffused throughout featureless cloud and the wall so long no curve appears—it seems to stretch out straight endlessly east and west what clue will there be which way to face my people for the attack it will be crucial then to show no doubt my orders i vow though ignorant will be crisp

not for their ice-pick eyes their weeping willow hair and their clenched fists beating at heaven not for their warnings predictions of doom but what they promised i don ’ t care if their beards are mildewed and the ladders are broken let them go on picking the wormy fruit let the one with the yoke around his neck climb out of the cistern let them come down from the heights in their radiant despair like the sankei juko dancers descending on ropes down from these hills to the earth of their first existence let them follow the track we ’ ve cut on the sides of mountains into the desert and stumble again through the great rift littered with bones and the walls of cities let them sift through the ashes with their burned hands let them tell us what will come after
the eyes open to a cry of pulleys and spirited from sleep the astounded soul hangs for a moment bodiless and simple as false dawn outside the open window the morning air is all awash with angels some are in bed-sheets some are in blouses some are in smocks but truly there they are now they are rising together in calm swells of halcyon feeling filling whatever they wear with the deep joy of their impersonal breathing now they are flying in place conveying the terrible speed of their omnipresence moving and staying like white water and now of a sudden they swoon down into so rapt a quiet that nobody seems to be there the soul shrinks from all that it is about to remember from the punctual rape of every blessèd day and cries “ oh let there be nothing on earth but laundry nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam and clear dances done in the sight of heaven. ” yet as the sun acknowledges with a warm look the world ’ s hunks and colors the soul descends once more in bitter love to accept the waking body saying now in a changed voice as the man yawns and rises “ bring them down from their ruddy gallows let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone and the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating of dark habits keeping their difficult balance ”

for desiray kierra chee in the last days of the fourth world i wished to make a map for those who would climb through the hole in the sky my only tools were the desires of humans as they emerged from the killing fields from the bedrooms and the kitchens for the soul is a wanderer with many hands and feet the map must be of sand and can ’ t be read by ordinary light it must carry fire to the next tribal town for renewal of spirit in the legend are instructions on the language of the land how it was we forgot to acknowledge the gift as if we were not in it or of it take note of the proliferation of supermarkets and malls the altars of money they best describe the detour from grace keep track of the errors of our forgetfulness the fog steals our children while we sleep flowers of rage spring up in the depression monsters are born there of nuclear anger trees of ashes wave good-bye to good-bye and the map appears to disappear we no longer know the names of the birds here how to speak to them by their personal names once we knew everything in this lush promise what i am telling you is real and is printed in a warning on the map our forgetfulness stalks us walks the earth behind us leav- ing a trail of paper diapers needles and wasted blood an imperfect map will have to do little one the place of entry is the sea of your mother ’ s blood your father ’ s small death as he longs to know himself in another there is no exit the map can be interpreted through the wall of the intestine—a spiral on the road of knowledge you will travel through the membrane of death smell cooking from the encampment where our relatives make a feast of fresh deer meat and corn soup in the milky way they have never left us we abandoned them for science and when you take your next breath as we enter the fifth world there will be no x no guidebook with words you can carry you will have to navigate by your mother ’ s voice renew the song she is singing fresh courage glimmers from planets and lights the map printed with the blood of history a map you will have to know by your intention by the language of suns when you emerge note the tracks of the monster slayers where they entered the cities of artificial light and killed what was killing us you will see red cliffs they are the heart contain the ladder a white deer will greet you when the last human climbs from the destruction remember the hole of shame marking the act of abandoning our tribal grounds we were never perfect yet the journey we make together is perfect on this earth who was once a star and made the same mistakes as humans we might make them again she said crucial to finding the way is this there is no beginning or end you must make your own map

1. the dark socket of the year the pit the cave where the sun lies down and threatens never to rise when despair descends softly as the snow covering all paths and choking roads then hawkfaced pain seized you threw you so you fell with a sharp cry a knife tearing a bolt of silk my father heard the crash but paid no mind napping after lunch yet fifteen hundred miles north i heard and dropped a dish your pain sunk talons in my skull and crouched there cawing heavy as a great vessel filled with water oil or blood till suddenly next day the weight lifted and i knew your mind had guttered out like the chanukah candles that burn so fast weeping veils of wax down the chanukiya those candles were laid out friends invited ingredients bought for latkes and apple pancakes that holiday for liberation and the winter solstice when tops turn like little planets shall you have all or nothing take half or pass by untouched nothing you got nun said the dreydl as the room stopped spinning the angel folded you up like laundry your body thin as an empty dress your clothes were curtains hanging on the window of what had been your flesh and now was glass outside in florida shopping plazas loudspeakers blared christmas carols and palm trees were decked with blinking lights except by the tourist hotels the beaches were empty pelicans with pregnant pouches flapped overhead like pterodactyls in my mind i felt you die first the pain lifted and then you flickered and went out 2. i walk through the rooms of memory sometimes everything is shrouded in dropcloths every chair ghostly and muted other times memory lights up from within bustling scenes acted just the other side of a scrim through which surely i could reach my fingers tearing at the flimsy curtain of time which is and isn ’ t and will be the stuff of which we ’ re made and unmade in sleep the other night i met you seventeen your first nasty marriage just annulled thin from your abortion clutching a book against your cheek and trying to look older trying to look middle class trying for a job at wanamaker ’ s dressing for parties in cast off stage costumes of your sisters your eyes were hazy with dreams you did not notice me waving as you wandered past and i saw your slip was showing you stood still while i fixed your clothes as if i were your mother remember me combing your springy black hair ringlets that seemed metallic glittering remember me dressing you my seventy year old mother who was my last dollbaby giving you too late what your youth had wanted 3. what is this mask of skin we wear what is this dress of flesh this coat of few colors and little hair this voluptuous seething heap of desires and fears squeaking mice turned up in a steaming haystack with their babies this coat has been handed down an heirloom this coat of black hair and ample flesh this coat of pale slightly ruddy skin this set of hips and thighs these buttocks they provided cushioning for my grandmother hannah for my mother bert and for me and we all sat on them in turn those major muscles on which we walk and walk and walk over the earth in search of peace and plenty my mother is my mirror and i am hers what do we see our face grown young again our breasts grown firm legs lean and elegant our arms quivering with fat eyes set in the bark of wrinkles hands puffy our belly seamed with childbearing give me your dress that i might try it on oh it will not fit you mother you are too fat i will not fit you mother i will not be the bride you can dress the obedient dutiful daughter you would chew a dog ’ s leather bone to sharpen your teeth you strike me sometimes just to hear the sound loneliness turns your fingers into hooks barbed and drawing blood with their caress my twin my sister my lost love i carry you in me like an embryo as once you carried me 4. what is it we turn from what is it we fear did i truly think you could put me back inside did i think i would fall into you as into a molten furnace and be recast that i would become you what did you fear in me the child who wore your hair the woman who let that black hair grow long as a banner of darkness when you a proper flapper wore yours cropped you pushed and you pulled on my rubbery flesh you kneaded me like a ball of dough rise rise and then you pounded me flat secretly the bones formed in the bread i became willful private as a cat you never knew what alleys i had wandered you called me bad and i posed like a gutter queen in a dress sewn of knives all i feared was being stuck in a box with a lid a good woman appeared to me indistinguishable from a dead one except that she worked all the time your payday never came your dreams ran with bright colors like mexican cottons that bled onto the drab sheets of the day and would not bleach with scrubbing my dear what you said was one thing but what you sang was another sweetly subversive and dark as blackberries and i became the daughter of your dream this body is your body ashes now and roses but alive in my eyes my breasts my throat my thighs you run in me a tang of salt in the creek waters of my blood you sing in my mind like wine what you did not dare in your life you dare in mine

i omen what was going on in the new york american black/red/green helmeted neon night the elevator door was closing behind us we were the ones plunging floor after floor after floor after floor to the abyss—but it was someone else ’ s face staring from the screen out at us someone else ’ s face saying something flashing from the teleprompter though what the face said was meant to reassure down in the abyss the footage kept playing all of it looping back like children chanting the answers to nonsensical riddles taunting a classmate who doesn ’ t know the question “ because it ’ s too far to walk ” “ time to get a new fence ” “ a big red rock eater. ” and as the images rewound and the face kept talking the clear night sky filled up with smoke and the smoke kept puring itself out into the

eats rocks ” 2 in front of st. vincent ’ s a woman hugging another woman who was weeping blocked the sidewalk nobody moved for a moment they were an island caught at the tide turning such misery in two human bodies then the wearing away of the crowd moving flowed over them and they were pulled swiftly along down the sidewalk 3 joke faces powdered with dust and ash there they were in the fast food place raucous and wild splitting the seams of their work clothes weary to hysteria as they hunched in their booth next to the buffet under heat lamps reflecting incarnadine off pastas and vegetable slag then the joke ignited they quivered on the launch pad laughter closed around them they couldn ’ t breathe it was as if they were staring out from a space capsule porthole and were asking the void an imponderable riddle while orbiting so high up in space that the earth was less than the least hint of light piercing the smoke-filled cloudless night what was the joke about nobody knew and then they stopped laughing and stared into their plates ash smearing down their faces as they chewed 4 spell spoken by suppliant to helios for knowledge from the greek magical papyri under my

at this hour the soul floats weightlessly through the city streets speechless and invisible astonished by the smoky blend of grays and golds seeping out of the air the dark half-tones of dusk suddenly filling the urban sky while the body sits listlessly by the window sullen and heavy too exhausted to move too weary to stand up or to lie down at this hour the soul is like a yellow wing slipping through the treetops a little ecstatic cloud hovering over the sidewalks calling out to the approaching night “ amaze me amaze me ” while the body sits glumly by the window listening to the clear summons of the dead transparent as glass clairvoyant as crystal some nights it is almost ready to join them oh this is a strange unlikely tethering a furious grafting of the quick and the slow when the soul flies up the body sinks down and all night—locked in the same cramped room— they go on quarreling stubbornly threatening to leave each other wordlessly filling the air with the sound of a low internal burning how long can this bewildering marriage last at midnight the soul dreams of a small fire of stars flaming on the other side of the sky but the body stares into an empty night sheen a hollow-eyed darkness poor luckless angels feverish old loves don ’ t separate yet let what rises live with what descends

headlong and break on our atlantic wall off ’ sconset where the yawing s-boats splash the bellbuoy with ballooning spinnakers as the entangled screeching mainsheet clears the blocks off madaket where lubbers lash the heavy surf and throw their long lead squids for blue-fish sea-gulls blink their heavy lids seaward the winds ’ wings beat upon the stones cousin and scream for you and the claws rush

all around the altar huge lianas curled unfurled the dark green of their leaves to complement the red of blood spilled there—a kind of christmas decoration overhung with heavy vines and over them the stars when the angels came messengers like birds but with the oiled flesh of men they hung over the scene with smoldering swords splashing the world when they beat their rain-soaked wings against the turning sky the child was bright in his basket as a lemon with a bitter smell from his wet swaddling clothes his mother bent above him singing a lullaby in the liquid tongue invented for the very young—short syllables like dripping from an eave mixed with the first big drops of rain that fell like tiny silver pears from the glistening fronds of palm the three who gathered there—old kings uncrowned the cockroach condor and the leopard lords of the cracks below the ground the mountain pass and the grass-grown plain—were not adorned did not bear gifts had not come to adore they were simply drawn to gawk at this recurrent awkward son whom the wind had said would spell the end of earth as it had been somewhere north of this familiar scene the polar caps were melting the water was advancing in its slow relentless lines swallowing the old landmarks swelling the seas that pulled the flowers and the great steel cities down the dolphins sport in the rising sea anemones wave their many arms like hair on a drowned gorgon ’ s head her features softened by the sea beyond all recognition on the desert ’ s edge where the oasis dies in a wash of sand the sphinx seems to shift on her haunches of stone and the rain as it runs down completes the ruin of her face the nile merges with the sea the waters rise and drown the noise of earth at the forest ’ s edge where the child sleeps the waters gather— as if a hand were reaching for the curtain to drop across the glowing lit tableau when the waves closed over completing the green sweep of ocean there was no time for mourning no final trump no thunder to announce the silent steal of waters how soundlessly it all went under the little family and the scene so easily mistaken for an adoration above more clouds poured in and closed their ranks across the skies the angels who had seemed so solid turned quicksilver in the rain now nothing but the wind moves on the rain-pocked face of the swollen waters though far below where giant squid lie hidden in shy tangles the whales heavy-bodied as the angels their fins like vestiges of wings sing some mighty epic of their own— a great day when the ships would all withdraw the harpoons fail of their aim the land dissolve into the waters and they would swim among the peaks of mountains like eagles of the deep while far below them the old nightmares of earth would settle into silt among the broken cities the empty basket of the child would float abandoned in the seaweed until the work of water unraveled it in filaments of straw till even that straw rotted in the planetary thaw the whales prayed for sending their jets of water skyward in the clear conviction they ’ d spill back to ocean with their will accomplished in the miracle of rain and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit moved upon the face of the waters

after reading ash wednesday she looked once at the baked beans and fled luncheonless poor girl she observed a kind of poetic lent— and i had thought i liked poetry better than she did i do but to me its most endearing quality is its unsuitableness and conversely the chief wonder in heaven whither i also am sometimes transported is the kind of baggage i bring with me surely there is no more exquisite jointure in the anatomy of life than that at which poetry dovetails with the inevitable meal and mrs. b. sits murmuring of avocados
happy those early days when i shined in my angel infancy before i understood this place appointed for my second race or taught my soul to fancy aught but a white celestial thought when yet i had not walked above a mile or two from my first love and looking back at that short space could see a glimpse of his bright face when on some gilded cloud or flower my gazing soul would dwell an hour and in those weaker glories spy some shadows of eternity before i taught my tongue to wound my conscience with a sinful sound or had the black art to dispense a several sin to every sense but felt through all this fleshly dress bright shoots of everlastingness o how i long to travel back and tread again that ancient track that i might once more reach that plain where first i left my glorious train from whence th ’ enlightened spirit sees that shady city of palm trees but ah my soul with too much stay is drunk and staggers in the way some men a forward motion love but i by backward steps would move and when this dust falls to the urn in that state i came return

argument how a ship having passed the line was driven by storms to the cold country towards the south pole and how from thence she made her course to the tropical latitude of the great pacific ocean and of the strange things that befell and in what manner the ancyent marinere came back to his own country part i it is an ancient mariner and he stoppeth one of three 'by thy long grey beard and glittering eye now wherefore stopp'st thou me the bridegroom 's doors are opened wide and i am next of kin the guests are met the feast is set may'st hear the merry din he holds him with his skinny hand 'there was a ship quoth he 'hold off unhand me grey-beard loon eftsoons his hand dropt he he holds him with his glittering eye— the wedding-guest stood still and listens like a three years child the mariner hath his will the wedding-guest sat on a stone he can not choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the bright-eyed mariner 'the ship was cheered the harbour cleared merrily did we drop below the kirk below the hill below the lighthouse top the sun came up upon the left out of the sea came he and he shone bright and on the right went down into the sea higher and higher every day till over the mast at noon—' the wedding-guest here beat his breast for he heard the loud bassoon the bride hath paced into the hall red as a rose is she nodding their heads before her goes the merry minstrelsy the wedding-guest he beat his breast yet he can not choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the bright-eyed mariner and now the storm-blast came and he was tyrannous and strong he struck with his o'ertaking wings and chased us south along with sloping masts and dipping prow as who pursued with yell and blow still treads the shadow of his foe and forward bends his head the ship drove fast loud roared the blast and southward aye we fled and now there came both mist and snow and it grew wondrous cold and ice mast-high came floating by as green as emerald and through the drifts the snowy clifts did send a dismal sheen nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken— the ice was all between the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it cracked and growled and roared and howled like noises in a swound at length did cross an albatross thorough the fog it came as if it had been a christian soul we hailed it in god 's name it ate the food it ne'er had eat and round and round it flew the ice did split with a thunder-fit the helmsman steered us through and a good south wind sprung up behind the albatross did follow and every day for food or play came to the mariner 's hollo in mist or cloud on mast or shroud it perched for vespers nine whiles all the night through fog-smoke white glimmered the white moon-shine 'god save thee ancient mariner from the fiends that plague thee thus — why look'st thou so '—with my cross-bow i shot the albatross part ii the sun now rose upon the right out of the sea came he still hid in mist and on the left went down into the sea and the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for food or play came to the mariner 's hollo and i had done a hellish thing and it would work 'em woe for all averred i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow ah wretch said they the bird to slay that made the breeze to blow nor dim nor red like god 's own head the glorious sun uprist then all averred i had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist 't was right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist the fair breeze blew the white foam flew the furrow followed free we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down 'twas sad as sad could be and we did speak only to break the silence of the sea all in a hot and copper sky the bloody sun at noon right up above the mast did stand no bigger than the moon day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean water water every where and all the boards did shrink water water every where nor any drop to drink the very deep did rot o christ that ever this should be yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea about about in reel and rout the death-fires danced at night the water like a witch 's oils burnt green and blue and white and some in dreams assurèd were of the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow and every tongue through utter drought was withered at the root we could not speak no more than if we had been choked with soot ah well a-day what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung part iii there passed a weary time each throat was parched and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye when looking westward i beheld a something in the sky at first it seemed a little speck and then it seemed a mist it moved and moved and took at last a certain shape i wist a speck a mist a shape i wist and still it neared and neared as if it dodged a water-sprite it plunged and tacked and veered with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could nor laugh nor wail through utter drought all dumb we stood i bit my arm i sucked the blood and cried a sail a sail with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us weal without a breeze without a tide she steadies with upright keel the western wave was all a-flame the day was well nigh done almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun and straight the sun was flecked with bars heaven 's mother send us grace as if through a dungeon-grate he peered with broad and burning face alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossameres are those her ribs through which the sun did peer as through a grate and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that woman 's mate her lips were red her looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the night-mare life-in-death was she who thicks man 's blood with cold the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice 'the game is done i 've won i 've won quoth she and whistles thrice the sun 's rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with far-heard whisper o'er the sea off shot the spectre-bark we listened and looked sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my life-blood seemed to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the steersman 's face by his lamp gleamed white from the sails the dew did drip— till clomb above the eastern bar the hornèd moon with one bright star within the nether tip one after one by the star-dogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye four times fifty living men and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one the souls did from their bodies fly — they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my cross-bow part iv 'i fear thee ancient mariner i fear thy skinny hand and thou art long and lank and brown as is the ribbed sea-sand i fear thee and thy glittering eye and thy skinny hand so brown '— fear not fear not thou wedding-guest this body dropt not down alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i. i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and made my heart as dry as dust i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay dead like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked on me had never passed away an orphan 's curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than that is the curse in a dead man 's eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die the moving moon went up the sky and no where did abide softly she was going up and a star or two beside— her beams bemocked the sultry main like april hoar-frost spread but where the ship 's huge shadow lay the charmèd water burnt alway a still and awful red beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the water-snakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam and every track was a flash of golden fire o happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware the self-same moment i could pray and from my neck so free the albatross fell off and sank like lead into the sea part v oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole to mary queen the praise be given she sent the gentle sleep from heaven that slid into my soul the silly buckets on the deck that had so long remained i dreamt that they were filled with dew and when i awoke it rained my lips were wet my throat was cold my garments all were dank sure i had drunken in my dreams and still my body drank i moved and could not feel my limbs i was so light—almost i thought that i had died in sleep and was a blessed ghost and soon i heard a roaring wind it did not come anear but with its sound it shook the sails that were so thin and sere the upper air burst into life and a hundred fire-flags sheen to and fro they were hurried about and to and fro and in and out the wan stars danced between and the coming wind did roar more loud and the sails did sigh like sedge and the rain poured down from one black cloud the moon was at its edge the thick black cloud was cleft and still the moon was at its side like waters shot from some high crag the lightning fell with never a jag a river steep and wide the loud wind never reached the ship yet now the ship moved on beneath the lightning and the moon the dead men gave a groan they groaned they stirred they all uprose nor spake nor moved their eyes it had been strange even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise the helmsman steered the ship moved on yet never a breeze up-blew the mariners all 'gan work the ropes where they were wont to do they raised their limbs like lifeless tools— we were a ghastly crew the body of my brother 's son stood by me knee to knee the body and i pulled at one rope but he said nought to me 'i fear thee ancient mariner be calm thou wedding-guest 't was not those souls that fled in pain which to their corses came again but a troop of spirits blest for when it dawned—they dropped their arms and clustered round the mast sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths and from their bodies passed around around flew each sweet sound then darted to the sun slowly the sounds came back again now mixed now one by one sometimes a-dropping from the sky i heard the sky-lark sing sometimes all little birds that are how they seemed to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargoning and now 't was like all instruments now like a lonely flute and now it is an angel 's song that makes the heavens be mute it ceased yet still the sails made on a pleasant noise till noon a noise like of a hidden brook in the leafy month of june that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune till noon we quietly sailed on yet never a breeze did breathe slowly and smoothly went the ship moved onward from beneath under the keel nine fathom deep from the land of mist and snow the spirit slid and it was he that made the ship to go the sails at noon left off their tune and the ship stood still also the sun right up above the mast had fixed her to the ocean but in a minute she 'gan stir with a short uneasy motion— backwards and forwards half her length with a short uneasy motion then like a pawing horse let go she made a sudden bound it flung the blood into my head and i fell down in a swound how long in that same fit i lay i have not to declare but ere my living life returned i heard and in my soul discerned two voices in the air 'is it he quoth one 'is this the man by him who died on cross with his cruel bow he laid full low the harmless albatross the spirit who bideth by himself in the land of mist and snow he loved the bird that loved the man who shot him with his bow the other was a softer voice as soft as honey-dew quoth he 'the man hath penance done and penance more will do part vi first voice 'but tell me tell me speak again thy soft response renewing— what makes that ship drive on so fast what is the ocean doing second voice still as a slave before his lord the ocean hath no blast his great bright eye most silently up to the moon is cast— if he may know which way to go for she guides him smooth or grim see brother see how graciously she looketh down on him first voice 'but why drives on that ship so fast without or wave or wind second voice 'the air is cut away before and closes from behind fly brother fly more high more high or we shall be belated for slow and slow that ship will go when the mariner 's trance is abated i woke and we were sailing on as in a gentle weather 'twas night calm night the moon was high the dead men stood together all stood together on the deck for a charnel-dungeon fitter all fixed on me their stony eyes that in the moon did glitter the pang the curse with which they died had never passed away i could not draw my eyes from theirs nor turn them up to pray and now this spell was snapt once more i viewed the ocean green and looked far forth yet little saw of what had else been seen— like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread but soon there breathed a wind on me nor sound nor motion made its path was not upon the sea in ripple or in shade it raised my hair it fanned my cheek like a meadow-gale of spring— it mingled strangely with my fears yet it felt like a welcoming swiftly swiftly flew the ship yet she sailed softly too sweetly sweetly blew the breeze— on me alone it blew oh dream of joy is this indeed the light-house top i see is this the hill is this the kirk is this mine own countree we drifted o'er the harbour-bar and i with sobs did pray— o let me be awake my god or let me sleep alway the harbour-bay was clear as glass so smoothly it was strewn and on the bay the moonlight lay and the shadow of the moon the rock shone bright the kirk no less that stands above the rock the moonlight steeped in silentness the steady weathercock and the bay was white with silent light till rising from the same full many shapes that shadows were in crimson colours came a little distance from the prow those crimson shadows were i turned my eyes upon the deck— oh christ what saw i there each corse lay flat lifeless and flat and by the holy rood a man all light a seraph-man on every corse there stood this seraph-band each waved his hand it was a heavenly sight they stood as signals to the land each one a lovely light this seraph-band each waved his hand no voice did they impart— no voice but oh the silence sank like music on my heart but soon i heard the dash of oars i heard the pilot 's cheer my head was turned perforce away and i saw a boat appear the pilot and the pilot 's boy i heard them coming fast dear lord in heaven it was a joy the dead men could not blast i saw a third—i heard his voice it is the hermit good he singeth loud his godly hymns that he makes in the wood he 'll shrieve my soul he 'll wash away the albatross 's blood part vii this hermit good lives in that wood which slopes down to the sea how loudly his sweet voice he rears he loves to talk with marineres that come from a far countree he kneels at morn and noon and eve— he hath a cushion plump it is the moss that wholly hides the rotted old oak-stump the skiff-boat neared i heard them talk 'why this is strange i trow where are those lights so many and fair that signal made but now 'strange by my faith the hermit said— 'and they answered not our cheer the planks looked warped and see those sails how thin they are and sere i never saw aught like to them unless perchance it were brown skeletons of leaves that lag my forest-brook along when the ivy-tod is heavy with snow and the owlet whoops to the wolf below that eats the she-wolf 's young 'dear lord it hath a fiendish look— the pilot made reply i am a-feared'—'push on push on said the hermit cheerily the boat came closer to the ship but i nor spake nor stirred the boat came close beneath the ship and straight a sound was heard under the water it rumbled on still louder and more dread it reached the ship it split the bay the ship went down like lead stunned by that loud and dreadful sound which sky and ocean smote like one that hath been seven days drowned my body lay afloat but swift as dreams myself i found within the pilot 's boat upon the whirl where sank the ship the boat spun round and round and all was still save that the hill was telling of the sound i moved my lips—the pilot shrieked and fell down in a fit the holy hermit raised his eyes and prayed where he did sit i took the oars the pilot 's boy who now doth crazy go laughed loud and long and all the while his eyes went to and fro 'ha ha quoth he 'full plain i see the devil knows how to row and now all in my own countree i stood on the firm land the hermit stepped forth from the boat and scarcely he could stand 'o shrieve me shrieve me holy man the hermit crossed his brow 'say quick quoth he 'i bid thee say— what manner of man art thou forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched with a woful agony which forced me to begin my tale and then it left me free since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns i pass like night from land to land i have strange power of speech that moment that his face i see i know the man that must hear me to him my tale i teach what loud uproar bursts from that door the wedding-guests are there but in the garden-bower the bride and bride-maids singing are and hark the little vesper bell which biddeth me to prayer o wedding-guest this soul hath been alone on a wide wide sea so lonely 't was that god himself scarce seemèd there to be o sweeter than the marriage-feast 'tis sweeter far to me to walk together to the kirk with a goodly company — to walk together to the kirk and all together pray while each to his great father bends old men and babes and loving friends and youths and maidens gay farewell farewell but this i tell to thee thou wedding-guest he prayeth well who loveth well both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all the mariner whose eye is

at four o ’ clock in the gun-metal blue dark we hear the first crow of the first cock just below the gun-metal blue window and immediately there is an echo off in the distance then one from the backyard fence then one with horrible insistence grates like a wet match from the broccoli patch flares and all over town begins to catch cries galore come from the water-closet door from the dropping-plastered henhouse floor where in the blue blur their rustling wives admire the roosters brace their cruel feet and glare with stupid eyes while from their beaks there rise the uncontrolled traditional cries deep from protruding chests in green-gold medals dressed planned to command and terrorize the rest the many wives who lead hens ’ lives of being courted and despised deep from raw throats a senseless order floats all over town a rooster gloats over our beds from rusty iron sheds and fences made from old bedsteads over our churches where the tin rooster perches over our little wooden northern houses making sallies from all the muddy alleys marking out maps like rand mcnally ’ s glass-headed pins oil-golds and copper greens anthracite blues alizarins each one an active displacement in perspective each screaming “ this is where i live ” each screaming “ get up stop dreaming ” roosters what are you projecting you whom the greeks elected to shoot at on a post who struggled when sacrificed you whom they labeled “ very combative ... ” what right have you to give commands and tell us how to live cry “ here ” and “ here ” and wake us here where are unwanted love conceit and war the crown of red set on your little head is charged with all your fighting blood yes that excrescence makes a most virile presence plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence now in mid-air by twos they fight each other down comes a first flame-feather and one is flying with raging heroism defying even the sensation of dying and one has fallen but still above the town his torn-out bloodied feathers drift down and what he sung no matter he is flung on the gray ash-heap lies in dung with his dead wives with open bloody eyes while those metallic feathers oxidize st. peter ’ s sin was worse than that of magdalen whose sin was of the flesh alone of spirit peter ’ s falling beneath the flares among the “ servants and officers. ” old holy sculpture could set it all together in one small scene past and future christ stands amazed peter two fingers raised to surprised lips both as if dazed but in between a little cock is seen carved on a dim column in the travertine explained by gallus canit flet petrus underneath it there is inescapable hope the pivot yes and there peter ’ s tears run down our chanticleer ’ s sides and gem his spurs tear-encrusted thick as a medieval relic he waits poor peter heart-sick still can not guess those cock-a-doodles yet might bless his dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness a new weathervane on basilica and barn and that outside the lateran there would always be a bronze cock on a porphyry pillar so the people and the pope might see that even the prince of the apostles long since had been forgiven and to convince all the assembly that “ deny deny deny ” is not all the roosters cry in the morning a low light is floating in the backyard and gilding from underneath the broccoli leaf by leaf how could the night have come to grief gilding the tiny floating swallow ’ s belly and lines of pink cloud in the sky the day ’ s preamble like wandering lines in marble the cocks are now almost inaudible the sun climbs in following “ to see the end ” faithful as enemy or friend

to the memory of the household it describes this poem is dedicated by the author “ as the spirits of darkness be stronger in the dark so good spirits which be angels of light are augmented not only by

farm-house at the garden ’ s end the sled and traveller stopped the courier ’ s feet delayed all friends shut out the housemates sit around the radiant fireplace enclosed in a tumultuous privacy of storm. ” emerson the snow storm the sun that brief december day rose cheerless over hills of gray and darkly circled gave at noon a sadder light than waning moon slow tracing down the thickening sky its mute and ominous prophecy a portent seeming less than threat it sank from sight before it set a chill no coat however stout of homespun stuff could quite shut out a hard dull bitterness of cold that checked mid-vein the circling race of life-blood in the sharpened face the coming of the snow-storm told the wind blew east we heard the roar of ocean on his wintry shore and felt the strong pulse throbbing there beat with low rhythm our inland air meanwhile we did our nightly chores — brought in the wood from out of doors littered the stalls and from the mows raked down the herd ’ s-grass for the cows heard the horse whinnying for his corn and sharply clashing horn on horn impatient down the stanchion rows the cattle shake their walnut bows while peering from his early perch upon the scaffold ’ s pole of birch the cock his crested helmet bent and down his querulous challenge sent unwarmed by any sunset light the gray day darkened into night a night made hoary with the swarm and whirl-dance of the blinding storm as zigzag wavering to and fro crossed and recrossed the wingëd snow and ere the early bedtime came the white drift piled the window-frame and through the glass the clothes-line posts looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts so all night long the storm roared on the morning broke without a sun in tiny spherule traced with lines of nature ’ s geometric signs in starry flake and pellicle all day the hoary meteor fell and when the second morning shone we looked upon a world unknown on nothing we could call our own around the glistening wonder bent the blue walls of the firmament no cloud above no earth below — a universe of sky and snow the old familiar sights of ours took marvellous shapes strange domes and towers rose up where sty or corn-crib stood or garden-wall or belt of wood a smooth white mound the brush-pile showed a fenceless drift what once was road the bridle-post an old man sat with loose-flung coat and high cocked hat the well-curb had a chinese roof and even the long sweep high aloof in its slant splendor seemed to tell of pisa ’ s leaning miracle a prompt decisive man no breath our father wasted “ boys a path ” well pleased for when did farmer boy count such a summons less than joy our buskins on our feet we drew with mittened hands and caps drawn low to guard our necks and ears from snow we cut the solid whiteness through and where the drift was deepest made a tunnel walled and overlaid with dazzling crystal we had read of rare aladdin ’ s wondrous cave and to our own his name we gave with many a wish the luck were ours to test his lamp ’ s supernal powers we reached the barn with merry din and roused the prisoned brutes within the old horse thrust his long head out and grave with wonder gazed about the cock his lusty greeting said and forth his speckled harem led the oxen lashed their tails and hooked and mild reproach of hunger looked the hornëd patriarch of the sheep like egypt ’ s amun roused from sleep shook his sage head with gesture mute and emphasized with stamp of foot all day the gusty north-wind bore the loosening drift its breath before low circling round its southern zone the sun through dazzling snow-mist shone no church-bell lent its christian tone to the savage air no social smoke curled over woods of snow-hung oak a solitude made more intense by dreary-voicëd elements the shrieking of the mindless wind the moaning tree-boughs swaying blind and on the glass the unmeaning beat of ghostly finger-tips of sleet beyond the circle of our hearth no welcome sound of toil or mirth unbound the spell and testified of human life and thought outside we minded that the sharpest ear the buried brooklet could not hear the music of whose liquid lip had been to us companionship and in our lonely life had grown to have an almost human tone as night drew on and from the crest of wooded knolls that ridged the west the sun a snow-blown traveller sank from sight beneath the smothering bank we piled with care our nightly stack of wood against the chimney-back — the oaken log green huge and thick and on its top the stout back-stick the knotty forestick laid apart and filled between with curious art the ragged brush then hovering near we watched the first red blaze appear heard the sharp crackle caught the gleam on whitewashed wall and sagging beam until the old rude-furnished room burst flower-like into rosy bloom while radiant with a mimic flame outside the sparkling drift became and through the bare-boughed lilac-tree our own warm hearth seemed blazing free the crane and pendent trammels showed the turks ’ heads on the andirons glowed while childish fancy prompt to tell the meaning of the miracle whispered the old rhyme “ under the tree when fire outdoors burns merrily there the witches are making tea. ” the moon above the eastern wood shone at its full the hill-range stood transfigured in the silver flood its blown snows flashing cold and keen dead white save where some sharp ravine took shadow or the sombre green of hemlocks turned to pitchy black against the whiteness at their back for such a world and such a night most fitting that unwarming light which only seemed where ’ er it fell to make the coldness visible shut in from all the world without we sat the clean-winged hearth about content to let the north-wind roar in baffled rage at pane and door while the red logs before us beat the frost-line back with tropic heat and ever when a louder blast shook beam and rafter as it passed the merrier up its roaring draught the great throat of the chimney laughed the house-dog on his paws outspread laid to the fire his drowsy head the cat ’ s dark silhouette on the wall a couchant tiger ’ s seemed to fall and for the winter fireside meet between the andirons ’ straddling feet the mug of cider simmered slow the apples sputtered in a row and close at hand the basket stood with nuts from brown october ’ s wood what matter how the night behaved what matter how the north-wind raved blow high blow low not all its snow could quench our hearth-fire ’ s ruddy glow o time and change —with hair as gray as was my sire ’ s that winter day how strange it seems with so much gone of life and love to still live on ah brother only i and thou are left of all that circle now — the dear home faces whereupon that fitful firelight paled and shone henceforward listen as we will the voices of that hearth are still look where we may the wide earth o ’ er those lighted faces smile no more we tread the paths their feet have worn we sit beneath their orchard trees we hear like them the hum of bees and rustle of the bladed corn we turn the pages that they read their written words we linger o ’ er but in the sun they cast no shade no voice is heard no sign is made no step is on the conscious floor yet love will dream and faith will trust since he who knows our need is just that somehow somewhere meet we must alas for him who never sees the stars shine through his cypress-trees who hopeless lays his dead away nor looks to see the breaking day across the mournful marbles play who hath not learned in hours of faith the truth to flesh and sense unknown that life is ever lord of death and love can never lose its own we sped the time with stories old wrought puzzles out and riddles told or stammered from our school-book lore “ the chief of gambia ’ s golden shore. ” how often since when all the land was clay in slavery ’ s shaping hand as if a far-blown trumpet stirred the languorous sin-sick air i heard “ does not the voice of reason cry claim the first right which nature gave from the red scourge of bondage to fly nor deign to live a burdened slave “ our father rode again his ride on memphremagog ’ s wooded side sat down again to moose and samp in trapper ’ s hut and indian camp lived o ’ er the old idyllic ease beneath st. françois ’ hemlock-trees again for him the moonlight shone on norman cap and bodiced zone again he heard the violin play which led the village dance away and mingled in its merry whirl the grandam and the laughing girl or nearer home our steps he led where salisbury ’ s level marshes spread mile-wide as flies the laden bee where merry mowers hale and strong swept scythe on scythe their swaths along the low green prairies of the sea we shared the fishing off boar ’ s head and round the rocky isles of shoals the hake-broil on the drift-wood coals the chowder on the sand-beach made dipped by the hungry steaming hot with spoons of clam-shell from the pot we heard the tales of witchcraft old and dream and sign and marvel told to sleepy listeners as they lay stretched idly on the salted hay adrift along the winding shores when favoring breezes deigned to blow the square sail of the gundelow and idle lay the useless oars our mother while she turned her wheel or run the new-knit stocking-heel told how the indian hordes came down at midnight on concheco town and how her own great-uncle bore his cruel scalp-mark to fourscore recalling in her fitting phrase so rich and picturesque and free the common unrhymed poetry of simple life and country ways the story of her early days — she made us welcome to her home old hearths grew wide to give us room we stole with her a frightened look at the gray wizard ’ s conjuring-book the fame whereof went far and wide through all the simple country side we heard the hawks at twilight play the boat-horn on piscataqua the loon ’ s weird laughter far away we fished her little trout-brook knew what flowers in wood and meadow grew what sunny hillsides autumn-brown she climbed to shake the ripe nuts down saw where in sheltered cove and bay the ducks ’ black squadron anchored lay and heard the wild-geese calling loud beneath the gray november cloud then haply with a look more grave and soberer tone some tale she gave from painful sewel ’ s ancient tome beloved in every quaker home of faith fire-winged by martyrdom or chalkley ’ s journal old and quaint — gentlest of skippers rare sea-saint — who when the dreary calms prevailed and water-butt and bread-cask failed and cruel hungry eyes pursued his portly presence mad for food with dark hints muttered under breath of casting lots for life or death offered if heaven withheld supplies to be himself the sacrifice then suddenly as if to save the good man from his living grave a ripple on the water grew a school of porpoise flashed in view “ take eat ” he said “ and be content these fishes in my stead are sent by him who gave the tangled ram to spare the child of abraham. ” our uncle innocent of books was rich in lore of fields and brooks the ancient teachers never dumb of nature ’ s unhoused lyceum in moons and tides and weather wise he read the clouds as prophecies and foul or fair could well divine by many an occult hint and sign holding the cunning-warded keys to all the woodcraft mysteries himself to nature ’ s heart so near that all her voices in his ear of beast or bird had meanings clear like apollonius of old who knew the tales the sparrows told or hermes who interpreted what the sage cranes of nilus said a simple guileless

low stir of leaves and dip of oars and lapsing waves on quiet shores next morn we wakened with the shout of merry voices high and clear and saw the teamsters drawing near to break the drifted highways out down the long hillside treading slow we saw the half-buried oxen go shaking the snow from heads uptost their straining nostrils white with frost before our door the straggling train drew up an added team to gain the elders threshed their hands a-cold passed with the cider-mug their jokes from lip to lip the younger folks down the loose snow-banks wrestling rolled then toiled again the

love the earth and hate its desecrations all the golden retrievers wore red bandannas on those muttless streets all the birches i think were aspens i do not often remember my dreams or dream of

there and a narrow black gorge not to worry i tell myself about tricks the mind plays as long as you know they ’ re tricks if the rich are casually cruel perhaps it ’ s because they can stare at the sky and never see an indictment in the shape of clouds the frown for example in a thunderhead the fist that big mountain i ’ ve been looking at— i love how it borrows purple from the filtered light sometimes red like any of us it ’ s all of its appearances it ’ s good that the rich have to die a peasant saying goes otherwise they ’ d live forever here in this rented house high up i understand i

on the wall nudes which had become dull to me like a tourist ’ s collection of smooth rocks i turned away from the view and conjured a plague of starlings oh how they darkened the landscape surely such beauty had been waiting for its elegy i felt like crushing a rhododendron now and again i feel the astonishment of being alive like this in this body the ventricles and the small bones in the hand the intricacies of digestion ... when the radio said parents in california gave birth to another child so that their older child might have a bone-marrow transplant and live i found myself weeping for such complicated beauty how wonderful the radio and its distant human voices the rain now is quite without consequence coming down i suppose i ’ ve come to the limits of my paltry

forlorn children i need a new mouth to acknowledge that piety will keep us small imprisoned that it ’ s all right to be ridiculous and sway first to the left then to the right in order to find our balance i ’ ve been watching an evening star quiver i ’ ve been trying to identify the word before its utterance give me a new mouth and i ’ ll be a guardian against forgetfulness i ’ ve noticed the

don ’ t bother the earth spirit who lives here she is working on a story it is the oldest story in the world and it is delicate changing if she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee give you warm bread and you will be obligated to stay and listen but this is no ordinary story you will have to endure earthquakes lightning the deaths of all those you love the most blinding beauty it ’ s a story so compelling you may never want to leave this is how she traps you see that stone finger over there that is the only one who ever escaped
child of distress who meet ’ st the bitter scorn of fellow-men to happier prospects born doomed art and nature ’ s various stores to see flow in full cups of joy—and not for thee who seest the rich to heaven and fate resigned bear thy afflictions with a patient mind whose bursting heart disdains unjust control who feel ’ st oppression ’ s iron in thy soul who dragg ’ st the load of faint and feeble years whose bread is anguish and whose water tears bear bear thy wrongs—fulfill thy destined hour bend thy meek neck beneath the foot of power but when thou feel ’ st the great deliverer nigh and thy freed spirit mounting seeks the sky let no vain fears thy parting hour molest no whispered terrors shake thy quiet breast think not their threats can work thy future woe nor deem the lord above like lords below — safe in the bosom of that love repose by whom the sun gives light the ocean flows prepare to meet a father undismayed nor fear the god whom priests and kings have made
spring coast range the glow of my campfire is dark red and flameless the circle of white ash widens around it i get up and walk off in the moonlight and each time i look back the red is deeper and the light smaller scorpio rises late with mars caught in his claw the moon has come before them the light like a choir of children in the young laurel trees it is april the shad the hot headed fish climbs the rivers there is trillium in the damp canyons the foetid adder ’ s tongue lolls by the waterfall there was a farm at this campsite once it is almost gone now there were sheep here after the farm and fire long ago burned the redwoods out of the gulch the douglas fir off the ridge today the soil is stony and incoherent the small stones lie flat and plate the surface like scales twenty years ago the spreading gully toppled the big oak over onto the house now there is nothing left but the foundations hidden in poison oak and above on the ridge six lonely ominous fenceposts the redwood beams of the barn make a footbridge over the deep waterless creek bed the hills are covered with wild oats dry and white by midsummer i walk in the random survivals of the orchard in a patch of moonlight a mole shakes his tunnel like an angry vein orion walks waist deep in the fog coming in from the ocean leo crouches under the zenith there are tiny hard fruits already on the plum trees the purity of the apple blossoms is incredible as the wind dies down their fragrance clusters around them like thick smoke all the day they roared with bees in the moonlight they are silent and immaculate spring sierra nevada once more golden scorpio glows over the col above deadman canyon orderly and brilliant like an inspiration in the brain of archimedes i have seen its light over the warm sea over the coconut beaches phosphorescent and pulsing and the living light in the water shivering away from the swimming hand creeping against the lips filling the floating hair here where the glaciers have been and the snow stays late the stone is clean as light the light steady as stone the relationship of stone ice and stars is systematic and enduring novelty emerges after centuries a rock spalls from the cliffs the glacier contracts and turns grayer the stream cuts new sinuosities in the meadow the sun moves through space and the earth with it the stars change places the snow has lasted longer this year than anyone can remember the lowest meadow is a lake the next two are snowfields the pass is covered with snow only the steepest rocks are bare between the pass and the last meadow the snowfield gapes for a hundred feet in a narrow blue chasm through which a waterfall drops spangled with sunset at the top black and muscular where it disappears again in the snow the world is filled with hidden running water that pounds in the ears like ether the granite needles rise from the snow pale as steel above the copper mine the cliff is blood red the white snow breaks at the edge of it the sky comes close to my eyes like the blue eyes of someone kissed in sleep i descend to camp to the young sticky wrinkled aspen leaves to the first violets and wild cyclamen and cook supper in the blue twilight all night deer pass over the snow on sharp hooves in the darkness their cold muzzles find the new grass at the edge of the snow fall sierra nevada this morning the hermit thrush was absent at breakfast his place was taken by a family of chickadees at noon a flock of humming birds passed south whirling in the wind up over the saddle between ritter and banner following the migration lane of the sierra crest southward to guatemala all day cloud shadows have moved over the face of the mountain the shadow of a golden eagle weaving between them over the face of the glacier at sunset the half-moon rides on the bent back of the scorpion the great bear kneels on the mountain ten degrees below the moon venus sets in the haze arising from the great valley jupiter in opposition to the sun rises in the alpenglow between the burnt peaks the ventriloquial belling of an owl mingles with the bells of the waterfall now there is distant thunder on the east wind the east face of the mountain above me is lit with far off lightnings and the sky above the pass blazes momentarily like an aurora it is storming in the white mountains on the arid fourteen-thousand-foot peaks rain is falling on the narrow gray ranges and dark sedge meadows and white salt flats of nevada just before moonset a small dense cumulus cloud gleaming like a grape cluster of metal moves over the sierra crest and grows down the westward slope frost the color and quality of the cloud lies over all the marsh below my campsite the wiry clumps of dwarfed whitebark pines are smoky and indistinct in the moonlight only their shadows are really visible the lake is immobile and holds the stars and the peaks deep in itself without a quiver in the shallows the geometrical tendrils of ice spread their wonderful mathematics in silence all night the eyes of deer shine for an instant as they cross the radius of my firelight in the morning the trail will look like a sheep driveway all the tracks will point down to the lower canyon “ thus ” says tyndall “ the concerns of this little place are changed and fashioned by the obliquity of the earth ’ s axis the chain of dependence which runs through creation and links the roll of a planet alike with the interests of marmots and of men ”

for fabbio doplicher we were supposed to do a job in italy and full of our feeling for ourselves our sense of being poets from america we went from rome to fano met the mayor mulled a couple matters over what's a cheap date they asked us what's flat drink among italian literati we could recognize our counterparts the academic the apologist the arrogant the amorous the brazen and the glib—and there was one administrator the conservative in suit of regulation gray who like a good tour guide with measured pace and uninflected tone narrated sights and histories the hired van hauled us past of all he was the most politic and least poetic so it seemed our last few days in rome when all but three of the new world bards had flown i found a book of poems this unprepossessing one had written it was there in the pensione room a room he 'd recommended where it must have been abandoned by the german visitor was there a bus of them to whom he had inscribed and dated it a month before i could n't read italian either so i put the book back into the wardrobe 's dark we last americans were due to leave tomorrow for our parting evening then our host chose something in a family restaurant and there we sat and chatted sat and chewed till sensible it was our last big chance to be poetic make our mark one of us asked `` what 's poetry '' is it the fruits and vegetables and marketplace of campo dei fiori or the statue there '' because i was the glib one i identified the answer instantly i did n't have to think— '' the truth is both it 's both '' i blurted out but that was easy that was easiest to say what followed taught me something about difficulty for our underestimated host spoke out all of a sudden with a rising passion and he said the statue represents giordano bruno brought to be burned in the public square because of his offense against authority which is to say the church his crime was his belief the universe does not revolve around the human being god is no fixed point or central government but rather is poured in waves through all things all things move `` if god is not the soul itself he is the soul of the soul of the world '' such was his heresy the day they brought him forth to die they feared he might incite the crowd the man was famous for his eloquence and so his captors placed upon his face an iron mask in which he could not speak that's how they burned him that is how he died without a word in front of everyone and poetry— we 'd all put down our forks by now to listen to the man in gray he went on softly — poetry is what he thought but did not say

we were dreaming on an occupied island at the farthest edge of a trembling nation when it went down two towers rose up from the east island of commerce and touched the sky men walked on the moon oil was sucked dry by two brothers then it went down swallowed by a fire dragon by oil and fear eaten whole it was coming we had been watching since the eve of the missionaries in their long and solemn clothes to see what would happen we saw it from the kitchen window over the sink as we made coffee cooked rice and potatoes enough for an army we saw it all as we changed diapers and fed the babies we saw it through the branches of the knowledgeable tree through the snags of stars through the sun and storms from our knees as we bathed and washed the floors the conference of the birds warned us as they flew over destroyers in the harbor parked there since the first takeover it was by their song and talk we knew when to rise when to look out the window to the commotion going on— the magnetic field thrown off by grief we heard it the racket in every corner of the world as the hunger for war rose up in those who would steal to be president to be king or emperor to own the trees stones and everything else that moved about the earth inside the earth and above it we knew it was coming tasted the winds who gathered intelligence from each leaf and flower from every mountain sea and desert from every prayer and song all over this tiny universe floating in the skies of infinite being and then it was over this world we had grown to love for its sweet grasses for the many-colored horses and fishes for the shimmering possibilities while dreaming but then there were the seeds to plant and the babies who needed milk and comforting and someone picked up a guitar or ukulele from the rubble and began to sing about the light flutter the kick beneath the skin of the earth we felt there beneath us a warm animal a song being born between the legs of her a poem
in this world the isle of dreams while we sit by sorrow ’ s streams tears and terrors are our themes reciting but when once from hence we fly more and more approaching nigh unto young eternity uniting in that whiter island where things are evermore sincere candor here and luster there delighting there no monstrous fancies shall out of hell an horror call to create or cause at all affrighting there in calm and cooling sleep we our eyes shall never steep but eternal watch shall keep attending pleasures such as shall pursue me immortalized and you and fresh joys as never too have ending
lord how can man preach thy eternal word he is a brittle crazy glass yet in thy temple thou dost him afford this glorious and transcendent place to be a window through thy grace but when thou dost anneal in glass thy story making thy life to shine within the holy preachers then the light and glory more reverend grows and more doth win which else shows waterish bleak and thin doctrine and life colors and light in one when they combine and mingle bring a strong regard and awe but speech alone doth vanish like a flaring thing and in the ear not conscience ring
how like an angel came i down how bright are all things here when first among his works i did appear o how their glory me did crown the world resembled his eternity in which my soul did walk and ev ’ ry thing that i did see did with me talk the skies in their magnificence the lively lovely air oh how divine how soft how sweet how fair the stars did entertain my sense and all the works of god so bright and pure so rich and great did seem as if they ever must endure in my esteem a native health and innocence within my bones did grow and while my god did all his glories show i felt a vigour in my sense that was all spirit i within did flow with seas of life like wine i nothing in the world did know but ’ twas divine harsh ragged objects were conceal ’ d oppressions tears and cries sins griefs complaints dissensions weeping eyes were hid and only things reveal ’ d which heav ’ nly spirits and the angels prize the state of innocence and bliss not trades and poverties did fill my sense the streets were pav ’ d with golden stones the boys and girls were mine oh how did all their lovely faces shine the sons of men were holy ones in joy and beauty they appear ’ d to me and every thing which here i found while like an angel i did see adorn ’ d the ground rich diamond and pearl and gold in ev ’ ry place was seen rare splendours yellow blue red white and green mine eyes did everywhere behold great wonders cloth ’ d with glory did appear amazement was my bliss that and my wealth was ev ’ ry where no joy to this curs ’ d and devis ’ d proprieties with envy avarice and fraud those fiends that spoil even paradise flew from the splendour of mine eyes and so did hedges ditches limits bounds i dream ’ d not aught of those but wander ’ d over all men ’ s grounds and found repose proprieties themselves were mine and hedges ornaments walls boxes coffers and their rich contents did not divide my joys but all combine clothes ribbons jewels laces i esteem ’ d my joys by others worn for me they all to wear them seem ’ d when i was born
for sitti khadra north of jerusalem my grandmother ’ s hands recognize grapes the damp shine of a goat ’ s new skin when i was sick they followed me i woke from the long fever to find them covering my head like cool prayers my grandmother ’ s days are made of bread a round pat-pat and the slow baking she waits by the oven watching a strange car circle the streets maybe it holds her son lost to america more often tourists who kneel and weep at mysterious shrines she knows how often mail arrives how rarely there is a letter when one comes she announces it a miracle listening to it read again and again in the dim evening light my grandmother ’ s voice says nothing can surprise her take her the shotgun wound and the crippled baby she knows the spaces we travel through the messages we can not send—our voices are short and would get lost on the journey farewell to the husband ’ s coat the ones she has loved and nourished who fly from her like seeds into a deep sky they will plant themselves we will all die my grandmother ’ s eyes say allah is everywhere even in death when she talks of the orchard and the new olive press when she tells the stories of joha and his foolish wisdoms he is her first thought what she really thinks of is his name “ answer if you hear the words under the words— otherwise it is just a world with a lot of rough edges difficult to get through and our pockets full of stones ”
i saw eternity the other night like a great ring of pure and endless light all calm as it was bright and round beneath it time in hours days years driv ’ n by the spheres like a vast shadow mov ’ d in which the world and all her train were hurl ’ d the doting lover in his quaintest strain did there complain near him his lute his fancy and his flights wit ’ s sour delights with gloves and knots the silly snares of pleasure yet his dear treasure all scatter ’ d lay while he his eyes did pour upon a flow ’ r the darksome statesman hung with weights and woe like a thick midnight-fog mov ’ d there so slow he did not stay nor go condemning thoughts like sad eclipses scowl upon his soul and clouds of crying witnesses without pursued him with one shout yet digg ’ d the mole and lest his ways be found work ’ d under ground where he did clutch his prey but one did see that policy churches and altars fed him perjuries were gnats and flies it rain ’ d about him blood and tears but he drank them as free the fearful miser on a heap of rust sate pining all his life there did scarce trust his own hands with the dust yet would not place one piece above but lives in fear of thieves thousands there were as frantic as himself and hugg ’ d each one his pelf the downright epicure plac ’ d heav ’ n in sense and scorn ’ d pretence while others slipp ’ d into a wide excess said little less the weaker sort slight trivial wares enslave who think them brave and poor despised truth sate counting by their victory yet some who all this while did weep and sing and sing and weep soar ’ d up into the ring but most would use no wing o fools said i thus to prefer dark night before true light to live in grots and caves and hate the day because it shews the way the way which from this dead and dark abode leads up to god a way where you might tread the sun and be more bright than he but as i did their madness so discuss one whisper ’ d thus “ this ring the bridegroom did for none provide but for his bride ”
the harp at nature ’ s advent strung has never ceased to play the song the stars of morning sung has never died away and prayer is made and praise is given by all things near and far the ocean looketh up to heaven and mirrors every star its waves are kneeling on the strand as kneels the human knee their white locks bowing to the sand the priesthood of the sea they pour their glittering treasures forth their gifts of pearl they bring and all the listening hills of earth take up the song they sing the green earth sends its incense up from many a mountain shrine from folded leaf and dewy cup she pours her sacred wine the mists above the morning rills rise white as wings of prayer the altar-curtains of the hills are sunset ’ s purple air the winds with hymns of praise are loud or low with sobs of pain — the thunder-organ of the cloud the dropping tears of rain with drooping head and branches crossed the twilight forest grieves or speaks with tongues of pentecost from all its sunlit leaves the blue sky is the temple ’ s arch its transept earth and air the music of its starry march the chorus of a prayer so nature keeps the reverent frame with which her years began and all her signs and voices shame the prayerless heart of man
oh fortune thy wresting wavering state hath fraught with cares my troubled wit whose witness this present prison late could bear where once was joy ’ s loan quit thou causedst the guilty to be loosed from bands where innocents were inclosed and caused the guiltless to be reserved and freed those that death had well deserved but all herein can be nothing wrought so god send to my foes all they have thought
i ’ ve expanded like the swollen door in summer to fit my own dimension your loneliness is a letter i read and put away a daily reminder in the cry of the magpie that i am still capable of inflicting pain at this distance like a painting our talk is dense with description half-truths landscapes phrases layered with a patina over time when she came into my life i didn ’ t hesitate or is that only how it seems now looking back or is that only how you accuse me looking back long ago this desert was an inland sea in the mountains you can still find shells it ’ s these strange divagations i ’ ve come to love midday sun on pink escarpments dusk on gray sandstone toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot climb to acoma pueblo where the spirit of the dead hovers about its earthly home four days before the prayer sticks drive it away today all good jews collect their crimes like old clothes to be washed and given to the poor i remember how my father held his father around the shoulders as they walked to the old synagogue in philadelphia `` we 're almost there pop '' he said `` a few more blocks '' i want to tell you that we too are almost there for someone has mapped this autumn field with meaning and any day october brooding in me will open to reveal our names—inscribed or absent — among the dry thistles and spent weeds

i did not call to the holy spirit or whistle my lordy lordy nor hum one scintilla of shame what hid in the grass was neither skiver nor savior neither cheater nor ace besides the doves peering over the gutters have all gone awry if i ’ m only a man born far from a boomer ’ s shack— hoarding sawbucks cherry-picking the hicks like prey and the wusses and the horacian declaimers and the lucky grubbers who master heartache and lurk like crooks among the rich and the rebadged—then i ’ m a rival devil carrying my brag like a brakeman and the one certainty that life is to be lost—and no matter the opinion someone ’ s always a fool—has me rubbed inside like a lonely breed with the swill edgy and chic and rough who asks who needs a cotton-eyed hymn to say what the old shanty by the track has meant to the human story or what ’ s heaven for the reach and grasp the pecked-at days the horsey blues that lilac after hours the rocks i ’ ve carried in my coat pocket— none of it has me shuddering on my knees nevertheless i marvel at the pigs and the ducks at dogs and kings and revive this peck of flame this tongue of lack too easily
and so their pounded hearts were worn— like a badge or talisman that canceled almost all their blindness— creation 's linkage depending on a drive itself derived from a kind of kindness or desperation the sense that one's inadequate at any rate the space for time— water has it flowing even from a faucet and here the black swan glides across it— as the sunlight 's suddenly on my back and now the skin along it 's warmer lord which lets me walk by the river
and the levites shall speak and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice —deuteronomy 27:14 over the border the barrier winds devouring orchards of various kinds cursed be he that taketh away the landmark of his neighbor and all the people shall say amen the road was blocked in a battle of wills— as the lame and sightless trudged through the hills cursed be he that maketh the blind to go astray in the way and all the people shall say amen the army has nearly written a poem you 'll now need a permit just to stay home cursed be he that perverteth the justice due to the stranger in scripture and all the people shall say amen taken away—in the dead of night— by the secret policeman who might be a levite cursed be he that turneth to smite his neighbor in secret murder and all the people shall say amen— as peace is sought through depredation living together in separation cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law—to do them and all the people shall say amen
the shift of sleepwalks and suicides the occasion of owls and a demi-lune fog even god has nodded off and wo n't be taking prayers til ten ad interim you put them on as if your wants could keep you warm as if you say your shibboleths you thumb your beads you scry the glass night creeps to its precipice and the broken rim of reason breaks again an obsidian sky betrays you every serrate shadow flays you soon enough the crow will caw the cock will crow the door will close he is n't coming back you know and so wee wet hours of grief relent in thirty years you might forget precisely how tonight 's pain felt and in whose black house you dwelt
a childless futureless road and then nothing is that it or start believing in a god beyond the temporal limit of westering skies wide melancholy uncut fields and paced-out walls as we drive towards it slowly the house that has us both in thrall they are gone now the hours of light it took to get here might-have-beens lost wanderyears but that 's alright— we are trading it in the seen for the experienced the car keys for the end of the journey when distances have lost their power and the heart beats slower in tomorrow 's cold a coming weather one degree north of yesterday high latitudes—as they say there is nothing up here but wind and silence passing clouds light diminished half a tone a dish left out all night for the gods by morning turned to stone so take a right go down two gears and stay in second where the church is and the pig farm only the approaches are terrible only the years the getting here which takes forever a boy in tears a barren crone on a bicycle a man alone— they 're waving it 's now or never for the final self i assume— for the shape of the house on the skyline the release into childhood and the coming home
1 god twirled across the face of what can not be named since it was not moving god was momentum then that impatience with interruption stamping time 's blanks with its own image 2 now her theme will be that she has escaped certain destruction that she is impossibly lucky this theme should be jaunty but slightly discordant coming in as it does so late the character associated with this theme should be dressed in markedly old-fashioned clothing— a hoop skirt perhaps— while everyone else is in cut-offs ready for the barbeque
into the rood wood where the grain 's current splits around the stones of its knots carve eyelashes and eyelids dye the knots too—indigo ink-black vermillion irises these will be his eyes always open willing themselves not to close when dust rises or sweat falls eyes witnessing dimly the eclipse that shawls the shuddering hill jerusalem 's naked shoulder the body itself from a wick that still whiffs of smolder wax because wax sloughs a smooth skein on the fingers just below sensation 's threshold prop the cross upright and let the tear-hot wax trickle slow clot taper into a torso thighs calves feet of gideon bible paper thinner than skin cut him his scrap of cloth embed iron shavings in his forehead and as the wax cools scrape the rust off an old fuel can to salt the whole wound that is the man cry if you feel like crying and if no one else is there then set it on the counter with your other wares
in his fear of solitude he made us fearing eternity he gave us time i hear his white cane thumping up and down the hall i expect neighbors to complain but no the little girl who sobbed when her daddy crawled into her bed is quiet now it 's quarter to two on this street of darkened pawnshops welfare hotels and tenements one or two ragged puppets are awake
without intending to hide the imagined copperhead hid on the path ahead unseen on bronze leaves unheard and a mortal likelihood at every step this was childhood mine the wood ’ s jihad against a boy who ’ d intruded among monkshood wasp tick and nettles haired with needles scrub brush abhorred him with a horde of welts bites and stings but he ’ d never seen a copperhead though he ’ d looked hard taking as he ’ d been ordered heed the snake wasn ’ t a falsehood though to him dread was his nature and he hared through sunlight and shade head swiveling for the copperhead he ’ d begun to covet the ballyhooed killer a camouflaged godhead on which his inborn faith cohered and his priesthood
for years my heart inquired of me where jamshid 's sacred cup might be and what was in its own possession it asked from strangers constantly begging the pearl that 's slipped its shell from lost souls wandering by the sea last night i took my troubles to the magian sage whose keen eyes see a hundred answers in the wine whose cup he laughing showed to me i questioned him `` when was this cup that shows the world 's reality handed to you '' he said `` the day heaven 's vault of lapis lazuli was raised and marvelous things took place by intellect 's divine decree and moses miracles were made and sameri 's apostasy '' he added then `` that friend they hanged high on the looming gallows tree— his sin was that he spoke of things which should be pondered secretly the page of truth his heart enclosed was annotated publicly but if the holy ghost once more should lend his aid to us we 'd see others perform what jesus did— since in his heartsick anguish he was unaware that god was there and called his name out ceaselessly '' i asked him next `` and beauties curls that tumble down so sinuously what is their meaning whence do they come '' `` hafez '' the sage replied to me '' it 's your distracted lovelorn heart that asks these questions constantly ''
the christian can not be the pitying one because he is the one pitied from a dusty road in a straight line from przedmiescie to krasnystaw at the entrance to town at zhitkovski 's in his house we lived he makes coffins with crosses on the threshold i sat as a boy opposite a building held together by nails facing the church the cloister the impurity my mother says i sat as a boy on the wall jesus and mary jesus and his mother were never parted my mother 's son left her not to be on the wall mary 's son never left and he paid the price —october 26-29 1989
after the summer 's yield lord it is time to let your shadow lengthen on the sundials and in the pastures let the rough winds fly as for the final fruits coax them to roundness direct on them two days of warmer light to hale them golden toward their term and harry the last few drops of sweetness through the wine whoever 's homeless now will build no shelter who lives alone will live indefinitely so waking up to read a little draft long letters and along the city 's avenues fitfully wander when the wild leaves loosen
we aged a hundred years and this descended in just one hour as at a stroke the summer had been brief and now was ended the body of the ploughed plains lay in smoke the hushed road burst in colors then a soaring lament rose ringing silver like a bell and so i covered up my face imploring god to destroy me before battle fell and from my memory the shadows vanished of songs and passions—burdens i 'd not need the almighty bade it be—with all else banished— a book of portents terrible to read
at the sight of the great light dawning in that glad night small birds come singing to celebrate him with their sweet voices and even the imperial eagle soaring on the wind sings a melodious song saying jesus is born to lift us from sin and bring us joy
`` i thought of you as a butterfly tonight '' getting to eschatology from a sketchpad your mom 's and though you write sermons nice and linear you also digress and about-face the jeroboam trees are dark tonight darker in the outage than the stars let the sky be partyers all the abbot told you `` i do not have power the archbishop does not have power the pope does not have power only god has power '' then it is not a kind of violence to put a photo of the pope in a luscious hacienda imperilled by a minature pullbell someone admired the hostess 's oils `` yes it was a surprise when they hired me to teach but they said 'we can teach an artist to teach but we ca n't teach a teacher to be an artist '' `` how true '' the guests murmured this was not your mother though artists all say it `` comes from somewhere else '' when another guest compared the catholic to the episcopal service she said `` i think not '' in a desert once i almost fell off a cliff to calm me down a friend told a joke `` descartes was sitting on a plane the stewardess said 'coffee or tea 'i think not descartes said and vanished '' it took a moment to sink in because i thought he said `` the cart '' as in `` beverage cart '' confusion is the only way to get to eschatology from a sketchpad i 'm trying to redeem that abbot drawing in the outage once you suggest the origins of music lay in the necessity of drowning out the cries of sacrificial victims i start listening for them—the cries—under my own singing scholars resurrect books all the time just by quoting them when roman gods popped out of the soil the christians looked around wildly sculpt the mouth around `` sculpture '' ulpt they reburied them hurriedly and the earth gulped the statue of the commendatore went down with don giovanni which shall i believe the unrepentence of the sinkholed don or the statue that converts leontes by resurrecting his all-forgiving wife hermione who 's peerless has a likeness he who wo n't about-face is not `` mocked by art '' but brought posthaste to hell his `` shapely seat and heart '' the moon slips out like a foreign coin from denim a drachma an as can we redeem it cities are places are conversion you said but i am citiless `` she ascended to the thrown '' you wrote by mistake of elizabeth
even if you love the racket of ascension you must know how the power leaves you and at this pitch who has time for meditation the sea walled in by buildings i do miss the quiet do n't you when i said `` fuck the deer antlered and hithered in fur '' it was because i had seen the faces of presidents balled into a fist if i were in charge i would know how to fix the world free health care or free physicals at least and an abiding love for the abstract when i said `` all of history is saved for us '' it was because i scorned the emancipated sky does the anthem choke you up when i asked god if anyone born to slaves would die a slave he said `` sure as a rock descending a hillside '' that 's why i 'm not a christian
love we were young once and ran races over rough ground in our best shiny shoes we kicked at stones we fell over pulled faces our knees were filthy with our secret places with rituals and ranks with strategy and ruse love we were young once and ran races to determine the most rudimentary of graces such as strength and speed and the ability to bruise we kicked at stones we fell over pulled faces and doing so left no permanent traces because we fought and fell only to confuse love we were young once we ran races in ghettos in camps in the dismal spaces of the imagination reserved for jews we kicked at stones we fell over pulled faces at elastic braces shoelaces empty packing cases as if they were the expressions we could choose love we were young once and ran races we kicked at stones we fell over we pulled faces
the eye is drawn to that single yellow star that no wise man will follow the hunched men in caps the grimacing woman her eyes screwed up cheeks hollow we look and look again until we burn a hole in the paper we strive to learn from their resignation but it is beyond us we let them burn

in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread you put this rather beautifully and gave me leave to sing my work until my work became the song in sorrow shalt thou eat of it a line on which a man might ring the changes as he tills the ground from which he was taken thistle thorn in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed these too shall it bring forth to thee all the days of thy life till the end the synagogue of the ear of corn poem and plowman cleave the dark one ca n't eat art but dust is art and unto dust shall i return o let my song become my work
for '' i 'm leaving you '' she said `` for you make me sick '' but of course she did n't say that she thought the `` for '' she admired its elegant distance the way it 's wedged like an iron strut between result and cause the way it 's almost `` far '' and dire as a raised eyebrow she liked the way it sounds like speaking through a cardboard paper towel tube using it for a megaphone not loud but strong all those compacted years shoving out the other end as if she were certain she wanted to be alone or the first four bars of beethoven 's sixth the pastorale repeat and repeat always with variation or and or something to violate expectations not fully antiphonal only an oar dipped into the measure to make an interior swirl pulling the craft slightly to the side yet ahead still little cupped trails alongside to mark where the mind turned questions were asked and shed before moving on nothing that ca n't be repaired nor as a flower sheds petal after petal as further tests strip away one after another of the last hopes for a cure as a person shakes into the waste bin all her cigarettes and goes down the street not knowing who she is the pure air of saints is achieved by abandonment jesus in the garden alone cold moon disappearing buddha at the morning star mind emptied of its snarl of ignorance neither to harden against loss nor to welcome it to let it be who you are
pain trains an undisciplined mind i will end yours if you end mine little feet little feet are playing hopscotch among the landmines hope has worked miracles before if yours did n't how can mine i could have learned to welcome night if only you had been mine how dare you put words in god 's mouth shail why not he put ashes in mine
the lightning struck him and left a scar the wind stopped blowing and the wheat stood up self-tensed self who is this i that says i i had a scar in the shape of lightning that split in half when i opened my mouth the sun just a circle of heat in the sky throwing absence in the shape of clouds down on the field another life placed in the middle of the life i called my own a lesser god commanded the front return a little god knocked about in the germ the third person put me outside my own sphere a small god chanting lightning in the synapse wind blows the wheat down he calls it prayer
by way of my mother the deacon with the slick gray hair and money clip in his pocket can claim a percentage of my body like tithe rights and on this sunday as with every other sunday he is a slender ebony panel in the fence of faith one man in the company of men standing shoulder to shoulder in suits tapping their toes clapping their hands putting muscle to work in the making of praise music we baptists call this devotion my working definition of which is faithfulness to the light to the extent that god is as white as the clouds of heaven this theory holds to the extent these particular men are dark i must consider other possibilities that god remade himself in my image so that we could be closer or that devotion means the commitment of black men to stand with one another form a barricade of soldiers against anything as necessary the lord being the force holding them fast in line it isn ’ t always easy for me to see these explanations as separate any film any photograph of martin luther king jr. leading a march with his position centered in a line of bodies covering the entire width of the frame — if i take a wide view of that scene i see the lord at work if i zoom in on a single person or the breach between two i see no trace of the lord at all a hint that he can ’ t exist in small spaces and what ’ s more consider this say chicago pd pulls a long line of youths into the precinct for photographs — all of them dark all of them wearing the same colors — and stands them shoulder to shoulder zoom in nothing zoom out the lord why not there ’ s clearly commitment there devotion they ’ re all definitely soldiers on the battlefield for something maybe it ’ s white maybe it ’ s green maybe it ’ s a colorless feeling i ’ ve got no good answers only darkness i ’ m still trying to decipher if it means anything that dr. king lived in vice lords territory when he spent ’ 66 in chicago that the words “ vice ” and “ lord ” are affiliates homeboys next-door neighbors i think about their coming up together in the mind of a boy living on that side of town a percentage of his body perhaps claimed as a tax i can ’ t shake this feeling that when he throws his muscles into praise music when sound leaves his precious mouth people scatter i can ’ t help but believe our songs to one another would be familiar church family i am on the battlefield for my lord i ’ m on the battlefield for my lord and i promised him that i would serve him till i die till i die till i die till i die
someone is about to come but does n't is about to turn on the stairs but does n't i button my shirt come from the laundry with all its dazzling blots like one 's peculiar fate i shut the door sit quietly the fan begins to whirl and turn the air into a whirlpool of fire making a noise bigger than the house someone is about to come and does n't it does n't matter calmly i lean against the wall become a wall a wounded bird on my shoulder laughs raucously laughs at the shoulder it perches on my soul of flesh and blood puts a long thread in the needle 's eye i stitch a patch on my son 's umbrella i pick his nose and name the pickings i call one `` elephant '' and another `` lion '' someone is about to come and does n't is about to turn on the stairs and does n't i tickle my children they tickle me in turn i laugh with a will for i do not feel tickled it does n't matter i scan their fingers for signs nine conches and one wheel note `` nine conches and one wheel '' are formations of lines on the tips of fingers which in indian palmistry foretell a happy life
you would n't have believed it how the man a little touched perhaps set his hands together and prayed for happiness yet not his own he meant his people by which he meant not people really but trees and cows the dirty horses dogs the fox who lived at the back of his place with her kits and the very night who settled down to rock his place to sleep the place he tried so hard to tend he found he mended fences in his sleep he said to the you above who let's be honest does n't say too much i need you now up there to give my people happiness you let them smile and know the reason hear my prayer old yam the you who 's you might laugh at that and i agree it 's funny to make a prayer like that the down-home words and yonder reach of what he said and calling god the elder sweet potato shucks that 's pretty funny and kind of sad
my mother does not trust women without it what are they not hiding renders the dead living and the living more alive everything i say sets the clouds off blubbering like they knew the pretty dead true no mascara no evidence blue sky blank face blank face a faithful liar false bottom sorrow a rabbit harbored in the head the skin a silly one-act concurs at the carnival each child 's cheek becomes a rainbow god grant me a brighter myself each breath a game called live forever i am small do n't ask me to reconcile one shadow with another i admit— paint the dead pink it does not make them sunrise paint the living blue it does not make them sky or sea a berry clapboard house or dead god leave us our costumes do n't blow in our noses strip us to the underside of skin even the earth claims color once a year dressed in red leaves as the trees play grieving
somewhere in eden after all this time does there still stand abandoned like a ruined city gates sealed with grisly nails the luckless garden is sultry day still followed there by sultry dusk sultry night where on the branches sallow and purple the fruit hangs rotting is there still underground spreading like lace among the rocks a network of unexploited lodes onyx and gold through the lush greenery their wash echoing afar do there still flow the four glassy streams of which no mortal drinks somewhere in eden after all this time does there still stand like a city in ruins forsaken doomed to slow decay the failed garden
as i drew nearer to the end of all desire i brought my longing 's ardor to a final height just as i ought my vision becoming pure entered more and more the beam of that high light that shines on its own truth from then my seeing became too large for speech which fails at a sight beyond all boundaries at memory 's undoing— as when the dreamer sees and after the dream the passion endures imprinted on his being though he ca n't recall the rest i am the same inside my heart although my vision is almost entirely faded droplets of its sweetness come the way the sun dissolves the snow 's crust— the way in the wind that stirred the light leaves the oracle that the sibyl wrote was lost
the word the stone the ringing phone the part of me that wants to be alone the vow of silence in the reeds god descends in ravenese the vinegar tasters dip their fingers make their faces stoic bitter strangely sweet the seeker leaves for bangladesh the prophets check for signs of theft the singers sing for what is left the children breathe come of age search the faces for a taste of what 's to come the widening road the row your boat he choked with weeds the rabbit hole this holding on the word the stone the ringing phone the part of we that answers when alone

let ’ s send them home in halves. ” and jumped back down around the tower 1000 greeks 1000 ilians amid their swirl his green hair dressed in braids each braid tipped with a little silver bell note nyro of simi—the handsomest of all the greeks save a. the trouble was he had no fight he dashed from fight to fight struck a quick blow then dashed straight out again save that this time he caught as prince aenéas caught his breath that prince ’ s eye who blocked his dash and as lord panda waved and walked away took his head off his spine with a backhand slice— beautiful stuff straight from the blade still as it was a special head mowgag aenéas ’ minder— bright as a box of rocks but musical— spiked it then hoisted it and twizzling the pole beneath the blue the miles of empty air marched to the chingaling of its tinklers a knees high majorette towards the greeks the tower a roar of wind across the battlefield a pause and then scattering light the plain turned crystal where their glidepath stopped the queen of heaven shrills “ typhoid for troy ” and through poor nyro ’ s wobbling mouth athena yells “ slew of assiduous mediocrities meek greeks ” it is enough centre-plain wide lit everywhere by rays of glorious light they rushed their standards into ilium diomed for once swept forward converting shame to exaltation with his cry “ never—to helen ’ s gold without her self never—to helen ’ s self without her gold ” mowgag well slain hewn through his teeth his jaw slashed off and nyro ’ s head beside him in the grass when nyro ’ s mother heard of this she shaved her head she tore her frock she went outside ripping her fingernails through her cheeks then down her neck her chest her breasts and bleeding to her waist ran round the shops sobbing “ god kill troy console me with its death revenge is all i have my boy was kind he had his life to live i will not have the chance to dance in hector ’ s blood but let me hear some have before i die. ” “ i saw her running round i took the photograph it summed the situation up he was her son they put it out in colour right my picture went around the world. ” down the shaft of the shot in his short-staved bow lord panda has been follow-spotting diomed between “ her self ” “ her gold ” he shoots it hits and as its barbs protrude through dio ’ s back aenéas hears lord panda shout “ he bleeds the totem greek right-shoulder-front how wise of artemis to make panda her matador her numero uno moi ” diomed hit the heart went out of those who followed him and they fell back shields all round diomed on his knees lifting his hands “ sister and wife of god ” as sethynos breaks off the arrowhead “ eliminate my pain. ” settles his knee beneath his hero ’ s shoulderblades “ let me kill that oaf who claims my death ” bridges his nape with one hand “ before it comes with honour to my name. ” then with his other hand in one long strong slow pull drew the shank back and out she heard his prayer before their breathless eyes his blood ran back into the pout the shank had left and to complete her miracle lord diomed rose up between them stood in the air then hovered down onto his toes brimming with homicidal joy imparting it to greece then troy was driven back trampling the half-stripped still-masked carcasses hatching the centre of the plain aenéas panda “ get him. ” “ get him i got him he is dead but there he is. ” and diomed has spotted them “ calm down ” aenéas said “ perhaps he is possessed. ” “ what god would visit him ” “ so pray to yours—and try another shot. ” “ huntress ” lord panda prays bright-ankled god of nets and lines of tangled mountains ilex groves and dark cascades ” but artemis was bored with him and let him rise still praying hard into the downflight of the javelin diomed aired at prince aenéas sunlit it went through panda ’ s lips out through his neck and then through biblock ’ s neck and so they fell the lord face up the friend face down gripping the blood-smeared barb between his teeth between the sea and snow aenéas covers them eyeing his plate —technology you can enjoy— diomed found and threw a stone as heavy as a cabbage made of lead that hit and split aenéas ’ hip who went down on one knee and put his shield hand on the grass and with his other hand covered his eyes dido might have become a grandmother and rome not had its day except as diomed came on to lop his top aenéas ’ mama aphrodité dressed in grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold and snake-skin flip-flops stepped between him and the greek a glow came from her throat and from her hair a fragrance that betokened the divine stooping she kissed him better as queen hera whispered “ greek cut that bitch. ” and diomed you did nicking love ’ s wrist studying the ichor as it seeped across her pulse into her palm our lady of the thong lifted her other hand removed a baby cobra from her hair and dropped it diomed onto your neck and saw its bite release its bane into your blood then nobody could say who diomed fought for or for what he fought rapt through the mass now shouting at the sky now stomping on the plain he killed and killed and killed greek trojan greek lord/less shame/fame both gone and gone loyalty nurtured in the face of death the duty of revenge the right to kill to jeer to strip to gloat to be the first to rally but the last to run all gone— and gone our lady aphrodité giggling while everywhere driving your fellow greeks back down the long incline that leads to the scamánder ’ s ford surely as when lit from the dark part of the sky by sudden beams a bitter wind detonates line by line of waves against the shore no mind even as teucer backed away he kept his eyes on you “ you feel the stress you feel the fear behold your enemy the prince god loves ” see teucer ’ s bow hear teucer ’ s “ this time lucky. ” his— but this time it was not our father god who saved your life my prince as agamemnon cried “ the ships are safe stand at the riverside ’ s far bank. ” teléspiax heard the rustle of lord teucer ’ s shot and stood between yourself and it his head was opened egglike at the back mucked with thick blood blood trickling from his mouth his last words were “ prince your trumpeter has lost his breath. ” “ our worst fear was his face would fade ” teléspiax ’ s father said “ but it did not we will remember it until we die. ” “ give his instrument to hogem ” hector said and went— lutie on reins—between the sea and snow throwing his chariots wide scamánderwards as easily as others might a cloak diomed among this traffic on his own among his dead their pools of blood their cut-off body-parts their cut-off heads ashamed as his head cleared to see odysseus idomeneo the ajax—big and small— whipping away downslope shouting towards odysseus “ where are you going with your back to the battle ” who shouted back although he did not turn “ look left ” and there was lutie driving hector onto him sure they would trample him for sure queen hera ’ s human diomed would stand and die except “ arms up young king— ” nestor full tilt reins round his tummy leaning out “ —and jump ” wrists locked “ you young are just ” swinging him up onto the plate “ too much. ” “ with your permission da ” nod drew then threw the chariot ’ s javelin as lutie spun his wheels and hector threw— those skewers trading brilliance as they passed— and missed—both vehicles slither-straightening regaining speed close close then driven apart by empty cars careering off the incline or stationary cars their horses cropping grass “ daddy go slow hector will say i ran. ” “ but not the widows you have made. ” and slow and low cruising the blue above this mix heaven ’ s queen and ringsight-eyed athena trumpeting down huge worms of sound as hector ’ s car rereached king nestor ’ s and “ what kept you prince ” diomed offered as they came abreast “ you went for a refreshing towel ” and threw his axe that toppled through the air and oh hector my hector as you thought “ if heaven helps me heaven shows it loves the best ” parted your lutie ’ s mesh and smashed into his heart what did you say as god called you to death dear lutie “ king prince i leave you driverless. ” and put the reins into his hands and fled into oblivion as hector with his other hand held what his lutie was upright face forwards in between the chariot ’ s basket and himself shouting as he drove after them “ loathsome greek your loathsome hair your loathsome blood your loathsome breath your loathsome heart jump in your loathsome ships i will come after you come over the aegean after you and find you though you hide inside your loathsome father ’ s grave and with my bare hands twist your loathsome head off your loathsome neck. ” there was a greek called themion mad about armour if not armour cars of course he went to troy and troy saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove companionably his horses galloped up on starlight ’ s side and muddled starlight down and bertie down and brought the prince still holding lutie down as all the world hurried as if by windheads on towards scamánder ’ s ford hether you reach it from the palisade or through the trees that dot the incline ’ s last stretch you hear scamánder ’ s voice before you see what one may talk across on quiet days its rippling sunspangled breadth streaming across the bars of pebbly sand that form its ford —though on the fleet ’ s side deeper darkly bright and here tiptoeing from this bar to that settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair her towel retained by nothing save herself the god of tops and thongs our lady aphrodité came her eyes brimfull with tears scamánder is astonished by his luck “ beauty of beauties why are you weeping ” “ i have been hurt scamánder. ” “ no ” “ humiliated. ” “ no ” “ me a god just like yourself touched ” “ touched ” “ by a man. ” “ a man ” “ a greek. ” “ death to all greeks ” “ he cut me ” “ sacrilege but where ” “ i need your healing touch. ” “ how can i help you if you do not show me where ” “ moisten its lips and my wound will be healed. ” “ you must say where ” “ well ” the towel has slipped an inch “ i am afraid you will be disappointed. ” “ never. ” “ are you sure ” “ yes ” “ you will not criticize me ” “ no ” her wrist upturned out-turned her opened palm fanning the fingers of her other hand stroking his spangles with her fingertips “ goddess i love you i have always loved you say that you love me even a little i beg you god grant it. ” “ i need your help scamánder. ” “ take pity on me come into me. ” “ you have your nymphs. ” “ bores bores ” “ i might be nibbled by an eel ” “ death to all eels ” the towel is down “ step into me i love your toes please let me kiss your toes your little dinkum-inkum toes ” “ no one has kissed them so nicely scamánder. ” “ and now your knees ” “ you tickle me ” “ and now your thighs ” “ oh oh go on ” “ and now your bum your holy bum your sacred bum the bum of paradise ” “ oh my scamánder i must have your help ” “ anything ” the towel goes curling off and as she floated on his stream our lady aphrodité said “ at any moment now the greeks will reach your troy-side bank ” recall those sequences when horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a stream somewhere in kansas or missouri say so—save they were thousands—greece into scamánder ’ s ford coming downstream a smallish wave that passes but scamánder ’ s flow does not relapse indeed almost without a sound its murmuring radiance rose into a dark torrential surge clouded with boulders crammed with trees as clamorous as if it were a sea that lifted greece then pulled greece down cars gone masks gone gone under reappearing gone “ onto your knees praise hector for this flood the prince god loves ” prince hector claims as he comes through the trees they do then up and run run thousands of them to hold those greeks who got back out under until their bubbles stopped while those swept off turned somersaults amid scamánder ’ s undertow the flat— 1000 yards of it between the river and the palisade the king “ the lord has not abandoned us to cross will be as bad for them. ” but it was not to be as bad for them indeed as hector drove towards scamánder ’ s brink and as—their banners rising one by one one after one and then another one— he and all ilium began to enter it the river reassumed its softly-spoken smooth sunspangled way and agamemnon cried “ god what are you for what use are you to me ” as hector cries “ two miracles your prince is close to god ” and hera to athena “ fog ” and fog came down and most of greece got out troy holding hands midstream an army peering through its masks miss tops and thongs to god “ your hera has ” and with a wish he turned the fog to light and with a word he called them back to heaven sky snow the 1000 yards the palisade hector “ i am your prince my name means he-who-holds troy and the plain and now the ships for troy ” his battle cry rising into a common cry that cry into a clamour and that clamour to bayings of hatred 800 yards the child “ we are the greeks we fight to win if one is lost close his eyes step over him and kill his enemy. ” 800 yards the greeks are tiring nestor is on his knees “ god of all gods most holy and most high if greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you protect our ships. ” heaven soft music summertime queen hera and athena yes some lesser gods observing their approach approach salaam and then lead them— now both in black wraparound tops— to god “ darling daddy here we are. ” “ and ” hera “ here we stay until you stop that worthless hector killing greeks. ” up steps love hera “ why is she wearing a tent ” love “ father see this. ” her wrist “ human strikes god communism the end of everything ” “ darlings ” he said “ you know that being a god means being blamed do this—no good do that—the same the answer is avoid humanity remember—i am god i see the bigger picture. ” “ and i am hera heaven ’ s queen greece worships me. ” “ stuff greece ” love said “ your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples hates troy because troy ’ s paris put her last when we stripped off for him as for the ithacan boat-boy ’ s undercurved preceptatrix she hates troy because my statue stands on its acropolis. ” hera “ the cities ’ whores were taxed to pay for it. ” love dropping onto her knees before himself “ please stop them harming troy the greatest city in the world. ” while hera and athena sang “ cleavage cleavage queen of the foaming hole mammoth or man or midge she sucks from pole to pole. ” and god has had enough of it lifting his scales he said “ hector will have his day of victory. ” then crashed them to the ground 700 yards the palisade its gate late sunlight on gilt beaks “ there ’ s no escape from troy. ” “ or from the plain at troy. ” begging for ransom trojan hoti his arms around king menelaos ’ knees king agamemnon “ off. ” then he punched hoti in the face then punched him in the face again and then again and when he fell king agamemnon kicked him in the groin kicking him in the groin with so much force it took a step to follow up each kick then pulled him up then dragged him by his hair this way and that then left him calling “ finish him off. ” and someone did “ i was sixteen i said ‘ where is achilles ’ hard as it is to share another ’ s troubles when your own are pressing great ajax took my hands in his and said ‘ he loves us he is with us he will come. ’ ” but he did not then ajax to himself “ dear lord you made me straight give me the strength to last till dark. ” the prince “ i get past everything i see their war is lost. ” it was aenéas ábassee sarpédon gray calling to one another down the line then with a mighty wall of sound as if a slope of stones rolled down into a lake of broken glass we ran at them and now the light of evening has begun to shawl across the plain blue gray gold gray blue gold translucent nothingnesses readying our space within the deep unchanging sea of space for hesper ’ s entrance and the silver wrap covered with blood mostly their own loyal to death reckoning to die odysseus ajax diomed idomeneo nestor menelaos and the king “ do not die because others have died. ” “ do not show them the palms of your hands. ” “ achil ” “ achil ” “ if he won ’ t help us heaven help us. ” “ stand still and fight. ” “ feel shame in one another ’ s eyes. ” “ i curse you god you are a liar god troy will be yours by dark—immortal lies. ” “ home ” “ home ” “ there ’ s no such place. ” “ you can ’ t launch burning ships. ” “ more men survive if no one runs. ” but that is what greece did dropping their wounded throwing down their dead their shields their spears their swords they ran leaving their heroes tattered filthy torn and ran and ran above their cries “ i am the prince the victory is mine ” chylábborak “ do not take cowardice for granted. ” scarce had he said it when his son kykéon standing next to him took ajax ’ final spear cast in his chest “ i shall not wear your armour sir ” he said and died “ my son is dead. ” the prince “ hector is loved by god. ” and greece a wall of walking swords but walking backwards leaving the plain in silence and in tears idomeneo running back out at those trojans who came too close “ you know my name come look for me and boy the day you do will be the day you die. ” hector to troy “ soldiers — unmatched my force unconquerable my will after ten years of days in one long day to be remembered for as many days as there are days to come this is my day your hector ’ s day troy given back to troy my day of victory ” and when the cheering died “ some say destroy greece now but i say no out of your cars eat by your fires two hundred fires around each fire five hundred men “ the sound of grindstones turning through the night the firelight that stands between our blades so let king agamemnon ’ s own hold hands and look into each other ’ s frightened eyes “ true god great master of the widespread sky if only you would turn me into a god as you through me tomorrow by their ships will see greece die. ” silence a ring of lights within immaculate in boat-cloaks lined with red king agamemnon ’ s lords— the depression of retreat the depression of returning to camp him at the centre of their circle sobbing then shouting “ we must run for it ” dark glasses in parked cars “ king agamemnon of mycenae god called god raised god recognized you are a piece of shit ” diomed said silence again “ let us praise god ” lord ajax said “ that hector stopped before he reached the ships. ” silence again then nestor putting his knee back in “ paramount agamemnon king of kings lord of the shore the islands and the sea i shall begin and end with you greece needs good words like them or not the credit will be yours determined keen to fight that is our diomed— as i should know when just a boy of ten i fought blowback of missolonghi a cannibal drank blood

“ and now you must appease him agamemnon humble words hands shaken gifts. ” the king—wiping his eyes “ as usual pylos has said the only things worth hearing i was mad to take the she i shall pay fitting damages plus her i offer him the corfiot armour that my father wore. ” silence the sea its whispering “ to which i add a set of shields posy standard ceremonial the last cut from the hide of a one ton lesbian bull. ” silence the sea “ and a chariot from my own équipe they smoke along the ground they ride its undulations like a breeze ” the sea “ plus six horses—saddled bridled and caparisoned their grooms and veterinarians and six tall shes two good dancers two good stitchers two good cooks all capable of bearing boys “ oh very well then twenty loaves of gold the same of silver

the starlight on the sea the sea its whispering mixed with the prayers of ajax and of nestor as they walk along the shore towards achilles ’ gate “ my lords ” “ your lord. ” “ this way. ” they find him with guitar singing of gilgamesh “ take my hands here they are. ” you can not take your eyes away from him his own so bright they slow you down his voice so low and yet so clear you know that he

greatest benefaction ever known take it and fight or else hector will burn the ships then kill us randomly remember what your father said the day when ajax and myself drove up to ask if you could come with us to troy that you should stand among the blades where honour grows and secondly to let your anger go spirit and strength and beauty have combined such awesome power in you a vacant heaven would offer you its throne think of what those who will come after us will say save us from hector ’ s god from hector and from hector ’ s force i go down on my knees to you achilles. ” “ i must admire your courage father friend for treating me as if i was a fool i shall deal with hector as i want to you and your fellow countrymen will die for how your king has treated me i have spent five years fighting

that i got her courtesy of him she joined my stock in recognition of my strength my courage my superiority courtesy of yourselves my lords i will not fight for him he aims to personalise my loss briseis taken from achilles—standard practice helen from menelaos—war lord busy busy building his palisade mounting my she one that i might have picked to run my house raising her to the status of a wife do i hate him yes i hate him hate him and should he be afraid of me he should i want to harm him i want him to feel pain in his body and between his ears i must admit some of the things that you have said are true but look what he has done to me to me the king on whom his kingliness depends i will not fight for him hearing your steps i thought at last my friends have come to visit me they took their time about it true— after he took my she none of you came— now though—admittedly they are in trouble serious trouble—they have arrived as friends and of their own accord but you have not come here as friends and you have not come of your own accord you came because your king told you to come you came because i am his last resort and incidentally your last resort at least he offers stuff all you have offered is advice ‘ keep your temper mind your tongue think what the world will say ’ no mention of your king ’ s treatment of me no sign of love for me behind your tears i will not fight for him i can remember very well indeed the day you two grand lords came visiting my father ’ s house how i ran out to you and took your hands— the greatest men that i had ever seen ajax my

abou ben adhem may his tribe increase awoke one night from a deep dream of peace and saw within the moonlight in his room making it rich and like a lily in bloom an angel writing in a book of gold — exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold and to the presence in the room he said '' what writest thou `` —the vision raised its head and with a look made of all sweet accord answered `` the names of those who love the lord '' `` and is mine one '' said abou `` nay not so '' replied the angel abou spoke more low but cheerly still and said `` i pray thee then write me as one that loves his fellow men '' the angel wrote and vanished the next night it came again with a great wakening light and showed the names whom love of god had blest and lo ben adhem 's name led all the rest
in pious times ere priest-craft did begin before polygamy was made a sin when man on many multipli 'd his kind ere one to one was cursedly confin 'd when nature prompted and no law deni'd promiscuous use of concubine and bride then israel 's monarch after heaven 's own heart his vigorous warmth did variously impart to wives and slaves and wide as his command scatter 'd his maker 's image through the land michal of royal blood the crown did wear a soil ungrateful to the tiller 's care not so the rest for several mothers bore to god-like david several sons before but since like slaves his bed they did ascend no true succession could their seed attend of all this numerous progeny was none so beautiful so brave as absalom whether inspir 'd by some diviner lust his father got him with a greater gust or that his conscious destiny made way by manly beauty to imperial sway early in foreign fields he won renown with kings and states alli 'd to israel 's crown in peace the thoughts of war he could remove and seem 'd as he were only born for love whate'er he did was done with so much ease in him alone 't was natural to please his motions all accompani 'd with grace and paradise was open 'd in his face with secret joy indulgent david view'd his youthful image in his son renew 'd to all his wishes nothing he deni 'd and made the charming annabel his bride what faults he had for who from faults is free his father could not or he would not see some warm excesses which the law forbore were constru 'd youth that purged by boiling o'er and amnon 's murther by a specious name was call 'd a just revenge for injur 'd fame thus prais 'd and lov 'd the noble youth remain 'd while david undisturb 'd in sion reign 'd but life can never be sincerely blest heav'n punishes the bad and proves the best the jews a headstrong moody murm'ring race as ever tri 'd th'extent and stretch of grace god 's pamper 'd people whom debauch 'd with ease no king could govern nor no god could please gods they had tri 'd of every shape and size that god-smiths could produce or priests devise these adam-wits too fortunately free began to dream they wanted liberty and when no rule no precedent was found of men by laws less circumscrib 'd and bound they led their wild desires to woods and caves and thought that all but savages were slaves they who when saul was dead without a blow made foolish ishbosheth the crown forego who banisht david did from hebron bring and with a general shout proclaim 'd him king those very jews who at their very best their humour more than loyalty exprest now wonder 'd why so long they had obey'd an idol-monarch which their hands had made thought they might ruin him they could create or melt him to that golden calf a state but these were random bolts no form 'd design nor interest made the factious crowd to join the sober part of israel free from stain well knew the value of a peaceful reign and looking backward with a wise afright saw seams of wounds dishonest to the sight in contemplation of whose ugly scars they curst the memory of civil wars the moderate sort of men thus qualifi 'd inclin 'd the balance to the better side and david 's mildness manag 'd it so well the bad found no occasion to rebel but when to sin our bias 'd nature leans the careful devil is still at hand with means and providently pimps for ill desires the good old cause reviv 'd a plot requires plots true or false are necessary things to raise up common-wealths and ruin kings th inhabitants of old jerusalem were jebusites the town so call 'd from them and theirs the native right— but when the chosen people grew more strong the rightful cause at length became the wrong and every loss the men of jebus bore they still were thought god 's enemies the more thus worn and weaken 'd well or ill content submit they must to david 's government impoverish 'd and depriv 'd of all command their taxes doubled as they lost their land and what was harder yet to flesh and blood their gods disgrac 'd and burnt like common wood this set the heathen priesthood in a flame for priests of all religions are the same of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be stock stone or other homely pedigree in his defence his servants are as bold as if he had been born of beaten gold the jewish rabbins though their enemies in this conclude them honest men and wise for 't was their duty all the learned think t'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink from hence began that plot the nation 's curse bad in itself but represented worse rais 'd in extremes and in extremes decri 'd with oaths affirm 'd with dying vows deni 'd not weigh 'd or winnow 'd by the multitude but swallow 'd in the mass unchew 'd and crude some truth there was but dash 'd and brew 'd with lies to please the fools and puzzle all the wise succeeding times did equal folly call believing nothing or believing all th egyptian rites the jebusites embrac 'd where gods were recommended by their taste such sav'ry deities must needs be good as serv 'd at once for worship and for food by force they could not introduce these gods for ten to one in former days was odds so fraud was us 'd the sacrificers trade fools are more hard to conquer than persuade their busy teachers mingled with the jews and rak 'd for converts even the court and stews which hebrew priests the more unkindly took because the fleece accompanies the flock some thought they god 's anointed meant to slay by guns invented since full many a day our author swears it not but who can know how far the devil and jebusites may go this plot which fail 'd for want of common sense had yet a deep and dangerous consequence for as when raging fevers boil the blood the standing lake soon floats into a flood and ev'ry hostile humour which before slept quiet in its channels bubbles o'er so several factions from this first ferment work up to foam and threat the government some by their friends more by themselves thought wise oppos 'd the pow'r to which they could not rise some had in courts been great and thrown from thence like fiends were harden 'd in impenitence some by their monarch 's fatal mercy grown from pardon 'd rebels kinsmen to the throne were rais 'd in pow'r and public office high strong bands if bands ungrateful men could tie of these the false achitophel was first a name to all succeeding ages curst for close designs and crooked counsels fit sagacious bold and turbulent of wit restless unfixt in principles and place in pow'r unpleas 'd impatient of disgrace a fiery soul which working out its way fretted the pigmy-body to decay and o'er inform 'd the tenement of clay a daring pilot in extremity pleas 'd with the danger when the waves went high he sought the storms but for a calm unfit would steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit great wits are sure to madness near alli 'd and thin partitions do their bounds divide else why should he with wealth and honour blest refuse his age the needful hours of rest punish a body which he could not please bankrupt of life yet prodigal of ease and all to leave what with his toil he won to that unfeather 'd two-legg 'd thing a son got while his soul did huddled notions try and born a shapeless lump like anarchy in friendship false implacable in hate resolv 'd to ruin or to rule the state to compass this the triple bond he broke the pillars of the public safety shook and fitted israel for a foreign yoke then seiz 'd with fear yet still affecting fame usurp 'd a patriot 's all-atoning name so easy still it proves in factious times with public zeal to cancel private crimes how safe is treason and how sacred ill where none can sin against the people 's will where crowds can wink and no offence be known since in another 's guilt they find their own yet fame deserv 'd no enemy can grudge the statesman we abhor but praise the judge in jewish courts ne'er sat an abbethdin with more discerning eyes or hands more clean unbrib 'd unsought the wretched to redress swift of dispatch and easy of access oh had he been content to serve the crown with virtues only proper to the gown or had the rankness of the soil been freed from cockle that opprest the noble seed david for him his tuneful harp had strung and heav'n had wanted one immortal song but wild ambition loves to slide not stand and fortune 's ice prefers to virtue 's land achitophel grown weary to possess a lawful fame and lazy happiness disdain 'd the golden fruit to gather free and lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree now manifest of crimes contriv 'd long since he stood at bold defiance with his prince held up the buckler of the people 's cause against the crown and skulk 'd behind the laws the wish 'd occasion of the plot he takes some circumstances finds but more he makes by buzzing emissaries fills the ears of list'ning crowds with jealousies and fears of arbitrary counsels brought to light and proves the king himself a jebusite weak arguments which yet he knew full well were strong with people easy to rebel for govern 'd by the moon the giddy jews tread the same track when she the prime renews and once in twenty years their scribes record by natural instinct they change their lord achitophel still wants a chief and none was found so fit as warlike absalom not that he wish 'd his greatness to create for politicians neither love nor hate but for he knew his title not allow 'd would keep him still depending on the crowd that kingly pow'r thus ebbing out might be drawn to the dregs of a democracy him he attempts with studied arts to please and sheds his venom in such words as these auspicious prince at whose nativity some royal planet rul 'd the southern sky thy longing country 's darling and desire their cloudy pillar and their guardian fire their second moses whose extended wand divides the seas and shows the promis 'd land whose dawning day in very distant age has exercis 'd the sacred prophet 's rage the people 's pray'r the glad diviner 's theme the young men 's vision and the old men 's dream thee saviour thee the nation 's vows confess and never satisfi 'd with seeing bless swift unbespoken pomps thy steps proclaim and stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name how long wilt thou the general joy detain starve and defraud the people of thy reign content ingloriously to pass thy days like one of virtue 's fools that feeds on praise till thy fresh glories which now shine so bright grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight believe me royal youth thy fruit must be or gather 'd ripe or rot upon the tree heav'n has to all allotted soon or late some lucky revolution of their fate whose motions if we watch and guide with skill for human good depends on human will our fortune rolls as from a smooth descent and from the first impression takes the bent but if unseiz 'd she glides away like wind and leaves repenting folly far behind now now she meets you with a glorious prize and spreads her locks before her as she flies had thus old david from whose loins you spring not dar 'd when fortune call 'd him to be king at gath an exile he might still remain and heaven 's anointing oil had been in vain let his successful youth your hopes engage but shun th'example of declining age behold him setting in his western skies the shadows lengthening as the vapours rise he is not now as when on jordan 's sand the joyful people throng 'd to see him land cov'ring the beach and black'ning all the strand but like the prince of angels from his height comes tumbling downward with diminish 'd light betray 'd by one poor plot to public scorn our only blessing since his curst return those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind blown off and scatter 'd by a puff of wind what strength can he to your designs oppose naked of friends and round beset with foes if pharaoh 's doubtful succour he should use a foreign aid would more incense the jews proud egypt would dissembled friendship bring foment the war but not support the king nor would the royal party e'er unite with pharaoh 's arms t'assist the jebusite or if they should their interest soon would break and with such odious aid make david weak all sorts of men by my successful arts abhorring kings estrange their alter 'd hearts from david 's rule and 't is the general cry religion common-wealth and liberty if you as champion of the public good add to their arms a chief of royal blood what may not israel hope and what applause might such a general gain by such a cause not barren praise alone that gaudy flow'r fair only to the sight but solid pow'r and nobler is a limited command giv'n by the love of all your native land than a successive title long and dark drawn from the mouldy rolls of noah 's ark what can not praise effect in mighty minds when flattery soothes and when ambition blinds desire of pow'r on earth a vicious weed yet sprung from high is of celestial seed in god 't is glory and when men aspire 'tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire th ambitious youth too covetous of fame too full of angel 's metal in his frame unwarily was led from virtue 's ways made drunk with honour and debauch 'd with praise half loath and half consenting to the ill for loyal blood within him struggled still he thus repli'd.—and what pretence have i to take up arms for public liberty my father governs with unquestion 'd right the faith 's defender and mankind 's delight good gracious just observant of the laws and heav'n by wonders has espous 'd his cause whom has he wrong 'd in all his peaceful reign who sues for justice to his throne in vain what millions has he pardon 'd of his foes whom just revenge did to his wrath expose mild easy humble studious of our good inclin 'd to mercy and averse from blood if mildness ill with stubborn israel suit his crime is god 's beloved attribute what could he gain his people to betray or change his right for arbitrary sway let haughty pharaoh curse with such a reign his fruitful nile and yoke a servile train if david 's rule jerusalem displease the dog-star heats their brains to this disease why then should i encouraging the bad turn rebel and run popularly mad were he a tyrant who by lawless might oppress 'd the jews and rais 'd the jebusite well might i mourn but nature 's holy bands would curb my spirits and restrain my hands the people might assert their liberty but what was right in them were crime in me his favour leaves me nothing to require prevents my wishes and out-runs desire what more can i expect while david lives all but his kingly diadem he gives and that but there he paus 'd then sighing said is justly destin 'd for a worthier head for when my father from his toils shall rest and late augment the number of the blest his lawful issue shall the throne ascend or the collat'ral line where that shall end his brother though oppress 'd with vulgar spite yet dauntless and secure of native right of every royal virtue stands possess 'd still dear to all the bravest and the best his courage foes his friends his truth proclaim his loyalty the king the world his fame his mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find for sure he comes of a forgiving kind why should i then repine at heaven 's decree which gives me no pretence to royalty yet oh that fate propitiously inclin 'd had rais 'd my birth or had debas 'd my mind to my large soul not all her treasure lent and then betray 'd it to a mean descent i find i find my mounting spirits bold and david 's part disdains my mother 's mold why am i scanted by a niggard-birth my soul disclaims the kindred of her earth and made for empire whispers me within desire of greatness is a god-like sin him staggering so when hell 's dire agent found while fainting virtue scarce maintain 'd her ground he pours fresh forces in and thus replies th'eternal god supremely good and wise imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain what wonders are reserv 'd to bless your reign against your will your arguments have shown such virtue 's only giv'n to guide a throne not that your father 's mildness i contemn but manly force becomes the diadem 't is true he grants the people all they crave and more perhaps than subjects ought to have for lavish grants suppose a monarch tame and more his goodness than his wit proclaim but when should people strive their bonds to break if not when kings are negligent or weak let him give on till he can give no more the thrifty sanhedrin shall keep him poor and every shekel which he can receive shall cost a limb of his prerogative to ply him with new plots shall be my care or plunge him deep in some expensive war which when his treasure can no more supply he must with the remains of kingship buy his faithful friends our jealousies and fears call jebusites and pharaoh 's pensioners whom when our fury from his aid has torn he shall be naked left to public scorn the next successor whom i fear and hate my arts have made obnoxious to the state turn 'd all his virtues to his overthrow and gain 'd our elders to pronounce a foe his right for sums of necessary gold shall first be pawn 'd and afterwards be sold till time shall ever-wanting david draw to pass your doubtful title into law if not the people have a right supreme to make their kings for kings are made for them all empire is no more than pow'r in trust which when resum 'd can be no longer just succession for the general good design 'd in its own wrong a nation can not bind if altering that the people can relieve better one suffer than a nation grieve the jews well know their pow'r ere saul they chose god was their king and god they durst depose urge now your piety your filial name a father 's right and fear of future fame the public good the universal call to which even heav'n submitted answers all nor let his love enchant your generous mind 'tis nature 's trick to propagate her kind our fond begetters who would never die love but themselves in their posterity or let his kindness by th'effects be tri 'd or let him lay his vain pretence aside god said he lov 'd your father could he bring a better proof than to anoint him king it surely show 'd he lov 'd the shepherd well who gave so fair a flock as israel would david have you thought his darling son what means he then to alienate the crown the name of godly he may blush to bear 'tis after god 's own heart to cheat his heir he to his brother gives supreme command to you a legacy of barren land perhaps th'old harp on which he thrums his lays or some dull hebrew ballad in your praise then the next heir a prince severe and wise already looks on you with jealous eyes sees through the thin disguises of your arts and marks your progress in the people 's hearts though now his mighty soul in grief contains he meditates revenge who least complains and like a lion slumb'ring in the way or sleep-dissembling while he waits his prey his fearless foes within his distance draws constrains his roaring and contracts his paws till at the last his time for fury found he shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground the prostrate vulgar passes o'er and spares but with a lordly rage his hunters tears your case no tame expedients will afford resolve on death or conquest by the sword which for no less a stake than life you draw and self-defence is nature 's eldest law leave the warm people no considering time for then rebellion may be thought a crime prevail yourself of what occasion gives but try your title while your father lives and that your arms may have a fair pretence proclaim you take them in the king 's defence whose sacred life each minute would expose to plots from seeming friends and secret foes and who can sound the depth of david 's soul perhaps his fear his kindness may control he fears his brother though he loves his son for plighted vows too late to be undone if so by force he wishes to be gain 'd like women 's lechery to seem constrain 'd doubt not but when he most affects the frown commit a pleasing rape upon the crown secure his person to secure your cause they who possess the prince possess the laws he said and this advice above the rest with absalom 's mild nature suited best unblam 'd of life ambition set aside not stain 'd with cruelty nor puff 'd with pride how happy had he been if destiny had higher plac 'd his birth or not so high his kingly virtues might have claim 'd a throne and blest all other countries but his own but charming greatness since so few refuse 'tis juster to lament him than accuse strong were his hopes a rival to remove with blandishments to gain the public love to head the faction while their zeal was hot and popularly prosecute the plot to farther this achitophel unites the malcontents of all the israelites whose differing parties he could wisely join for several ends to serve the same design the best and of the princes some were such who thought the pow'r of monarchy too much mistaken men and patriots in their hearts not wicked but seduc 'd by impious arts by these the springs of property were bent and wound so high they crack 'd the government the next for interest sought t'embroil the state to sell their duty at a dearer rate and make their jewish markets of the throne pretending public good to serve their own others thought kings an useless heavy load who cost too much and did too little good these were for laying honest david by on principles of pure good husbandry with them join 'd all th'haranguers of the throng that thought to get preferment by the tongue who follow next a double danger bring not only hating david but the king the solymaean rout well vers 'd of old in godly faction and in treason bold cow'ring and quaking at a conqu'ror 's sword but lofty to a lawful prince restor 'd saw with disdain an ethnic plot begun and scorn 'd by jebusites to be out-done hot levites headed these who pull 'd before from th'ark which in the judges days they bore resum 'd their cant and with a zealous cry pursu 'd their old belov 'd theocracy where sanhedrin and priest enslav 'd the nation and justifi 'd their spoils by inspiration for who so fit for reign as aaron 's race if once dominion they could found in grace these led the pack though not of surest scent yet deepest mouth 'd against the government a numerous host of dreaming saints succeed of the true old enthusiastic breed 'gainst form and order they their pow'r employ nothing to build and all things to destroy but far more numerous was the herd of such who think too little and who talk too much these out of mere instinct they knew not why ador 'd their father 's god and property and by the same blind benefit of fate the devil and the jebusite did hate born to be saved even in their own despite because they could not help believing right such were the tools but a whole hydra more remains of sprouting heads too long to score some of their chiefs were princes of the land in the first rank of these did zimri stand a man so various that he seem 'd to be not one but all mankind 's epitome stiff in opinions always in the wrong was everything by starts and nothing long but in the course of one revolving moon was chemist fiddler statesman and buffoon then all for women painting rhyming drinking besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking blest madman who could every hour employ with something new to wish or to enjoy railing and praising were his usual themes and both to show his judgment in extremes so over violent or over civil that every man with him was god or devil in squandering wealth was his peculiar art nothing went unrewarded but desert beggar 'd by fools whom still he found too late he had his jest and they had his estate he laugh 'd himself from court then sought relief by forming parties but could ne'er be chief for spite of him the weight of business fell on absalom and wise achitophel thus wicked but in will of means bereft he left not faction but of that was left titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse of lords below the dignity of verse wits warriors commonwealths-men were the best kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest and therefore in the name of dullness be the well-hung balaam and cold caleb free and canting nadab let oblivion damn who made new porridge for the paschal lamb let friendship 's holy band some names assure some their own worth and some let scorn secure nor shall the rascal rabble here have place whom kings no titles gave and god no grace not bull-faced jonas who could statutes draw to mean rebellion and make treason law but he though bad is follow 'd by a worse the wretch who heav'n 's anointed dar 'd to curse shimei whose youth did early promise bring of zeal to god and hatred to his king did wisely from expensive sins refrain and never broke the sabbath but for gain nor ever was he known an oath to vent or curse unless against the government thus heaping wealth by the most ready way among the jews which was to cheat and pray the city to reward his pious hate against his master chose him magistrate his hand a vare of justice did uphold his neck was loaded with a chain of gold during his office treason was no crime the sons of belial had a glorious time for shimei though not prodigal of pelf yet lov 'd his wicked neighbour as himself when two or three were gather 'd to declaim against the monarch of jerusalem shimei was always in the midst of them and if they curst the king when he was by would rather curse than break good company if any durst his factious friends accuse he pack 'd a jury of dissenting jews whose fellow-feeling in the godly cause would free the suff'ring saint from human laws for laws are only made to punish those who serve the king and to protect his foes if any leisure time he had from pow'r because 't is sin to mis-employ an hour his bus'ness was by writing to persuade that kings were useless and a clog to trade and that his noble style he might refine no rechabite more shunn 'd the fumes of wine chaste were his cellars and his shrieval board the grossness of a city feast abhorr 'd his cooks with long disuse their trade forgot cool was his kitchen though his brains were hot such frugal virtue malice may accuse but sure 't was necessary to the jews for towns once burnt such magistrates require as dare not tempt god 's providence by fire with spiritual food he fed his servants well but free from flesh that made the jews rebel and moses laws he held in more account for forty days of fasting in the mount to speak the rest who better are forgot would tire a well-breath 'd witness of the plot yet corah thou shalt from oblivion pass erect thyself thou monumental brass high as the serpent of thy metal made while nations stand secure beneath thy shade what though his birth were base yet comets rise from earthy vapours e'er they shine in skies prodigious actions may as well be done by weaver 's issue as by prince 's son this arch-attestor for the public good by that one deed ennobles all his blood who ever ask 'd the witnesses high race whose oath with martyrdom did stephen grace ours was a levite and as times went then his tribe were god-almighty 's gentlemen sunk

his writ apocryphal our laws for such affronts have forfeits made he takes his life who takes away his trade were i myself in witness corah 's place the wretch who did me such a dire disgrace should

looks his gestures and his words he frames and with familiar ease repeats their names thus form 'd by nature furnish 'd out with arts he glides unfelt into their secret hearts then with a kind compassionating look and sighs bespeaking pity e'er he spoke few words he said but easy those and fit more slow than hybla drops and far more sweet i mourn my country-men your lost estate though far unable to prevent your fate behold a banish 'd man for your dear cause expos 'd a prey to arbitrary laws yet oh that i alone could be undone cut off from empire and no more a son now all your liberties a spoil are made egypt and tyrus intercept your trade and jebusites your sacred rites invade my father whom with reverence yet i name charm 'd into ease is careless of his fame and brib 'd with petty sums of foreign gold is grown in bathsheba 's embraces old exalts his enemies his friends destroys and all his pow'r against himself employs he gives and let him give my right away but why should he his own and yours betray he only he can make the nation bleed and he alone from my revenge is freed take then my tears with that he wip 'd his eyes 'tis all the aid my present pow'r supplies no court-informer can these arms accuse these arms may sons against their fathers use and 't is my wish the next successor 's reign may make no other israelite complain youth beauty graceful action seldom fail but common interest always will prevail and pity never ceases to be shown to him who makes the people 's wrongs his own the crowd that still believe their kings oppress with lifted hands their young messiah bless who now begins his progress to ordain with chariots horsemen and a num'rous train from east to west his glories he displays and like the sun the promis 'd land surveys fame runs before him as the morning-star and shouts of joy salute him from afar each house receives him as a guardian god and consecrates the place of his abode but hospitable treats did most commend wise issachar his wealthy western friend this moving court that caught the people 's eyes and seem 'd but pomp did other ends disguise achitophel had form 'd it with intent to sound the depths and fathom where it went the people 's hearts distinguish friends from foes and try their strength before they came to blows yet all was colour 'd with a smooth pretence of specious love and duty to their prince religion and redress of grievances two names that always cheat and always please are often urg 'd and good king david 's life endanger 'd by a brother and a wife thus in a pageant show a plot is made and peace itself is war in masquerade oh foolish israel never warn 'd by ill still the same bait and circumvented still did ever men forsake their present ease in midst of health imagine a disease take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee make heirs for monarchs and for god decree what shall we think can people give away both for themselves and sons their native sway then they are left defenceless to the sword of each unbounded arbitrary lord and laws are vain by which we right enjoy if kings unquestion 'd can those laws destroy yet if the crowd be judge of fit and just and kings are only officers in trust then this resuming cov'nant was declar'd when kings were made or is for ever bar 'd if those who gave the sceptre could not tie by their own deed their own posterity how then could adam bind his future race how could his forfeit on mankind take place or how could heavenly justice damn us all who ne'er consented to our father 's fall then kings are slaves to those whom they command and tenants to their people 's pleasure stand add that the pow'r for property allow 'd is mischievously seated in the crowd for who can be secure of private right if sovereign sway may be dissolv 'd by might nor is the people 's judgment always true the most may err as grossly as the few and faultless kings run down by common cry for vice oppression and for tyranny what standard is there in a fickle rout which flowing to the mark runs faster out nor only crowds but sanhedrins may be infected with this public lunacy and share the madness of rebellious times to murther monarchs for imagin 'd crimes if they may give and take whene'er they please not kings alone the godhead 's images but government itself at length must fall to nature 's state where all have right to all yet grant our lords the people kings can make what prudent men a settled throne would shake for whatsoe'er their sufferings were before that change they covet makes them suffer more all other errors but disturb a state but innovation is the blow of fate if ancient fabrics nod and threat to fall to patch the flaws and buttress up the wall thus far 't is duty but here fix the mark for all beyond it is to touch our ark to change foundations cast the frame anew is work for rebels who base ends pursue at once divine and human laws control and mend the parts by ruin of the whole the tamp'ring world is subject to this curse to physic their disease into a worse now what relief can righteous david bring how fatal 't is to be too good a king friends he has few so high the madness grows who dare be such must be the people 's foes yet some there were ev'n in the worst of days some let me name and naming is to praise in this short file barzillai first appears barzillai crown 'd with honour and with years long since the rising rebels he withstood in regions waste beyond the jordan 's flood unfortunately brave to buoy the state but sinking underneath his master 's fate in exile with his god-like prince he mourn 'd for him he suffer 'd and with him return 'd the court he practis 'd not the courtier 's art large was his wealth but larger was his heart which well the noblest objects knew to choose the fighting warrior and recording muse his bed could once a fruitful issue boast now more than half a father 's name is lost his eldest hope with every grace adorn 'd by me so heav'n will have it always mourn 'd and always honour 'd snatch 'd in manhood 's prime b unequal fates and providence 's crime yet not before the goal of honour won all parts fulfill 'd of subject and of son swift was the race but short the time to run oh narrow circle but of pow'r divine scanted in space but perfect in thy line by sea by land thy matchless worth was known arms thy delight and war was all thy own thy force infus 'd the fainting tyrians propp 'd and haughty pharaoh found his fortune stopp 'd oh ancient honour oh unconquer 'd hand whom foes unpunish 'd never could withstand but israel was unworthy of thy name short is the date of all immoderate fame it looks as heav'n our ruin had design 'd and durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind now free from earth thy disencumber 'd soul mounts up and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole from thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring to aid the guardian angel of thy king here stop my muse here cease thy painful flight no pinions can pursue immortal height tell good barzillai thou canst sing no more and tell thy soul she should have fled before or fled she with his life and left this verse to hang on her departed patron 's hearse now take thy steepy flight from heav'n and see if thou canst find on earth another he another he would be too hard to find see then whom thou canst see not far behind zadoc the priest whom shunning pow'r and place his lowly mind advanc 'd to david 's grace with him the sagan of jerusalem of hospitable soul and noble stem him of the western dome whose weighty sense flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence the prophet 's sons by such example led to learning and to loyalty were bred for colleges on bounteous kings depend and never rebel was to arts a friend to these succeed the pillars of the laws who best could plead and best can judge a cause next them a train of loyal peers ascend sharp judging adriel the muse 's friend himself a muse —in sanhedrin 's debate true to his prince but not a slave of state whom david 's love with honours did adorn that from his disobedient son were torn jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought endow 'd by nature and by learning taught to move assemblies who but only tri'd the worse awhile then chose the better side nor chose alone but turn 'd the balance too so much the weight of one brave man can do hushai the friend of david in distress in public storms of manly steadfastness by foreign treaties he inform 'd his youth and join 'd experience to his native truth his frugal care suppli 'd the wanting throne frugal for that but bounteous of his own 'tis easy conduct when exchequers flow but hard the task to manage well the low for sovereign power is too depress 'd or high when kings are forc 'd to sell or crowds to buy indulge one labour more my weary muse for amiel who can amiel 's praise refuse of ancient race by birth but nobler yet in his own worth and without title great the sanhedrin long time as chief he rul 'd their reason guided and their passion cool 'd so dext'rous was he in the crown 's defence so form 'd to speak a loyal nation 's sense that as their band was israel 's tribes in small so fit was he to represent them all now rasher charioteers the seat ascend whose loose careers his steady skill commend they like th'unequal ruler of the day misguide the seasons and mistake the way while he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles and safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils these were the chief a small but faithful band of worthies in the breach who dar 'd to stand and tempt th'united fury of the land with grief they view 'd such powerful engines bent to batter down the lawful government a numerous faction with pretended frights in sanhedrins to plume the regal rights the true successor from the court remov 'd the plot by hireling witnesses improv 'd these ills they saw and as their duty bound they show 'd the king the danger of the wound that no concessions from the throne would please but lenitives fomented the disease that absalom ambitious of the crown was made the lure to draw the people down that false achitophel 's pernicious hate had turn 'd the plot to ruin church and state the council violent the rabble worse that shimei taught jerusalem to curse with all these loads of injuries opprest and long revolving in his careful breast th'event of things at last his patience tir 'd thus from his royal throne by heav'n inspir 'd the god-like david spoke and awful fear his train their maker in their master hear thus long have i by native mercy sway 'd my wrongs dissembl 'd my revenge delay 'd so willing to forgive th'offending age so much the father did the king assuage but now so far my clemency they slight th offenders question my forgiving right that one was made for many they contend but 't is to rule for that 's a monarch 's end they call my tenderness of blood my fear though manly tempers can the longest bear yet since they will divert my native course 'tis time to shew i am not good by force those heap 'd affronts that haughty subjects bring are burdens for a camel not a king kings are the public pillars of the state born to sustain and prop the nation 's weight if my young sampson will pretend a call to shake the column let him share the fall but oh that yet he would repent and live how easy 't is for parents to forgive with how few tears a pardon might be won from nature pleading for a darling son poor pitied youth by my paternal care rais 'd up to all the heights his frame could bear had god ordain 'd his fate for empire born he would have giv'n his soul another turn gull 'd with a patriot 's name whose modern sense is one that would by law supplant his prince the people 's brave the politician 's tool never was patriot yet but was a fool whence comes it that religion and the laws should more be absalom 's than david 's cause his old instructor e'er he lost his place was never thought endued with so much grace good heav'ns how faction can a patriot paint my rebel ever proves my people 's saint would they impose an heir upon the throne let sanhedrins be taught to give their own a king 's at least a part of government and mine as requisite as their consent without my leave a future king to choose infers a right the present to depose true they petition me t'approve their choice but esau 's hands suit ill with jacob 's voice my pious subjects for my safety pray which to secure they take my pow'r away from plots and treasons heav'n preserve my years but save me most from my petitioners unsatiate as the barren womb or grave god can not grant so much as they can crave what then is left but with a jealous eye to guard the small remains of royalty the law shall still direct my peaceful sway and the same law teach rebels to obey votes shall no more establish 'd pow'r control such votes as make a part exceed the whole no groundless clamours shall my friends remove nor crowds have pow'r to punish ere they prove for gods and god-like kings their care express still to defend their servants in distress oh that my pow'r to saving were confin 'd why am i forc 'd like heav'n against my mind to make examples of another kind must i at length the sword of justice draw oh curst effects of necessary law how ill my fear they by my mercy scan beware the fury of a patient man law they require let law then show her face they could not be content to look on grace her hinder parts but with a daring eye to tempt the terror of her front and die by their own arts 't is righteously decreed those dire artificers of death shall bleed against themselves their witnesses will swear till viper-like their mother plot they tear and suck for nutriment that bloody gore which was their principle of life before their belial with the belzebub will fight thus on my foes my foes shall do me right nor doubt th'event for factious crowds engage in their first onset all their brutal rage then let 'em take an unresisted course retire and traverse and delude their force but when they stand all breathless urge the fight and rise upon 'em with redoubled might for lawful pow'r is still superior found when long driv'n back at length it stands the ground he said th almighty nodding gave consent and peals of thunder shook the firmament henceforth a series of new time began the mighty years in long procession ran once more the god-like david was restor 'd and willing nations knew their lawful lord
would that the structure brave the manifold music i build bidding my organ obey calling its keys to their work claiming each slave of the sound at a touch as when solomon willed armies of angels that soar legions of demons that lurk man brute reptile fly —alien of end and of aim adverse each from the other heaven-high hell-deep removed — should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable name and pile him a palace straight to pleasure the princess he loved would it might tarry like his the beautiful building of mine this which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise ah one and all how they helped would dispart now and now combine zealous to hasten the work heighten their master his praise and one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell burrow awhile and build broad on the roots of things then up again swim into sight having based me my palace well founded it fearless of flame flat on the nether springs and another would mount and march like the excellent minion he was ay another and yet another one crowd but with many a crest raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass eager to do and die yield each his place to the rest for higher still and higher as a runner tips with fire when a great illumination surprises a festal night— outlining round and round rome 's dome from space to spire up the pinnacled glory reached and the pride of my soul was in sight in sight not half for it seemed it was certain to match man 's birth nature in turn conceived obeying an impulse as i and the emulous heaven yearned down made effort to reach the earth as the earth had done her best in my passion to scale the sky novel splendours burst forth grew familiar and dwelt with mine not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star meteor-moons balls of blaze and they did not pale nor pine for earth had attained to heaven there was no more near nor far nay more for there wanted not who walked in the glare and glow presences plain in the place or fresh from the protoplast furnished for ages to come when a kindlier wind should blow lured now to begin and live in a house to their liking at last or else the wonderful dead who have passed through the body and gone but were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new what never had been was now what was as it shall be anon and what is —shall i say matched both for i was made perfect too all through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul all through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth all through music and me for think had i painted the whole why there it had stood to see nor the process so wonder-worth had i written the same made verse—still effect proceeds from cause ye know why the forms are fair ye hear how the tale is told it is all triumphant art but art in obedience to laws painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled — but here is the finger of god a flash of the will that can existent behind all laws that made them and lo they are and i know not if save in this such gift be allowed to man that out of three sounds he frame not a fourth sound but a star consider it well each tone of our scale in itself is nought it is everywhere in the world—loud soft and all is said give it to me to use i mix it with two in my thought and there ye have heard and seen consider and bow the head well it is gone at last the palace of music i reared gone and the good tears start the praises that come too slow for one is assured at first one scarce can say that he feared that he even gave it a thought the gone thing was to go never to be again but many more of the kind as good nay better perchance is this your comfort to me to me who must be saved because i cling with my mind to the same same self same love same god ay what was shall be therefore to whom turn i but to thee the ineffable name builder and maker thou of houses not made with hands what have fear of change from thee who art ever the same doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands there shall never be one lost good what was shall live as before the evil is null is nought is silence implying sound what was good shall be good with for evil so much good more on the earth the broken arcs in the heaven a perfect round all we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist not its semblance but itself no beauty nor good nor power whose voice has gone forth but each survives for the melodist when eternity affirms the conception of an hour the high that proved too high the heroic for earth too hard the passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky are music sent up to god by the lover and the bard enough that he heard it once we shall hear it by and by and what is our failure here but a triumph 's evidence for the fulness of the days have we withered or agonized why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized sorrow is hard to bear and doubt is slow to clear each sufferer says his say his scheme of the weal and woe but god has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear the rest may reason and welcome 't is we musicians know well it is earth with me silence resumes her reign i will be patient and proud and soberly acquiesce give me the keys i feel for the common chord again sliding by semitones till i sink to the minor —yes and i blunt it into a ninth and i stand on alien ground surveying awhile the heights i rolled from into the deep which hark i have dared and done for my resting-place is found the c major of this life so now i will try to sleep
the non-action of the wise man is not inaction it is not studied it is not shaken by anything the sage is quiet because he is not moved not because he wills to be quiet still water is like glass you can look in it and see the bristles on your chin it is a perfect level a carpenter could use it if water is so clear so level how much more the spirit of man the heart of the wise man is tranquil it is the mirror of heaven and earth the glass of everything emptiness stillness tranquillity tastelessness silence non-action this is the level of heaven and earth this is perfect tao wise men find here their resting place resting they are empty from emptiness comes the unconditioned from this the conditioned the individual things so from the sage ’ s emptiness stillness arises from stillness action from action attainment from their stillness comes their non-action which is also action and is therefore their attainment for stillness is joy joy is free from care fruitful in long years joy does all things without concern for emptiness stillness tranquillity tastelessness silence and non-action are the root of all things
when the first dark had fallen around them and the leaves were weary of praise in the clear silence beauty found them and shewed them all her ways in the high noon of the heavenly garden where the angels sunned with the birds beauty before their hearts could harden had taught them heavenly words when they fled in the burning weather and nothing dawned but a dream beauty fasted their hands together and cooled them at her stream and when day wearied and night grew stronger and they slept as the beautiful must then she bided a little longer and blossomed from their dust

when first thou didst entice to thee my heart i thought the service brave so many joys i writ down for my part besides what i might have out of my stock of natural delights augmented with thy gracious benefits i looked on thy furniture so fine and made it fine to me thy glorious household-stuff did me entwine and 'tice me unto thee such stars i counted mine both heav'n and earth paid me my wages in a world of mirth what pleasures could i want whose king i serv 'd where joys my fellows were thus argu 'd into hopes my thoughts reserv'd no place for grief or fear therefore my sudden soul caught at the place and made her youth and fierceness seek thy face at first thou gav'st me milk and sweetnesses i had my wish and way my days were straw 'd with flow'rs and happiness there was no month but may but with my years sorrow did twist and grow and made a party unawares for woe my flesh began unto my soul in pain '' sicknesses cleave my bones consuming agues dwell in ev'ry vein and tune my breath to groans '' sorrow was all my soul i scarce believ 'd till grief did tell me roundly that i liv 'd when i got health thou took'st away my life and more for my friends die my mirth and edge was lost a blunted knife was of more use than i. thus thin and lean without a fence or friend i was blown through with ev'ry storm and wind whereas my birth and spirit rather took the way that takes the town thou didst betray me to a ling'ring book and wrap me in a gown i was entangled in the world of strife before i had the power to change my life yet for i threaten 'd oft the siege to raise not simp'ring all mine age thou often didst with academic praise melt and dissolve my rage i took thy sweet'ned pill till i came where i could not go away nor persevere yet lest perchance i should too happy be in my unhappiness turning my purge to food thou throwest me into more sicknesses thus doth thy power cross-bias me not making thine own gift good yet me from my ways taking now i am here what thou wilt do with me none of my books will show i read and sigh and wish i were a tree for sure then i should grow to fruit or shade at least some bird would trust her household to me and i should be just yet though thou troublest me i must be meek in weakness must be stout well i will change the service and go seek some other master out ah my dear god though i am clean forgot let me not love thee if i love thee not

the devil ’ s tour of hell did not include a factory line where molten lead spilled into mouths held wide no electric drill spiraling screws into hands and feet nor giant pliers to lower you into simmering vats instead a circle of light opened on your stuffed armchair whose chintz orchids did not boil and change and the devil adjusted your new spiked antennae almost delicately with claws curled and lacquered black before he spread his leather wings to leap into the acid-green sky so your head became a tv hull a gargoyle mirror your doppelganger sloppy at the mouth and swollen at the joints enacted your days in sinuous slow motion your lines delivered with a mocking sneer sometimes the frame froze reversed began again the red eyes of a friend you cursed your girl child cowered behind the drapes parents alive again and puzzled by this new form that ’ s why you clawed your way back to this life
a broken altar lord thy servant rears made of a heart and cemented with tears whose parts are as thy hand did frame no workman 's tool hath touch 'd the same a heart alone is such a stone as nothing but thy pow'r doth cut wherefore each part of my hard heart meets in this frame to praise thy name that if i chance to hold my peace these stones to praise thee may not cease oh let thy blessed sacrifice be mine and sanctify this altar to be thine

excerpt an anatomy of the world wherein by occasion of the untimely death of mistress elizabeth drury the frailty and the decay of this whole world is represented the first anniversary when that rich soul which to her heaven is gone whom all do celebrate who know they have one for who is sure he hath a soul unless it see and judge and follow worthiness and by deeds praise it he who doth not this may lodge an inmate soul but 't is not his when that queen ended here her progress time and as t'her standing house to heaven did climb where loath to make the saints attend her long she 's now a part both of the choir and song this world in that great earthquake languished for in a common bath of tears it bled which drew the strongest vital spirits out but succour 'd then with a perplexed doubt whether the world did lose or gain in this because since now no other way there is but goodness to see her whom all would see all must endeavour to be good as she this great consumption to a fever turn 'd and so the world had fits it joy 'd it mourn 'd and as men think that agues physic are and th ague being spent give over care so thou sick world mistak'st thy self to be well when alas thou'rt in a lethargy her death did wound and tame thee then and then thou might'st have better spar 'd the sun or man that wound was deep but 't is more misery that thou hast lost thy sense and memory 't was heavy then to hear thy voice of moan but this is worse that thou art speechless grown thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst thou wast nothing but she and her thou hast o'erpast for as a child kept from the font until a prince expected long come to fulfill the ceremonies thou unnam 'd had'st laid had not her coming thee her palace made her name defin 'd thee gave thee form and frame and thou forget'st to celebrate thy name some months she hath been dead but being dead measures of times are all determined but long she'ath been away long long yet none offers to tell us who it is that 's gone but as in states doubtful of future heirs when sickness without remedy impairs the present prince they 're loath it should be said '' the prince doth languish '' or `` the prince is dead '' so mankind feeling now a general thaw a strong example gone equal to law the cement which did faithfully compact and glue all virtues now resolv 'd and slack 'd thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead or that our weakness was discovered in that confession therefore spoke no more than tongues the soul being gone the loss deplore but though it be too late to succour thee sick world yea dead yea putrified since she thy intrinsic balm and thy preservative can never be renew 'd thou never live i since no man can make thee live will try what we may gain by thy anatomy her death hath taught us dearly that thou art corrupt and mortal in thy purest part let no man say the world itself being dead 'tis labour lost to have discovered the world 's infirmities since there is none alive to study this dissection for there 's a kind of world remaining still though she which did inanimate and fill the world be gone yet in this last long night her ghost doth walk that is a glimmering light a faint weak love of virtue and of good reflects from her on them which understood her worth and though she have shut in all day the twilight of her memory doth stay which from the carcass of the old world free creates a new world and new creatures be produc 'd the matter and the stuff of this her virtue and the form our practice is and though to be thus elemented arm these creatures from home-born intrinsic harm for all assum 'd unto this dignity so many weedless paradises be which of themselves produce no venomous sin except some foreign serpent bring it in yet because outward storms the strongest break and strength itself by confidence grows weak this new world may be safer being told the dangers and diseases of the old for with due temper men do then forgo or covet things when they their true worth know there is no health physicians say that we at best enjoy but a neutrality and can there be worse sickness than to know that we are never well nor can be so we are born ruinous poor mothers cry that children come not right nor orderly except they headlong come and fall upon an ominous precipitation how witty 's ruin how importunate upon mankind it labour 'd to frustrate even god 's purpose and made woman sent for man 's relief cause of his languishment they were to good ends and they are so still but accessory and principal in ill for that first marriage was our funeral one woman at one blow then kill 'd us all and singly one by one they kill us now we do delightfully our selves allow to that consumption and profusely blind we kill our selves to propagate our kind and yet we do not that we are not men there is not now that mankind which was then when as the sun and man did seem to strive joint tenants of the world who should survive when stag

much stress and strain whereby the wily vapour fain would slip back and rejoin its source before the term — and aptest in contrivance under god to baffle it by deftly stopping such — the vagrant scholar to his sage at home sends greeting health and knowledge fame with peace three samples of true snakestone—rarer still one of the other sort the melon-shaped but fitter pounded fine for charms than drugs and writeth now the twenty-second time my journeyings were brought to jericho thus i resume who studious in our art shall count a little labour unrepaid i have shed sweat enough left flesh

tufted ear lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls i cried and threw my staff and he was gone twice have the robbers stripped and beaten me and once a town declared me for a spy but at the end i reach jerusalem since this poor covert where i pass the night this bethany lies scarce the distance thence a man with plague-sores at the third degree runs till he drops down dead thou laughest here 'sooth it elates me thus reposed and safe to void the stuffing of my travel-scrip and share with thee whatever jewry yields a viscid choler is observable in tertians i was nearly bold to say and falling-sickness hath a happier cure than our school wots of there 's a spider here weaves no web watches on the ledge of tombs sprinkled with mottles on an ash-grey back take five and drop them but

town 's barrenness—or else the man had something in the look of him— his case has struck me far more than 't is worth so pardon if— lest presently i lose in the great press of novelty at hand the care and pains this somehow stole from me i bid thee take the thing while fresh in mind almost in sight—for wilt thou have the truth the very man is gone from me but now whose ailment is the subject of discourse thus then and let thy better wit help all 't is but a case of mania—subinduced by epilepsy at the turning-point of trance prolonged unduly some three days when by the exhibition of some drug or spell exorcization stroke of art unknown to me and which 'twere well to know the evil thing out-breaking all at once left the man whole and sound of body indeed — but flinging so to speak life 's gates too wide making a clear house of it too suddenly the first conceit that entered might inscribe whatever it was minded on the wall so plainly at that vantage as it were first come first served that nothing subsequent attaineth to erase those fancy-scrawls the just-returned and new-established soul hath gotten now so thoroughly by heart that henceforth she will read or these or none and first—the man 's own firm conviction rests that he was dead in fact they buried him —that he was dead and then restored to life by a nazarene physician of his tribe —'sayeth the same bade `` rise '' and he did rise `` such cases are diurnal '' thou wilt cry not so this figment —not that such a fume instead of giving way to time and health should eat itself into the life of life as saffron tingeth flesh blood bones and all for see how he takes up the after-life the man—it is one lazarus a jew sanguine proportioned fifty years of age the body 's habit wholly laudable as much indeed beyond the common health as he were made and put aside to show think could we penetrate by any drug and bathe the wearied soul and worried flesh and bring it clear and fair by three days sleep whence has the man the balm that brightens all this grown man eyes the world now like a child some elders of his tribe i should premise led in their friend obedient as a sheep to bear my inquisition while they spoke now sharply now with sorrow —told the case — he listened not except i spoke to him but folded his two hands and let them talk watching the flies that buzzed and yet no fool and that 's a sample how his years must go look if a beggar in fixed middle-life should find a treasure —can he use the same with straitened habits and with tastes starved small and take at once to his impoverished brain the sudden element that changes things that sets the undreamed-of rapture at his hand and puts the cheap old joy in the scorned dust is he not such an one as moves to mirth— warily parsimonious when no need wasteful as drunkenness at undue times all prudent counsel as to what befits the golden mean is lost on such an one the man 's fantastic will is the man 's law so here—we call the treasure knowledge say increased beyond the fleshly faculty— heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth earth forced on a soul 's use while seeing heaven the man is witless of the size the sum the value in proportion of all things or whether it be little or be much discourse to him of prodigious armaments assembled to besiege his city now and of the passing of a mule with gourds— 'tis one then take it on the other side speak of some trifling fact—he will gaze rapt with stupor at its very littleness far as i see as if in that indeed he caught prodigious import whole results and so will turn to us the bystanders in ever the same stupor note this point that we too see not with his opened eyes wonder and doubt come wrongly into play preposterously at cross purposes should his child sicken unto death —why look for scarce abatement of his cheerfulness or pretermission of the daily craft while a word gesture glance from that same child at play or in the school or laid asleep will startle him to an agony of fear exasperation just as like demand the reason why— '' tis but a word '' object— '' a gesture '' —he regards thee as our lord who lived there in the pyramid alone looked at us dost thou mind when being young we both would unadvisedly recite some charm 's beginning from that book of his able to bid the sun throb wide and burst all into stars as suns grown old are wont thou and the child have each a veil alike thrown o'er your heads from under which ye both stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match over a mine of greek fire did ye know he holds on firmly to some thread of life— it is the life to lead perforcedly which runs across some vast distracting orb of glory on either side that meagre thread which conscious of he must not enter yet— the spiritual life around the earthly life the law of that is known to him as this his heart and brain move there his feet stay here so is the man perplext with impulses sudden to start off crosswise not straight on proclaiming what is right and wrong across and not along this black thread through the blaze— '' it should be '' baulked by `` here it can not be '' and oft the man 's soul springs into his face as if he saw again and heard again his sage that bade him `` rise '' and he did rise something a word a tick of the blood within admonishes then back he sinks at once to ashes who was very fire before in sedulous recurrence to his trade whereby he earneth him the daily bread and studiously the humbler for that pride professedly the faultier that he knows god 's secret while he holds the thread of life indeed the especial marking of the man is prone submission to the heavenly will— seeing it what it is and why it is 'sayeth he will wait patient to the last for that same death which must restore his being to equilibrium body loosening soul divorced even now by premature full growth he will live nay it pleaseth him to live so long as god please and just how god please he even seeketh not to please god more which meaneth otherwise than as god please hence i perceive not he affects to preach the doctrine of his sect whate'er it be make proselytes as madmen thirst to do how can he give his neighbour the real ground his own conviction ardent as he is— call his great truth a lie why still the old '' be it as god please '' reassureth him i probed the sore as thy disciple should '' how beast '' said i `` this stolid carelessness sufficeth thee when rome is on her march to stamp out like a little spark thy town thy tribe thy crazy tale and thee at once '' he merely looked with his large eyes on me the man is apathetic you deduce contrariwise he loves both old and young able and weak affects the very brutes and birds—how say i flowers of the field— as a wise workman recognizes tools in a master 's workshop loving what they make thus is the man as harmless as a lamb only impatient let him do his best at ignorance and carelessness and sin— an indignation which is promptly curbed as when in certain travels i have feigned to be an ignoramus in our art according to some preconceived design and happed to hear the land 's practitioners steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance prattle fantastically on disease its cause and cure—and i must hold my peace thou wilt object—why have i not ere this sought out the sage himself the nazarene who wrought this cure inquiring at the source conferring with the frankness that befits alas it grieveth me the learned leech perished in a tumult many years ago accused —our learning 's fate —of wizardry rebellion to the setting up a rule and creed prodigious as described to me his death which happened when the earthquake fell prefiguring as soon appeared the loss to occult learning in our lord the sage who lived there in the pyramid alone was wrought by the mad people—that 's their wont on vain recourse as i conjecture it to his tried virtue for miraculous help— how could he stop the earthquake that 's their way the other imputations must be lies but take one though i loathe to give it thee in mere respect for any good man 's fame and after all our patient lazarus is stark mad should we count on what he says perhaps not though in writing to a leech 'tis well to keep back nothing of a case this man so cured regards the curer then as—god forgive me who but god himself creator and sustainer of the world that came and dwelt in flesh on 't awhile —'sayeth that such an one was born and lived taught healed the sick broke bread at his own house then died with lazarus by for aught i know and yet was what i said nor choose repeat and must have so avouched himself in fact in hearing of this very lazarus who saith—but why all this of what he saith why write of trivial matters things of price calling at every moment for remark i noticed on the margin of a pool blue-flowering borage the aleppo sort aboundeth very nitrous it is strange thy pardon for this long and tedious case which now that i review it needs must seem unduly dwelt on prolixly set forth nor i myself discern in what is writ good cause for the peculiar interest and awe indeed this man has touched me with perhaps the journey 's end the weariness had wrought upon me first i met him thus i crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills like an old lion 's cheek teeth out there came a moon made like a face with certain spots multiform manifold and menacing then a wind rose behind me so we met in this old sleepy town at unaware the man and i. i send thee what is writ regard it as a chance a matter risked to this ambiguous syrian—he may lose or steal or give it thee with equal good jerusalem 's repose shall make amends for time this letter wastes thy time and mine till when once more thy pardon and farewell the very god think abib dost thou think so the all-great were the all-loving too— so through the thunder comes a human voice saying `` o heart i made a heart beats here face my hands fashioned see it in myself thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine but love i gave thee with myself to love and thou must love me who have died for thee '' the madman saith he said so it is strange

rapt with the rage of mine own ravish 'd thought through contemplation of those goodly sights and glorious images in heaven wrought whose wondrous beauty breathing sweet delights do kindle love in high-conceited sprights i fain to tell the things that i behold but feel my wits to fail and tongue to fold vouchsafe then o thou most almighty spright from whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow to shed into my breast some sparkling light of thine eternal truth that i may show some little beams to mortal eyes below of that immortal beauty there with thee which in my weak distraughted mind i see that with the glory of so goodly sight the hearts of men which fondly here admire fair seeming shews and feed on vain delight transported with celestial desire of those fair forms may lift themselves up higher and learn to love with zealous humble duty th eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty beginning then below with th easy view of this base world subject to fleshly eye from thence to mount aloft by order due to contemplation of th immortal sky of the soare falcon so i learn to fly that flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath till she herself for stronger flight can breathe then look who list thy gazeful eyes to feed with sight of that is fair look on the frame of this wide universe and therein reed the endless kinds of creatures which by name thou canst not count much less their natures aim all which are made with wondrous wise respect and all with admirable beauty deckt first th earth on adamantine pillars founded amid the sea engirt with brazen bands then th air still flitting but yet firmly bounded on every side with piles of flaming brands never consum 'd nor quench 'd with mortal hands and last that mighty shining crystal wall wherewith he hath encompassed this all by view whereof it plainly may appear that still as every thing doth upward tend and further is from earth so still more clear and fair it grows till to his perfect end of purest beauty it at last ascend air more than water fire much more than air and heaven than fire appears more pure and fair look thou no further but affix thine eye on that bright shiny round still moving mass the house of blessed gods which men call sky all sow 'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass whereof each other doth in brightness pass but those two most which ruling night and day as king and queen the heavens empire sway and tell me then what hast thou ever seen that to their beauty may compared be or can the sight that is most sharp and keen endure their captain 's flaming head to see how much less those much higher in degree and so much fairer and much more than these as these are fairer than the land and seas for far above these heavens which here we see be others far exceeding these in light not bounded not corrupt as these same be but infinite in largeness and in height unmoving uncorrupt and spotless bright that need no sun t illuminate their spheres but their own native light far passing theirs and as these heavens still by degrees arise until they come to their first mover 's bound that in his mighty compass doth comprise and carry all the rest with him around so those likewise do by degrees redound and rise more fair till they at last arrive to the most fair whereto they all do strive fair is the heaven where happy souls have place in full enjoyment of felicity whence they do still behold the glorious face of the divine eternal majesty more fair is that where those ideas on high enranged be which plato so admired and pure intelligences from god inspired yet fairer is that heaven in which do reign the sovereign powers and mighty potentates which in their high protections do contain all mortal princes and imperial states and fairer yet whereas the royal seats and heavenly dominations are set from whom all earthly governance is fet yet far more fair be those bright cherubins which all with golden wings are overdight and those eternal burning seraphins which from their faces dart out fiery light yet fairer than they both and much more bright be th angels and archangels which attend on god 's own person without rest or end these thus in fair each other far excelling as to the highest they approach more near yet is that highest far beyond all telling fairer than all the rest which there appear though all their beauties join 'd together were how then can mortal tongue hope to express the image of such endless perfectness cease then my tongue and lend unto my mind leave to bethink how great that beauty is whose utmost parts so beautiful i find how much more those essential parts of his his truth his love his wisdom and his bliss his grace his doom his mercy and his might by which he lends us of himself a sight those unto all he daily doth display and shew himself in th image of his grace as in a looking-glass through which he may be seen of all his creatures vile and base that are unable else to see his face his glorious face which glistereth else so bright that th angels selves can not endure his sight but we frail wights whose sight can not sustain the sun 's bright beams when he on us doth shine but that their points rebutted back again are dull 'd how can we see with feeble eyne the glory of that majesty divine in sight of whom both sun and moon are dark compared to his least resplendent spark the means therefore which unto us is lent him to behold is on his works to look which he hath made in beauty excellent and in the same as in a brazen book to read enregister 'd in every nook his goodness which his beauty doth declare for all that 's good is beautiful and fair thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation to imp the wings of thy high-flying mind mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation from this dark world whose damps the soul so blind and like the native brood of eagles kind on that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes clear 'd from gross mists of frail infirmities humbled with fear and awful reverence before the footstool of his majesty throw thyself down with trembling innocence ne dare look up with corruptible eye on the dread face of that great deity for fear lest if he chance to look on thee thou turn to nought and quite confounded be but lowly fall before his mercy seat close covered with the lamb 's integrity from the just wrath of his avengeful threat that sits upon the righteous throne on high his throne is built upon eternity more firm and durable than steel or brass or the hard diamond which them both doth pass his sceptre is the rod of righteousness with which he bruiseth all his foes to dust and the great dragon strongly doth repress under the rigour of his judgement just his seat is truth to which the faithful trust from whence proceed her beams so pure and bright that all about him sheddeth glorious light light far exceeding that bright blazing spark which darted is from titan 's flaming head that with his beams enlumineth the dark and dampish air whereby all things are read whose nature yet so much is marvelled of mortal wits that it doth much amaze the greatest wizards which thereon do gaze but that immortal light which there doth shine is many thousand times more bright more clear more excellent more glorious more divine through which to god all mortal actions here and even the thoughts of men do plain appear for from th eternal truth it doth proceed through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed with the great glory of that wondrous light his throne is all encompassed around and hid in his own brightness from the sight of all that look thereon with eyes unsound and underneath his feet are to be found thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire the instruments of his avenging ire there in his bosom sapience doth sit the sovereign darling of the deity clad like a queen in royal robes most fit for so great power and peerless majesty and all with gems and jewels gorgeously adorn 'd that brighter than the stars appear and make her native brightness seem more clear and on her head a crown of purest gold is set in sign of highest sovereignty and in her hand a sceptre she doth hold with which she rules the house of god on high and manageth the ever-moving sky and in the same these lower creatures all subjected to her power imperial both heaven and earth obey unto her will and all the creatures which they both contain for of her fullness which the world doth fill they all partake and do in state remain as their great maker did at first ordain through observation of her high behest by which they first were made and still increast the fairness of her face no tongue can tell for she the daughters of all women 's race and angels eke in beauty doth excel sparkled on her from god 's own glorious face and more increas 'd by her own goodly grace that it doth far exceed all human thought ne can on earth compared be to aught ne could that painter had he lived yet which pictured venus with so curious quill that all posterity admired it have portray 'd this for all his mast'ring skill ne she herself had she remained still and were as fair as fabling wits do feign could once come near this beauty sovereign but had those wits the wonders of their days or that sweet teian poet which did spend his plenteous vein in setting forth her praise seen but a glimpse of this which i pretend how wondrously would he her face commend above that idol of his feigning thought that all the world should with his rhymes be fraught how then dare i the novice of his art presume to picture so divine a wight or hope t express her least perfection 's part whose beauty fills the heavens with her light and darks the earth with shadow of her sight ah gentle muse thou art too weak and faint the portrait of so heavenly hue to paint let angels which her goodly face behold and see at will her sovereign praises sing and those most sacred mysteries unfold of that fair love of mighty heaven 's king enough is me t admire so heavenly thing and being thus with her huge love possest in th only wonder of herself to rest but whoso may thrice happy man him hold of all on earth whom god so much doth grace and lets his own beloved to behold for in the view of her celestial face all joy all bliss all happiness have place ne aught on earth can want unto the wight who of herself can win the wishful sight for she out of her secret treasury plenty of riches forth on him will pour even heavenly riches which there hidden lie within the closet of her chastest bower th eternal portion of her precious dower which mighty god hath given to her free and to all those which thereof worthy be none thereof worthy be but those whom she vouchsafeth to her presence to receive and letteth them her lovely face to see whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive and sweet contentment that it doth bereave their soul of sense through infinite delight and them transport from flesh into the spright in which they see such admirable things as carries them into an ecstasy and hear such heavenly notes and carollings of god 's high praise that fills the brazen sky and feel such joy and pleasure inwardly that maketh them all worldly cares forget and only think on that before them set ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense or idle thought of earthly things remain but all that erst seem 'd sweet seems now offence and all that pleased erst now seems to pain their joy their comfort their desire their gain is fixed all on that which now they see all other sights but feigned shadows be and that fair lamp which useth to inflame the hearts of men with self-consuming fire thenceforth seems foul and full of sinful blame and all that pomp to which proud minds aspire by name of honour and so much desire seems to them baseness and all riches dross and all mirth sadness and all lucre loss so full their eyes are of that glorious sight and senses fraught with such satiety that in nought else on earth they can delight but in th aspect of that felicity which they have written in their inward eye on which they feed and in their fastened mind all happy joy and full contentment find ah then my hungry soul which long hast fed on idle fancies of thy foolish thought and with false beauty 's flatt'ring bait misled hast after vain deceitful shadows sought which all are fled and now have left thee nought but late repentance through thy follies prief ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief and look at last up to that sovereign light from whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs that kindleth love in every godly sprite even the love of god which loathing brings of this vile world and these gay-seeming things with whose sweet pleasures being so possest thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest
adam a brown old vulture in the rain shivered below his wind-whipped olive-trees huddling sharp chin on scarred and scraggy knees he moaned and mumbled to his darkening brain ‘ he was the grandest of them all—was cain ‘ a lion laired in the hills that none could tire ‘ swift as a stag a stallion of the plain ‘ hungry and fierce with deeds of huge desire. ’ grimly he thought of abel soft and fair— a lover with disaster in his face and scarlet blossom twisted in bright hair ‘ afraid to fight was murder more disgrace ... ‘ god always hated cain ’ ... he bowed his head— the gaunt wild man whose lovely sons were dead

on the way to the village store i drive through a down-draft from the neighbor ’ s chimney woodsmoke tumbles from the eaves backlit by sun reminding me of the fire and sulfur of grandmother ’ s vengeful god the one who disapproves of jeans and shorts for girls dancing strong waters and adultery a moment later the smoke enters the car although the windows are tight insinuating that i might like judas and the foolish virgins and the rich young man have been made for unquenchable fire god will need something to burn if the fire is to be unquenchable “ all things work together for the good for those who love god ” she said to comfort me at uncle hazen ’ s funeral where father held me up to see the maroon gladiolus that trembled as we approached the bier the elaborate shirred satin brass fittings anything oh anything but uncle ’ s squelched and made-up face “ no no how is it good to be dead ” i cried afterward wild-eyed and flushed “ god ’ s ways are not our ways ” she said then out of pity and the wish to forestall the argument
it wasn ’ t the bright hems of the lord ’ s skirts that brushed my face and i opened my eyes to see from a cleft in rock his backside it ’ s a wasp perched on my left cheek i keep my eyes closed and stand perfectly still in the garden till it leaves me alone not to contemplate how this century ends and the next begins with no one i know having seen god but to wonder why i get through most days unscathed though i live in a time when it might be otherwise and i grow more fatherless each day for years now i have come to conclusions without my father ’ s help discovering on my own what i know what i don ’ t know and seeing how one cancels the other i 've become a scholar of cancellations here i stand among my father ’ s roses and see that what punctures outnumbers what consoles the cruel and the tender never make peace though one climbs though one descends petal by petal to the hidden ground no one owns i see that which is taken away by violence or persuasion the rose announces on earth the kingdom of gravity a bird cancels it my eyelids cancel the bird anything might cancel my eyes distance time war my father said never take your both eyes off of the world before he rocked me all night we waited for the knock that would have signalled all clear come now it would have meant escape it never came i didn ’ t make the world i leave you with he said and then being poor he left me only this world in which there is always a family waiting in terror before they ’ re rended this world wherein a man might arise go down and walk along a path and pause and bow to roses roses his father raised and admire them for one moment unable thank god to see in each and every flower the world cancelling itself

vienna i shut out the light or let it filter through these frowning aisles as penitentially as though it walked in sackcloth let it be laid at the feet of all that ever grew twisted and false like this rococo shrine where cupids smirk from candy clouds and where the lord with polished nails and perfumed hair performs a parody of the divine the candles hiss the organ-pedals storm writhing and dark the columns leave the earth to find a lonelier and darker height the church grows dingy while the human swarm struggles against the impenitent body ’ s mirth ashes to ashes go shut out the light hinterbrühl ii and so the light runs laughing from the town pulling the sun with him along the roads that shed their muddy rivers as he goads each blade of grass the ice had flattened down at every empty bush he stops to fling handfuls of birds with green and yellow throats while even the hens uncertain of their notes stir rusty vowels in attempts to sing he daubs the chestnut-tips with sudden reds and throws an olive blush on naked hills that hoped somehow to keep themselves in white who calls for sackcloth now he leaps and spreads a carnival of color gladly spills his blood the resurrection—and the light

the blessing safely lifted onto joshua ’ s shoulders moses climbed up mount nebo high above moab tendons winced as he bent to retie a sandal and haze flooded his vision which had nothing to see or black rock and scrub thorn only until he stopped and said i will wait here for the voice of the most high you showed him all the land— gilead the hills of ephraim and manasseh from judah to the western sea as far as zoar and said your eyes have seen what i promised yet because at meribah-kadesh you failed to manifest the holiness i am you do not go in at that distance and from the heights moses stood and watched as the children of israel began the westward trek his sight strengthened and he saw each one the mother thin and staring bent down to take her firstborn ’ s hand who cried and then laughed the young brothers with new beards and faces blackened by years in sinai strode along carrying all they had rolled up in a sheepskin the white-haired elder and his mourning wife whose only daughter was lost in the desert stalked slowly forward without speaking an orphaned girl her cousin and her cousin ’ s husband discussed it quietly and held hands a concert of voices murmurs cries laughter rising falling babbling like water the fountain of meribah-kadesh that sprang from a wall of rock in the desert when moses struck it with his staff days of his life returned to him one last time he saw miriam ’ s serious gaze during the hours of instruction he recalled the harp players in pharaoh ’ s summer palace white noonday and the shadow of his hand raised to strike the egyptian overseer zipporah ’ s fear and trust when jethro urged her forward the brush-tree that spoke out in tongues of fire egypt ’ s plagues blood on the doorposts for a sign the exiles ’ safe conduct across marshlands among bulrushes as seabirds called overhead mutiny and lightning in the desert a pillar of smoke by day and fire by night the moment drew near as those he was bound to and had contended with went up to a land of hills dusted with the first spring green sheep stopped their grazing to stare like an intake of breath a lull suspended the low hum hovering around hillsides in flower his eyes filled with tears and silver bands of sun broke from a veil of cloud overhead down to the plain of moab lighting the face of joshua on one side so that half remained in shadow at that moment moses was taken to his people his body is said to be buried at beth-peor yet the grave has never been found the grave has never been found— and joshua led the israelites westward into canaan
a bird flew out at the break of day from the nest where it had curled and ere the eve the bird had set fear on the kings of the world the first tree it lit upon was green with leaves unshed the second tree it lit upon was red with apples red the third tree it lit upon was barren and was brown save for a dead man nailed thereon on a hill above a town that night the kings of the earth were gay and filled the cup and can last night the kings of the earth were chill for dread of a naked man ‘ if he speak two more words ’ they said ‘ the slave is more than the free if he speak three more words ’ they said ‘ the stars are under the sea. ’ said the king of the east to the king of the west i wot his frown was set ‘ lo let us slay him and make him as dung it is well that the world forget. ’ said the king of the west to the king of the east i wot his smile was dread ‘ nay let us slay him and make him a god it is well that our god be dead. ’ they set the young man on a hill they nailed him to a rod and there in darkness and in blood they made themselves a god and the mightiest word was left unsaid and the world had never a mark and the strongest man of the sons of men went dumb into the dark then hymns and harps of praise they brought incense and gold and myrrh and they thronged above the seraphim the poor dead carpenter ‘ thou art the prince of all ’ they sang ‘ ocean and earth and air. ’ then the bird flew on to the cruel cross and hid in the dead man ’ s hair ‘ thou art the son of the world. ’ they cried ‘ speak if our prayers be heard. ’ and the brown bird stirred in the dead man ’ s hair and it seemed that the dead man stirred then a shriek went up like the world ’ s last cry from all nations under heaven and a master fell before a slave and begged to be forgiven they cowered for dread in his wakened eyes the ancient wrath to see and a bird flew out of the dead christ ’ s hair and lit on a lemon tree
then fled o brethren the wicked juba and wandered wandered far from curfew joys in the dismal ’ s night fool of st. elmo ’ s fire in scary night i wandered praying lord god my harshener speak to me now or let me die speak lord to this mourner and came at length to livid trees where ibo warriors hung shadowless turning in wind that moaned like africa their belltongue bodies dead their eyes alive with the anger deep in my own heart is this the sign the sign forepromised me the spirits vanished afraid and lonely i wandered on in blackness speak to me now or let me die die whispered the blackness and wild things gasped and scuffled in the night seething shapes of evil frolicked upon the air i reeled with fear i prayed sudden brightness clove the preying darkness brightness that was itself a golden darkness brightness so bright that it was darkness and there were angels their faces hidden from me angels at war with one another angels in dazzling combat and oh the splendor the fearful splendor of that warring hide me i cried to rock and bramble hide me the rock the bramble cried how tell you of that holy battle the shock of wing on wing and sword on sword was the tumult of a taken city burning i can not say how long they strove for the wheel in a turning wheel which is time in eternity had ceased its whirling and owl and moccasin panther and nameless beast and i were held like creatures fixed in flaming in fiery amber but i saw i saw oh many of those mighty beings waver waver and fall go streaking down into swamp water and the water hissed and steamed and bubbled and locked shuddering shuddering over the fallen and soon was motionless then that massive light began a-folding slowly in upon itself and i beheld the conqueror faces and lo they were like mine i saw they were like mine and in joy and terror wept praising praising jehovah oh praised my honer harshener till a sleep came over me a sleep heavy as death and when i awoke at last free and purified i rose and prayed and returned after a time to the blazing fields to the humbleness and bided my time

1 one royal afternoon when i was young and easily surprised by uncles coming from the park at the command of nurses and of guards i wondered over trees and ponds at the sorry rude walls and the white windows of the apartments “ these ” said my uncle “ are the tallest houses. ” 2 yes in the spring of my joy when i was visibly affected by a gaitered bishop large and unsteady in the flagged yard guards dogs and blackbirds fled on every hand “ he is an old one ” said uncle “ the gaiters are real. ” 3 rippled fistfed windows of your dun high houses then come cages made of pretty willows where they put the palace girls green ducks wade slowly from the marble water one swan reproves a saucy daughter i consider my own true pond look for the beginning and the end i lead the bishop down lanes and islands 4 yes in the windows of my first existence before my yawns became seasons when nurses and uncles were sure chinese fowl fought the frosty water startled by this old pontifex “ no bridge ” he smiled between the budding branches “ no crossing to the cage of the paradise bird ” astounded by the sermons in the leaves i cried “ no no the stars have higher houses ” kicking the robins and ganders from the floor of his insular world the magic bishop leaned his blessing on the children 5 that was the bold day when moved by the unexpected summons i opened all the palace aviaries as by a king ’ s representative i was appointed fowler
rome 15— vanity saith the preacher vanity draw round my bed is anselm keeping back nephews—sons mine ah god i know not well— she men would have to be your mother once old gandolf envied me so fair she was what 's done is done and she is dead beside dead long ago and i am bishop since and as she died so must we die ourselves and thence ye may perceive the world 's a dream life how and what is it as here i lie in this state-chamber dying by degrees hours and long hours in the dead night i ask '' do i live am i dead '' peace peace seems all saint praxed 's ever was the church for peace and so about this tomb of mine i fought with tooth and nail to save my niche ye know —old gandolf cozened me despite my care shrewd was that snatch from out the corner south he graced his carrion with god curse the same yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence one sees the pulpit o the epistle-side and somewhat of the choir those silent seats and up into the aery dome where live the angels and a sunbeam 's sure to lurk and i shall fill my slab of basalt there and 'neath my tabernacle take my rest with those nine columns round me two and two the odd one at my feet where anselm stands peach-blossom marble all the rare the ripe as fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse —old gandolf with his paltry onion-stone put me where i may look at him true peach rosy and flawless how i earned the prize draw close that conflagration of my church —what then so much was saved if aught were missed my sons ye would not be my death go dig the white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood drop water gently till the surface sink and if ye find ah god i know not i ... bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft and corded up in a tight olive-frail some lump ah god of lapis lazuli big as a jew

like god the father 's globe on both his hands ye worship in the jesu church so gay for gandolf shall not choose but see and burst swift as a weaver 's shuttle fleet our years man goeth to the grave and where is he did i say basalt for my slab sons black— 'twas ever antique-black i meant how else shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath the bas-relief in bronze ye promised me those pans and nymphs ye wot of and perchance some tripod thyrsus with a vase or so the saviour at his sermon on the mount saint praxed in a glory and one pan ready to twitch the nymph 's last garment off and moses with the tables but i know ye mark me not what do they whisper thee child of my bowels anselm ah ye hope to revel down my villas while i gasp bricked o'er with beggar 's mouldy travertine which gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at nay boys ye love me—all of jasper then 't is jasper ye stand pledged to lest i grieve my bath must needs be left behind alas one block pure green as a pistachio-nut there 's plenty jasper somewhere in the world— and have i not saint praxed 's ear to pray horses for ye and brown greek manuscripts and mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs —that 's if ye carve my epitaph aright choice latin picked phrase tully 's every word no gaudy ware like gandolf 's second line— tully my masters ulpian serves his need and then how i shall lie through centuries and hear the blessed mutter of the mass and see god made and eaten all day long and feel the steady candle-flame and taste good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke for as i lie here hours of the dead night dying in state and by such slow degrees i fold my arms as if they clasped a crook and stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point and let the bedclothes for a mortcloth drop into great laps and folds of sculptor's-work and as yon tapers dwindle and strange thoughts grow with a certain humming in my ears about the life before i lived this life and this life too popes cardinals and priests saint praxed at his sermon on the mount your tall pale mother with her talking eyes and new-found agate urns as fresh as day and marble 's language latin pure discreet —aha elucescebat quoth our friend no tully said i ulpian at the best evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage all lapis all sons else i give the pope my villas will ye ever eat my heart ever your eyes were as a lizard 's quick they glitter like your mother 's for my soul or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze piece out its starved design and fill my vase with grapes and add a vizor and a term and to the tripod ye would tie a lynx that in his struggle throws the thyrsus down to comfort me on my entablature whereon i am to lie till i must ask '' do i live am i dead '' there leave me there for ye have stabbed me with ingratitude to death—ye wish it—god ye wish it stone— gritstone a-crumble clammy squares which sweat as if the corpse they keep were oozing through— and no more lapis to delight the world well go i bless ye fewer tapers there but in a row and going turn your backs —ay like departing altar-ministrants and leave me in my church the church for peace that i may watch at leisure if he leers— old gandolf at me from his onion-stone as still he envied me so fair she was
ruminant pillows gregarious soft boulders if one of you found a gap in a stone wall the rest of you—rams ewes bucks wethers lambs mothers and daughters old grandfather-father cousins and aunts small bleating sons— followed onward stupid as sheep wherever your leader ’ s sheep-brain wandered to my grandfather spent all day searching the valley and edges of ragged mountain calling “ ke-day ” as if he brought you salt “ ke-day ke-day ” when the shirt wore out and darns in the woolen shirt needed darning a woman in a white collar cut the shirt into strips and braided it as she braided her hair every morning in a hundred years the knees of her great-granddaughter crawled on a rug made from the wool of sheep whose bones were mud like the bones of the woman who stares from an oval in the parlor i forked the brambly hay down to you in nineteen-fifty i delved my hands deep in the winter grass of your hair when the shearer cut to your nakedness in april and you dropped black eyes in shame hiding in barnyard corners unable to hide i brought grain to raise your spirits and ten thousand years wound us through pasture and hayfield together threads of us woven together three hundred generations from africa ’ s hills to new hampshire ’ s you were not shrewd like the pig you were not strong like the horse you were not brave like the rooster yet none of the others looked like a lump of granite that grew hair and none of the others carried white fleece as soft as dandelion seed around a black face and none of them sang such a flat and sociable song now the black-faced sheep have wandered and will not return even if i should search the valleys and call “ ke-day ” as if i brought them salt now the railroad draws a line of rust through the valley birch pine and maple lean from cellarholes and cover the dead pastures of ragged mountain except where machines make snow and cables pull money up hill to slide back down at south danbury church twelve of us sit— cousins and aunts sons— where the great-grandfathers of the forty-acre farms filled every pew i look out the window at summer places at boston lawyers ’ houses with swimming pools cunningly added to cowsheds and we read an old poem aloud about israel ’ s sheep old lumps of wool and we read that the rich farmer though he names his farm for himself takes nothing into his grave that even if people praise us because we are successful we will go under the ground to meet our ancestors collected there in the darkness that we are all of us sheep and death is our shepherd and we die as the animals die
you have dragged me on through the wild wood ways you have given me toil and scanty rest i have seen the light of ten thousand days grow dim and sink and fade in the west once you bore me forth from the dusty gloom weeping and helpless and naked and blind now you would hide me deep down in the tomb and wander away on the moonlit wind you would bury me like a thing of shame silently into the darkness thrust you would mix my heart that was once a flame with the mouldering clay and the wandering dust the eyes that wept for your sorrowful will shall be laid among evil and unclean things the heart that was faithful through good and ill you scorn for a flutter of tawdry wings you were the moonlight i lived in the sun could there ever be peace between us twain i sought the many you seek the one you are the slayer i am the slain oh soul when you mount to your flame-built throne will you dream no dream of the broken clay will you breathe o ’ er the stars in your pathway strown no sigh for the daisies of yesterday as you wander the shining corridors a lonely wave in the ocean of light have you never a thought of the lake ’ s lost shores or the fire-lit cottage dim and white shall not the dear smell of the rain-wet soil through the windless spheres and the silence float shall not my hands that are brown with toil take your dreams and high desires by the throat behold i reach forth from beyond the years i will cry to you from beneath the sod i will drag you back from the starry spheres yea down from the very bosom of god you can not hide from the sun and the wind or the whispered song of the april rain the proud earth that moulds all things to her mind shall gather you out of the deeps again you shall follow once more a wandering fire you shall gaze again on the starlit sea you shall gather roses out of the mire alas but you shall not remember me

o wave god who broke through me today sea bream massive pink and silver cool swimming down with me watching staying away from the spear volcano belly keeper who lifted this island for our own beaded bodies adornment and sprinkles us all with his laugh— ash in the eve mist or smoke on the bare high limits— underwater lava flows easing to coral holes filled with striped feeding swimmers o sky gods cartwheeling out of pacific turning rainsqualls over like lids on us then shine on our sodden— scanned out a rainbow today at the cow drinking trough sluicing off lakhs of crystal buddha fields right on the hair of the arm who wavers right now in the bamboo a half-gone waning moon drank down a bowlful of shochu in praise of antares gazing far up the lanes of sagittarius richest stream of our sky— a cup to the center of the galaxy and let the eyes stray right-angling the pitch of the milky way horse-heads rings clouds too distant to be slide free on the crest of the wave each night o earth mother i have wrappt my hand over the jut of your cobra-hood sleeping left my ear all night long by your mouth o all gods tides capes currents flows and spirals of pool and powers— as we hoe the field let sweet potato grow and as sit us all down when we may to consider the dharma bring with a flower and a glimmer let us all sleep in peace together bless masa and me as we marry at new moon on the crater this summer viii 40067

`` thou thoughtest that i was altogether such a one as thyself '' david psalms 50.21 'will sprawl now that the heat of day is best flat on his belly in the pit 's much mire with elbows wide fists clenched to prop his chin and while he kicks both feet in the cool slush and feels about his spine small eft-things course run in and out each arm and make him laugh and while above his head a pompion-plant coating the cave-top as a brow its eye creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard and now a flower drops with a bee inside and now a fruit to snap at catch and crunch — he looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams cross and recross till they weave a spider-web meshes of fire some great fish breaks at times and talks to his own self howe'er he please touching that other whom his dam called god because to talk about him vexes—ha could he but know and time to vex is now when talk is safer than in winter-time moreover prosper and miranda sleep in confidence he drudges at their task and it is good to cheat the pair and gibe letting the rank tongue blossom into speech setebos setebos and setebos 'thinketh he dwelleth i the cold o the moon 'thinketh he made it with the sun to match but not the stars the stars came otherwise only made clouds winds meteors such as that also this isle what lives and grows thereon and snaky sea which rounds and ends the same 'thinketh it came of being ill at ease he hated that he can not change his cold nor cure its ache 'hath spied an icy fish that longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she lived and thaw herself within the lukewarm brine o the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid a crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of wave only she ever sickened found repulse at the other kind of water not her life green-dense and dim-delicious bred o the sun flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe and in her old bounds buried her despair hating and loving warmth alike so he 'thinketh he made thereat the sun this isle trees and the fowls here beast and creeping thing yon otter sleek-wet black lithe as a leech yon auk one fire-eye in a ball of foam that floats and feeds a certain badger brown he hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye by moonlight and the pie with the long tongue that pricks deep into oak warts for a worm and says a plain word when she finds her prize but will not eat the ants the ants themselves that build a wall of seeds and settled stalks about their hole—he made all these and more made all we see and us in spite how else he could not himself make a second self to be his mate as well have made himself he would not make what he mislikes or slights an eyesore to him or not worth his pains but did in envy listlessness or sport make what himself would fain in a manner be— weaker in most points stronger in a few worthy and yet mere playthings all the while things he admires and mocks too —that is it because so brave so better though they be it nothing skills if he begin to plague look now i melt a gourd-fruit into mash add honeycomb and pods i have perceived which bite like finches when they bill and kiss — then when froth rises bladdery drink up all quick quick till maggots scamper through my brain last throw me on my back i the seeded thyme and wanton wishing i were born a bird put case unable to be what i wish i yet could make a live bird out of clay would not i take clay pinch my caliban able to fly —for there see he hath wings and great comb like the hoopoe 's to admire and there a sting to do his foes offence there and i will that he begin to live fly to yon rock-top nip me off the horns of grigs high up that make the merry din saucy through their veined wings and mind me not in which feat if his leg snapped brittle clay and he lay stupid-like —why i should laugh and if he spying me should fall to weep beseech me to be good repair his wrong bid his poor leg smart less or grow again — well as the chance were this might take or else not take my fancy i might hear his cry and give the mankin three sound legs for one or pluck the other off leave him like an egg and lessoned he was mine and merely clay were this no pleasure lying in the thyme drinking the mash with brain become alive making and marring clay at will so he 'thinketh such shows nor right nor wrong in him nor kind nor cruel he is strong and lord 'am strong myself compared to yonder crabs that march now from the mountain to the sea 'let twenty pass and stone the twenty-first loving not hating not just choosing so 'say the first straggler that boasts purple spots shall join the file one pincer twisted off 'say this bruised fellow shall receive a worm and two worms he whose nippers end in red as it likes me each time i do so he well then 'supposeth he is good i the main placable if his mind and ways were guessed but rougher than his handiwork be sure oh he hath made things worthier than himself and envieth that so helped such things do more than he who made them what consoles but this that they unless through him do nought at all and must submit what other use in things 'hath cut a pipe of pithless elder-joint that blown through gives exact the scream o the jay when from her wing you twitch the feathers blue sound this and little birds that hate the jay flock within stone 's throw glad their foe is hurt put case such pipe could prattle and boast forsooth '' i catch the birds i am the crafty thing i make the cry my maker can not make with his great round mouth he must blow through mine would not i smash it with my foot so he but wherefore rough why cold and ill at ease aha that is a question ask for that what knows —the something over setebos that made him or he may be found and fought worsted drove off and did to nothing perchance there may be something quiet o'er his head out of his reach that feels nor joy nor grief since both derive from weakness in some way i joy because the quails come would not joy could i bring quails here when i have a mind this quiet all it hath a mind to doth 'esteemeth stars the outposts of its couch but never spends much thought nor care that way it may look up work up —the worse for those it works on 'careth but for setebos the many-handed as a cuttle-fish who making himself feared through what he does looks up first and perceives he can not soar to what is quiet and hath happy life next looks down here and out of very spite makes this a bauble-world to ape yon real these good things to match those as hips do grapes 't is solace making baubles ay and sport himself peeped late eyed prosper at his books careless and lofty lord now of the isle vexed 'stitched a book of broad leaves arrow-shaped wrote thereon he knows what prodigious words has peeled a wand and called it by a name weareth at whiles for an enchanter 's robe the eyed skin of a supple oncelot and hath an ounce sleeker than youngling mole a four-legged serpent he makes cower and couch now snarl now hold its breath and mind his eye and saith she is miranda and my wife 'keeps for his ariel a tall pouch-bill crane he bids go wade for fish and straight disgorge also a sea-beast lumpish which he snared blinded the eyes of and brought somewhat tame and split its toe-webs and now pens the drudge in a hole o the rock and calls him caliban a bitter heart that bides its time and bites 'plays thus at being prosper in a way taketh his mirth with make-believes so he his dam held that the quiet made all things which setebos vexed only 'holds not so who made them weak meant weakness he might vex had he meant other while his hand was in why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick or plate my scalp with bone against the snow or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and joint like an orc 's armour ay —so spoil his sport he is the one now only he doth all 'saith he may like perchance what profits him ay himself loves what does him good but why 'gets good no otherwise this blinded beast loves whoso places flesh-meat on his nose but had he eyes would want no help but hate or love just as it liked him he hath eyes also it pleaseth setebos to work use all his hands and exercise much craft by no means for the love of what is worked 'tasteth himself no finer good i the world when all goes right in this safe summer-time and he wants little hungers aches not much than trying what to do with wit and strength 'falls to make something 'piled yon pile of turfs and squared and stuck there squares of soft white chalk and with a fish-tooth scratched a moon on each and set up endwise certain spikes of tree and crowned the whole with a sloth 's skull a-top found dead i the woods too hard for one to kill no use at all i the work for work 's sole sake 'shall some day knock it down again so he 'saith he is terrible watch his feats in proof one hurricane will spoil six good months hope he hath a spite against me that i know just as he favours prosper who knows why so it is all the same as well i find 'wove wattles half the winter fenced them firm with stone and stake to stop she-tortoises crawling to lay their eggs here well one wave feeling the foot of him upon its neck gaped as a snake does lolled out its large tongue and licked the whole labour flat so much for spite 'saw a ball flame down late yonder it lies where half an hour before i slept i the shade often they scatter sparkles there is force 'dug up a newt he may have envied once and turned to stone shut up inside a stone please him and hinder this —what prosper does aha if he would tell me how not he there is the sport discover how or die all need not die for of the things o the isle some flee afar some dive some run up trees those at his mercy —why they please him most when when well never try the same way twice repeat what act has pleased he may grow wroth you must not know his ways and play him off sure of the issue 'doth the like himself 'spareth a squirrel that it nothing fears but steals the nut from underneath my thumb and when i threat bites stoutly in defence 'spareth an urchin that contrariwise curls up into a ball pretending death for fright at my approach the two ways please but what would move my choler more than this

suddenly i saw the cold and rook-delighting heaven that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice and thereupon imagination and heart were driven so wild that every casual thought of that and this vanished and left but memories that should be out of season with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken confusion of the death-bed over is it sent out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken by the injustice of the skies for punishment
i struck the board and cried `` no more i will abroad what shall i ever sigh and pine my lines and life are free free as the road loose as the wind as large as store shall i be still in suit have i no harvest but a thorn to let me blood and not restore what i have lost with cordial fruit sure there was wine before my sighs did dry it there was corn before my tears did drown it is the year only lost to me have i no bays to crown it no flowers no garlands gay all blasted all wasted not so my heart but there is fruit and thou hast hands recover all thy sigh-blown age on double pleasures leave thy cold dispute of what is fit and not forsake thy cage thy rope of sands which petty thoughts have made and made to thee good cable to enforce and draw and be thy law while thou didst wink and wouldst not see away take heed i will abroad call in thy death's-head there tie up thy fears he that forbears to suit and serve his need deserves his load '' but as i raved and grew more fierce and wild at every word methought i heard one calling child and i replied my lord

`` pheu pheu ti prosderkesthe m ommasin tekna '' alas alas why do you gaze at me with your eyes my children. —medea do ye hear the children weeping o my brothers ere the sorrow comes with years they are leaning their young heads against their mothers — and that can not stop their tears the young lambs are bleating in the meadows the young birds are chirping in the nest the young fawns are playing with the shadows the young flowers are blowing toward the west— but the young young children o my brothers they are weeping bitterly they are weeping in the playtime of the others in the country of the free do you question the young children in the sorrow why their tears are falling so the old man may weep for his to-morrow which is lost in long ago — the old tree is leafless in the forest — the old year is ending in the frost — the old wound if stricken is the sorest — the old hope is hardest to be lost but the young young children o my brothers do you ask them why they stand weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers in our happy fatherland they look up with their pale and sunken faces and their looks are sad to see for the man 's grief abhorrent draws and presses down the cheeks of infancy — '' your old earth '' they say `` is very dreary '' `` our young feet '' they say `` are very weak '' few paces have we taken yet are weary— our grave-rest is very far to seek ask the old why they weep and not the children for the outside earth is cold — and we young ones stand without in our bewildering and the graves are for the old '' `` true '' say the children `` it may happen that we die before our time little alice died last year her grave is shapen like a snowball in the rime we looked into the pit prepared to take her — was no room for any work in the close clay from the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her crying 'get up little alice it is day if you listen by that grave in sun and shower with your ear down little alice never cries could we see her face be sure we should not know her for the smile has time for growing in her eyes — and merry go her moments lulled and stilled in the shroud by the kirk-chime it is good when it happens '' say the children `` that we die before our time '' alas the wretched children they are seeking death in life as best to have they are binding up their hearts away from breaking with a cerement from the grave go out children from the mine and from the city — sing out children as the little thrushes do — pluck you handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty laugh aloud to feel your fingers let them through but they answer `` are your cowslips of the meadows like our weeds anear the mine leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows from your pleasures fair and fine `` for oh '' say the children `` we are weary and we can not run or leap — if we cared for any meadows it were merely to drop down in them and sleep our knees tremble sorely in the stooping — we fall upon our faces trying to go and underneath our heavy eyelids drooping the reddest flower would look as pale as snow for all day we drag our burden tiring through the coal-dark underground — or all day we drive the wheels of iron in the factories round and round `` for all day the wheels are droning turning — their wind comes in our faces — till our hearts turn — our heads with pulses burning and the walls turn in their places turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling — turns the long light that droppeth down the wall — turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling — all are turning all the day and we with all — and all day the iron wheels are droning and sometimes we could pray 'o ye wheels breaking out in a mad moaning 'stop be silent for to-day `` ay be silent let them hear each other breathing for a moment mouth to mouth — let them touch each other 's hands in a fresh wreathing of their tender human youth let them feel that this cold metallic motion is not all the life god fashions or reveals — let them prove their inward souls against the notion that they live in you or under you o wheels — still all day the iron wheels go onward as if fate in each were stark and the children 's souls which god is calling sunward spin on blindly in the dark now tell the poor young children o my brothers to look up to him and pray — so the blessed one who blesseth all the others will bless them another day they answer `` who is god that he should hear us while the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred when we sob aloud the human creatures near us pass by hearing not or answer not a word and we hear not for the wheels in their resounding strangers speaking at the door is it likely god with angels singing round him hears our weeping any more '' two words indeed of praying we remember and at midnight 's hour of harm — 'our father looking upward in the chamber we say softly for a charm we know no other words except 'our father and we think that in some pause of angels song god may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather and hold both within his right hand which is strong 'our father if he heard us he would surely for they call him good and mild answer smiling down the steep world very purely 'come and rest with me my child `` but no '' say the children weeping faster `` he is speechless as a stone and they tell us of his image is the master who commands us to work on go to `` say the children — '' up in heaven dark wheel-like turning clouds are all we find do not mock us grief has made us unbelieving — we look up for god but tears have made us blind '' do ye hear the children weeping and disproving o my brothers what ye preach for god 's possible is taught by his world 's loving — and the children doubt of each and well may the children weep before you they are weary ere they run they have never seen the sunshine nor the glory which is brighter than the sun they know the grief of man without its wisdom they sink in the despair without its calm — are slaves without the liberty in christdom — are martyrs by the pang without the palm — are worn as if with age yet unretrievingly no dear remembrance keep — are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly let them weep let them weep they look up with their pale and sunken faces and their look is dread to see for they think you see their angels in their places with eyes meant for deity — '' how long '' they say `` how long o cruel nation will you stand to move the world on a child 's heart — stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation and tread onward to your throne amid the mart our blood splashes upward o our tyrants and your purple shews your path but the child 's sob curseth deeper in the silence than the strong man in his wrath ''
suppose it is nothing but the hive that there are drones and workers and queens and nothing but storing honey — material things as well as culture and wisdom — for the next generation this generation never living except as it swarms in the sun-light of youth strengthening its wings on what has been gathered and tasting on the way to the hive from the clover field the delicate spoil suppose all this and suppose the truth that the nature of man is greater than nature 's need in the hive and you must bear the burden of life as well as the urge from your spirit 's excess — well i say to live it out like a god sure of immortal life though you are in doubt is the way to live it if that does n't make god proud of you then god is nothing but gravitation or sleep is the golden goal

that was a great compliment the greeks paid to human life when they imagined their gods living as humans do with the same pleasure in love and feasting headstrong as we are turbulent quick to anger slow to forgive just like us only immortal and now that those gods have proven mortal too and heaven and earth can ’ t be divided every death means a divine occasion has been taken from us a divine perspective though the loss gets only a line or two in the news hard to believe the headlines this morning that a banker on mt olympus has been pilfering that a builder has been guilty of shoddy construction on a bridge that spans a river in heaven cutting corners to squirrel away his fortune for a better day when the great day has already come for news that heartens we must turn to the classifieds here in what ’ s left of heaven it ’ s right to advertise for a soul mate it ’ s right to look for a job that lets us incarnate spirit more fully and leave something behind that time is kinder to than the flesh of gods lucky there ’ s work lucky the streets of heaven are in need of repair paint is peeling from the dream-house trim holy rainwater backs up in leaf-clogged gutters till the ceiling sags and tiles need regrouting and look at the list of practical items for sale— used snowblowers croquet sets chainlink fencing and what about a wooden canoe with two paddles why don ’ t we make time for a turn before sundown out on the broad lake a breeze will find us that ’ s wafted around the planet to cool our divinity the clouds will hover above us in a giant halo as we watch our brother the sun descend his gentle face turned toward us his godly expression undarkened by accusation or disappointment or the thought of something he ’ s left undone
oh why is heaven built so far oh why is earth set so remote i can not reach the nearest star that hangs afloat i would not care to reach the moon one round monotonous of change yet even she repeats her tune beyond my range i never watch the scatter 'd fire of stars or sun 's far-trailing train but all my heart is one desire and all in vain for i am bound with fleshly bands joy beauty lie beyond my scope i strain my heart i stretch my hands and catch at hope
supposed of pamphylax the antiochene it is a parchment of my rolls the fifth hath three skins glued together is all greek and goeth from epsilon down to mu lies second in the surnamed chosen chest stained and conserved with juice of terebinth covered with cloth of hair and lettered xi from xanthus my wife 's uncle now at peace mu and epsilon stand for my own name i may not write it but i make a cross to show i wait his coming with the rest and leave off here beginneth pamphylax i said `` if one should wet his lips with wine '' and slip the broadest plantain-leaf we find '' or else the lappet of a linen robe '' into the water-vessel lay it right '' and cool his forehead just above the eyes '' the while a brother kneeling either side '' should chafe each hand and try to make it warm — '' he is not so far gone but he might speak '' this did not happen in the outer cave nor in the secret chamber of the rock where sixty days since the decree was out we had him bedded on a camel-skin and waited for his dying all the while but in the midmost grotto since noon 's light reached there a little and we would not lose the last of what might happen on his face i at the head and xanthus at the feet with valens and the boy had lifted him and brought him from the chamber in the depths and laid him in the light where we might see for certain smiles began about his mouth and his lids moved presageful of the end beyond and half way up the mouth o the cave the bactrian convert having his desire kept watch and made pretence to graze a goat that gave us milk on rags of various herb plantain and quitch the rocks shade keeps alive so that if any thief or soldier passed because the persecution was aware yielding the goat up promptly with his life such man might pass on joyful at a prize nor care to pry into the cool o the cave outside was all noon and the burning blue `` here is wine '' answered xanthus —dropped a drop i stooped and placed the lap of cloth aright then chafed his right hand and the boy his left but valens had bethought him and produced and broke a ball of nard and made perfume only he did—not so much wake as—turn and smile a little as a sleeper does if any dear one call him touch his face— and smiles and loves but will not be disturbed then xanthus said a prayer but still he slept it is the xanthus that escaped to rome was burned and could not write the chronicle then the boy sprang up from his knees and ran stung by the splendour of a sudden thought and fetched the seventh plate of graven lead out of the secret chamber found a place pressing with finger on the deeper dints and spoke as 'twere his mouth proclaiming first '' i am the resurrection and the life '' whereat he opened his eyes wide at once and sat up of himself and looked at us and thenceforth nobody pronounced a word only outside the bactrian cried his cry like the lone desert-bird that wears the ruff as signal we were safe from time to time first he said `` if a friend declared to me '' this my son valens this my other son '' were james and peter —nay declared as well '' this lad was very john —i could believe `` —could for a moment doubtlessly believe '' so is myself withdrawn into my depths '' the soul retreated from the perished brain '' whence it was wont to feel and use the world '' through these dull members done with long ago `` yet i myself remain i feel myself '' and there is nothing lost let be awhile '' this is the doctrine he was wont to teach how divers persons witness in each man three souls which make up one soul first to wit a soul of each and all the bodily parts seated therein which works and is what does and has the use of earth and ends the man downward but tending upward for advice grows into and again is grown into by the next soul which seated in the brain useth the first with its collected use and feeleth thinketh willeth —is what knows which duly tending upward in its turn grows into and again is grown into by the last soul that uses both the first subsisting whether they assist or no and constituting man 's self is what is— and leans upon the former makes it play as that played off the first and tending up holds is upheld by god and ends the man upward in that dread point of intercourse nor needs a place for it returns to him what does what knows what is three souls one man i give the glossa of theotypas and then `` a stick once fire from end to end '' now ashes save the tip that holds a spark `` yet blow the spark it runs back spreads itself '' a little where the fire was thus i urge '' the soul that served me till it task once more '' what ashes of my brain have kept their shape '' and these make effort on the last o the flesh '' trying to taste again the truth of things— '' he smiled — '' their very superficial truth '' as that ye are my sons that it is long '' since james and peter had release by death '' and i am only he your brother john '' who saw and heard and could remember all `` remember all it is not much to say `` what if the truth broke on me from above '' as once and oft-times such might hap again '' doubtlessly he might stand in presence here '' with head wool-white eyes flame and feet like brass '' the sword and the seven stars as i have seen— '' i who now shudder only and surmise '' how did your brother bear that sight and live `` if i live yet it is for good more love '' through me to men be nought but ashes here '' that keep awhile my semblance who was john — '' still when they scatter there is left on earth '' no one alive who knew consider this `` —saw with his eyes and handled with his hands '' that which was from the first the word of life `` how will it be when none more saith 'i saw `` such ever was love 's way to rise it stoops `` since i whom christ 's mouth taught was bidden teach '' i went for many years about the world '' saying 'it was so so i heard and saw '' speaking as the case asked and men believed `` afterward came the message to myself '' in patmos isle i was not bidden teach '' but simply listen take a book and write '' nor set down other than the given word '' with nothing left to my arbitrament '' to choose or change i wrote and men believed `` then for my time grew brief no message more '' no call to write again i found a way '' and reasoning from my knowledge merely taught '' men should for love 's sake in love 's strength believe '' or i would pen a letter to a friend '' and urge the same as friend nor less nor more '' friends said i reasoned rightly and believed `` but at the last why i seemed left alive '' like a sea jelly weak on patmos strand '' to tell dry sea-beach gazers how i fared '' when there was mid-sea and the mighty things '' left to repeat 'i saw i heard i knew '' and go all over the old ground again '' with antichrist already in the world '' and many antichrists who answered prompt '' am i not jasper as thyself art john '' nay young whereas through age thou mayest forget '' wherefore explain or how shall we believe `` i never thought to call down fire on such '' or as in wonderful and early days '' pick up the scorpion tread the serpent dumb '' but patient stated much of the lord 's life '' forgotten or misdelivered and let it work '' since much that at the first in deed and word '' lay simply and sufficiently exposed '' had grown or else my soul was grown to match '' fed through such years familiar with such light '' guarded and guided still to see and speak '' of new significance and fresh result '' what first were guessed as points i now knew stars '' and named them in the gospel i have writ `` for men said 'it is getting long ago '' where is the promise of his coming '—asked '' these young ones in their strength as loth to wait '' of me who when their sires were born was old `` i for i loved them answered joyfully '' since i was there and helpful in my age '' and in the main i think such men believed `` finally thus endeavouring i fell sick '' ye brought me here and i supposed the end '' and went to sleep with one thought that at least '' though the whole earth should lie in wickedness '' we had the truth might leave the rest to god `` yet now i wake in such decrepitude '' as i had slidden down and fallen afar '' past even the presence of my former self '' grasping the while for stay at facts which snap '' till i am found away from my own

dispread as though a star should open out all sides grow the world on you as it is my world `` for life with all it yields of joy and woe '' and hope and fear —believe the aged friend — is just our chance o the prize of learning love '' how love might be hath been indeed and is '' and that we hold thenceforth to the uttermost '' such prize despite the envy of the world and having gained truth keep truth that is all `` but see the double way wherein we are led '' how the soul learns diversely from the flesh `` with flesh that hath so little time to stay '' and yields mere basement for the soul 's emprise '' expect prompt teaching helpful was the light '' and warmth was cherishing and food was choice '' to every man 's flesh thousand years ago '' as now to yours and mine the body sprang

ages —give us fire '' thereafter we judge fire at its full worth '' and guard it safe through every chance ye know `` that fable of prometheus and his theft '' how mortals gained jove 's fiery flower grows old '' i have been used to hear the pagans own '' and out of mind but fire howe'er its birth '' here is it precious to the sophist now '' who laughs the myth of æschylus to scorn '' as precious to those satyrs of his play '' who touched it in gay wonder at the thing `` while were it so with the soul —this gift of truth '' once grasped were this our soul 's gain safe and sure '' to prosper as the body 's gain is wont — '' why man 's probation would conclude his earth '' crumble for he both reasons and decides '' weighs first then chooses will he give up fire '' for gold or purple once he knows its worth `` could he give christ up were his worth as plain `` therefore i say to test man the proofs shift '' nor may he grasp that fact like other fact '' and straightway in his life

work '' whereby truth deadened of its absolute blaze '' might need love 's eye to pierce the o'erstretched doubt `` teachers were busy whispering 'all is true '' as the aged ones report but youth can reach '' where age gropes dimly weak with stir and strain '' and the full doctrine slumbers till to-day `` thus what the roman 's lowered spear was found '' a bar to me who touched and handled truth '' now proved the glozing of some new shrewd tongue '' this ebion this cerinthus or their mates '' till imminent was the outcry save our christ `` whereon i stated much of the lord 's life '' forgotten or misdelivered and let it work `` such work done as it will be what comes next `` what do i hear say or conceive men say '' was john at all and did he say he saw '' assure us ere we ask

where now the larks sing in a solitude '' or muse upon blank heaps of stone and sand '' idly conjectured to be ephesus '' and no one asks his fellow any more '' where is the promise of his coming but '' was he revealed in any of his lives '' as power as love as influencing soul `` quick for time presses tell the whole mind out '' and let us ask and answer and be saved `` my book speaks on because

'' first of the love then we acknowledge christ— '' a proof we comprehend his love a proof '' we had such love already in ourselves '' knew first what else we should not recognize.

1 one day the amarous lisander by an impatient passion sway 'd surpris 'd fair cloris that lov 'd maid who cou 'd defend her self no longer all things did with his love conspire the gilded planet of the day in his gay chariot drawn by fire was now descending to the sea and left no light to guide the world but what from cloris brighter eyes was hurl 'd 2 in alone thicket made for love silent as yielding maids consent she with a charming languishment permits his force yet gently strove her hands his bosom softly meet but not to put him back design 'd rather to draw him on inclin 'd whilst he lay trembling at her feet resistance 't is to late to shew she wants the pow'r to say — ah what do you do 3 her bright eyes sweat and yet severe where love and shame confus'dly strive fresh vigor to lisander give and whispring softly in his ear she cry 'd — cease — cease — your vain desire or i 'll call out — what wou 'd you do my dearer honour ev'n to you i can not — must not give — retire or take that life whose chiefest part i gave you with the conquest of my heart 4 but he as much unus 'd to fear as he was capable of love the blessed minutes to improve kisses her lips her neck her hair each touch her new desires alarms his burning trembling hand he prest upon her melting snowy breast while she lay panting in his arms all her unguarded beauties lie the spoils and trophies of the enemy 5 and now without respect or fear he seeks the objects of his vows his love no modesty allows by swift degrees advancing where his daring hand that alter seiz 'd where gods of love do sacrifice that awful throne that paradise where rage is tam 'd and anger pleas 'd that living fountain from whose trills the melted soul in liquid drops distils 6 her balmy lips encountring his their bodies as their souls are joyn 'd where both in transports were confin 'd extend themselves upon the moss cloris half dead and breathless lay her eyes appear 'd like humid light such as divides the day and night or falling stars whose fires decay and now no signs of life she shows but what in short-breath-sighs returns and goes 7 he saw how at her length she lay he saw her rising bosom bare her loose thin robes through which appear a shape design 'd for love and play abandon 'd by her pride and shame she do 's her softest sweets dispence offring her virgin-innocence a victim to loves sacred flame whilst th or'e ravish 'd shepherd lies unable to perform the sacrifice 8 ready to taste a thousand joys thee too transported hapless swain found the vast pleasure turn 'd to pain pleasure which too much love destroys the willing garments by he laid and heav'n all open to his view mad to possess himself he threw on the defenceless lovely maid but oh what envious gods conspire to snatch his pow'r yet leave him the desire 9 natures support without whose aid she can no humane being give it self now wants the art to live faintness it slacken 'd nerves invade in vain th enraged youth assaid to call his fleeting vigour back no motion 'twill from motion take excess of love his love betray 'd in vain he toils in vain commands th insensible fell weeping in his hands 10 in this so am'rous cruel strife where love and fate were too severe the poor lisander in despair renounc 'd his reason with his life now all the brisk and active fire that should the nobler part inflame unactive frigid dull became and left no spark for new desire not all her naked charms cou 'd move or calm that rage that had debauch 'd his love 11 cloris returning from the trance which love and soft desire had bred her tim'rous hand she gently laid or guided by design or chance upon that fabulous priapus that potent god as poets feign but never did young shepherdess gath'ring of fern upon the plain more nimbly draw her fingers back finding beneath the verdant leaves a snake 12 then cloris her fair hand withdrew finding that god of her desires disarm 'd of all his pow'rful fires and cold as flow'rs bath 'd in the morning-dew who can the nymphs confusion guess the blood forsook the kinder place and strew 'd with blushes all her face which both disdain and shame express and from lisanders arms she fled leaving him fainting on the gloomy bed 13 like lightning through the grove she hies or daphne from the delphick god no print upon the grassie road she leaves t instruct pursuing eyes the wind that wanton 'd in her hair and with her ruffled garments plaid discover 'd in the flying maid all that the gods e 're made of fair so venus when her love was slain with fear and haste flew o 're the fatal plain 14 the nymphs resentments none but i can well imagin and condole but none can guess lisander 's soul but those who sway 'd his destiny his silent griefs swell up to storms and not one god his fury spares he curst his birth his fate his stars but more the shepherdesses charms whose soft bewitching influence had damn 'd him to the hell of impotence
once warring factions agreed upon the date and final form the apocalypse would take and whether dogs and cats and certain trees deserved to sail and if the dead would come or be left a forwarding address then opposing soldiers met on ravaged plains to shake hands and postulate the exact shade of the astral self—some said lavender others gray and physicists rocketed copies of the decree to paradise in case god had anything to say the silence that followed being taken for consent and so citizens readied for celestial ascent those who hated the idea stayed indoors till the appointed day when the moon clicked over the sun like a black lens over a white eye they stepped out onto porches and balconies to see the human shapes twist and rise through violet sky and hear trees uproot with a sound like enormous zippers unfastening and when the last grassblades filled the air the lonely vigilants fell in empty fields to press their bodies hard into dirt hugging their own outlines then the creator peered down from his perch as the wind of departing souls tore the hair of those remaining into wild coronas and he mourned for them as a father for defiant children and he knew that each small skull held if not some vision of his garden then its aroma of basil and tangerine washed over by the rotting sea they alone sensed what he ’ d wanted as he first stuck his shovel into clay and flung the planets over his shoulder or used his thumbnail to cut smiles and frowns on the first blank faces even as the saints arrived to line before his throne singing and a wisteria poked its lank blossoms through the cloudbank at his feet he trained his gaze on the deflating globe where the last spreadeagled xs clung like insects then vanished in puffs of luminous smoke which traveled a long way to sting his nostrils the journey lasting more than ten lifetimes a mauve vine corkscrewed up from the deep oblivion carrying the singed fume of things beautiful noble and wrong

teach me my god and king in all things thee to see and what i do in anything to do it as for thee not rudely as a beast to run into an action but still to make thee prepossest and give it his perfection a man that looks on glass on it may stay his eye or if he pleaseth through it pass and then the heav'n espy all may of thee partake nothing can be so mean which with his tincture— '' for thy sake '' — will not grow bright and clean a servant with this clause makes drudgery divine who sweeps a room as for thy laws makes that and th action fine this is the famous stone that turneth all to gold for that which god doth touch and own can not for less be told
this little silent gloomy monument contains all that was sweet and innocent the softest pratler that e'er found a tongue his voice was musick and his words a song which now each list'ning angel smiling hears such pretty harmonies compose the spheres wanton as unfledg 'd cupids ere their charms has learn 'd the little arts of doing harms fair as young cherubins as soft and kind and tho translated could not be refin 'd the seventh dear pledge the nuptial joys had given toil 'd here on earth retir 'd to rest in heaven where they the shining host of angels fill spread their gay wings before the throne and smile
i accompany this life ’ s events like a personal journalist “ little did she know when she got in the car that afternoon ... ” or “ despite inauspicious beginnings this was to be their happiest year. ” little did i expect that our horoscopes would prove true and how could we foresee an answer to that frankly secular prayer we with so little faith as to be false prophets to our most fortunate gifts i am glad when doom fails inept apocalypse is a specialty of the times the suffering of the rich at the hand of riches the second and third comings of wars shouldn ’ t we refuse prediction that the untried today is guilty that immeasurable as this child ’ s hope is it will break tomorrow
1914 the phantoms flit before our dazzled eyes glory and honour wrath and righteousness the agèd phantoms in their bloodstained dress vultures that fill the world with ravenous cries swarming about the rock where chained apart in age-long pain prometheus finds no rest from the divine flame burning in his breast and vultures tearing at a human heart not yet the blessed hours on golden wings bring to the crucified their sure relief deeper and deeper grows the ancient grief blackest of all intolerable things eternal rebel sad and old and blind bound with a chain enslaved by every one of the dark gods who hide the summer sun yet art thou still the saviour of mankind free soul of fire break down their chains and bars drive out those unclean phantoms of the brain till every living thing be friends again and our lost earth true comrade to the stars
by the stream where the ground is soft and gives under the slightest pressure—even the fly would leave its footprint here and the paw of the shrew the crescent of its claws like the strokes of a chisel in clay where the lightest chill lighter than the least rumor of winter sets the reeds to a kind of speaking and a single drop of rain leaves a crater to catch the first silver glint of sun when the clouds slide away from each other like two tired lovers and the light returns pale though brightened by the last chapter of late autumn copper rusted oak gold aspen and the red pages of maple the wind leafing through to the end the annals of beech the slim volumes of birch the elegant script of the ferns ... for the birds it is all notations for a coda for the otter an invitation to the river and for the deer—a dream in which to disappear light-footed on the still open book of earth adding the marks of their passage adding it all in waiting only for the first thick flurry of snowflakes for cover soft cover that carries no title no name
it was midday before we noticed it was morning the boy cousins brought us a tray—soup and cheese warm soda and a soft cloth and candy for her fever they wouldn ’ t come in the tray weighing between them they stood like woodwork inside the door frame by afternoon the old procession—silence at the lip of a dozen night travelers tired and grieving one by one or pairs floating to the bed and back with a touching of hands like humming and the one we gathered for slipping farther for all the good we could do she lay in her shadow she looked to no one her daylilies bobbed wide open out in the wild blue sun and the same bee kept nosing her window to reach them dusk even the boys were back watching it try
what are we bound for what ’ s the yield of all this energy and waste why do we spend ourselves and build with such an empty haste wherefore the bravery we boast how can we spend one laughing breath when at the end all things are lost in ignorance and death the stars have found a blazing course in a vast curve that cuts through space enough for us to feel that force swinging us through the days enough that we have strength to sing and fight and somehow scorn the grave that life ’ s too bold and bright a thing to question or to save
little soul do you remember you once walked over wooden boards to a house that sat on stilts in the sea it was early the sun painted brightness onto the water and wherever you sat that path led directly to you some mornings the sea-road was muted scratched tin some mornings blinding then it would leave little soul it is strange — even now it is early
a poem in seven parts 1 convent my knees recall the pockets worn into the stone floor my hands tracing against the wall their original name remember the cold brush of brick and the smell of the brick powdery and wet and the light finding its way in through the high bars and also the sisters singing at matins their sweet music the voice of the universe at peace and the candles their light the light at the beginning of creation and the wonderful simplicity of prayer smooth along the wooden beads and certainly attended 2 someone inside me remembers that my knees must be hidden away that my hair must be shorn so that vanity will not test me that my fingers are places of prayer and are holy that my body is promised to something more certain than myself 3 again born in the year of war on the day of perpetual help come from the house of stillness through the soft gate of a silent mother come to a betraying father come to a husband who would one day rise and enter a holy house come to wrestle with you again passion old disobedient friend through the secular days and nights of another life 4 trying to understand this life who did i fail who did i cease to protect that i should wake each morning facing the cold north perhaps there is a cart somewhere in history of children crying “ sister save us ” as she walks away the woman walks into my dreams dragging her old habit i turn from her shivering to begin another afternoon of rescue rescue 5 sinnerman horizontal one evening on the cold stone my cross burning into my breast did i dream through my veil of his fingers digging and is this the dream again him collarless over me calling me back to the stones of this world and my own whispered hosanna 6 karma the habit is heavy you feel its weight pulling around your ankles for a hundred years the broken vows hang against your breasts each bead a word that beats you even now to hear the words defend protect goodbye lost or alone is to be washed in sorrow and in this life there is no retreat no sanctuary no whole abiding sister 7 gloria mundi so knowing what is known that we carry our baggage in our cupped hands when we burst through the waters of our mother that some are born and some are brought to the glory of this world that it is more difficult than faith to serve only one calling one commitment one devotion in one life

stare hard enough at the fabric of night and if you 're predisposed to dark—let ’ s say the window you ’ ve picked is a black postage stamp you spend hours at sleepless drinking gin after the i love lucy reruns have gone off—stare like your eyes have force and behind any night ’ s taut scrim will come the forms you expect pressing from the other side for you a field of skulls angled jaws and eye-sockets a zillion scooped-out crania they ’ re plain once you think to look you know such fields exist for criminals roam your very block and even history lists monsters like adolf and uncle joe who stalk the earth ’ s orb plus minor baby-eaters unidentified probably in your very midst perhaps that disgruntled mail clerk from your job has already scratched your name on a bullet—that ’ s him rustling in the azaleas you caress the thought for it proves there ’ s no better spot for you than here your square-yard of chintz sofa hearing the bad news piped steady from your head the night is black you stare and furious stare confident there are no gods out there in this way you ’ re blind to your own eye ’ s intricate machine and to the light it sees by to the luck of birth and all your remembered loves if the skulls are there— let ’ s say they do press toward you against night ’ s scrim—could they not stare with slack jawed envy at the fine flesh that covers your scalp the numbered hairs at the force your hands hold

the child i left your class to have later had a habit of sleeping with her arms around a globe she ’ d unscrewed dropped and dented i always felt she could possess it the pink countries and the mauve and the ocean which got to keep its blue coming from the southern hemisphere to teach which you had never had to do you took a bare-walled room alone its northern windowscapes as gray as walls to decorate you ’ d only brought a black madonna i thought you must have skipped summer that year southern winter southern spring then north for winter over again still it pleased you to take credit for introducing us and later to bring our daughter a small flipbook of partners dancing and a ring with a secret whistle —all are broken now like her globe but she remembers them as i recall the black madonna facing you across the room so that in a way you had the dark fertile life you were always giving gifts to your smaller admirer off to school i take the globe and roll it away where on it now is someone like you
others taunt me with having knelt at well-curbs always wrong to the light so never seeing deeper down in the well than where the water gives me back in a shining surface picture me myself in the summer heaven godlike looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs once when trying with chin against a well-curb i discerned as i thought beyond the picture through the picture a something white uncertain something more of the depths—and then i lost it water came to rebuke the too clear water one drop fell from a fern and lo a ripple shook whatever it was lay there at bottom blurred it blotted it out what was that whiteness truth a pebble of quartz for once then something
introduction lo now four other acts upon the stage childhood and youth the manly and old-age the first son unto phlegm grand-child to water unstable supple moist and cold ’ s his nature the second frolic claims his pedigree from blood and air for hot and moist is he the third of fire and choler is compos ’ d vindicative and quarrelsome dispos ’ d the last of earth and heavy melancholy solid hating all lightness and all folly childhood was cloth ’ d in white and given to show his spring was intermixed with some snow upon his head a garland nature set of daisy primrose and the violet such cold mean flowers as these blossom betime before the sun hath throughly warm ’ d the clime his hobby striding did not ride but run and in his hand an hour-glass new begun in dangers every moment of a fall and when ‘ tis broke then ends his life and all but if he held till it have run its last then may he live till threescore years or past next youth came up in gorgeous attire as that fond age doth most of all desire his suit of crimson and his scarf of green in ’ s countenance his pride quickly was seen garland of roses pinks and gillyflowers seemed to grow on ’ s head bedew ’ d with showers his face as fresh as is aurora fair when blushing first she ‘ gins to red the air no wooden horse but one of metal try ’ d he seems to fly or swim and not to ride then prancing on the stage about he wheels but as he went death waited at his heels the next came up in a more graver sort as one that cared for a good report his sword by ’ s side and choler in his eyes but neither us ’ d as yet for he was wise of autumn fruits a basket on his arm his golden rod in ’ s purse which was his charm and last of all to act upon this stage leaning upon his staff comes up old age under his arm a sheaf of wheat he bore a harvest of the best what needs he more in ’ s other hand a glass ev ’ n almost run this writ about this out then i am done his hoary hairs and grave aspect made way and all gave ear to what he had to say these being met each in his equipage intend to speak according to their age but wise old-age did with all gravity to childish childhood give precedency and to the rest his reason mildly told that he was young before he grew so old to do as he the rest full soon assents their method was that of the elements that each should tell what of himself he knew both good and bad but yet no more then ’ s true with heed now stood three ages of frail man to hear the child who crying thus began childhood ah me conceiv ’ d in sin and born in sorrow a nothing here to day but gone to morrow whose mean beginning blushing can ’ t reveal but night and darkness must with shame conceal my mother ’ s breeding sickness i will spare her nine months ’ weary burden not declare to shew her bearing pangs i should do wrong to tell that pain which can ’ t be told by tongue with tears into this world i did arrive my mother still did waste as i did thrive who yet with love and all alacity spending was willing to be spent for me with wayward cries i did disturb her rest who sought still to appease me with her breast with weary arms she danc ’ d and by by sung when wretched i ungrate had done the wrong when infancy was past my childishness did act all folly that it could express my silliness did only take delight in that which riper age did scorn and slight in rattles bables and such toyish stuff my then ambitious thoughts were low enough my high-born soul so straitly was confin ’ d that its own worth it did not know nor mind this little house of flesh did spacious count through ignorance all troubles did surmount yet this advantage had mine ignorance freedom from envy and from arrogance how to be rich or great i did not cark a baron or a duke ne ’ r made my mark nor studious was kings favours how to buy with costly presents or base flattery no office coveted wherein i might make strong my self and turn aside weak right no malice bare to this or that great peer nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear i gave no hand nor vote for death of life i ’ d nought to do ‘ twixt prince and peoples ’ strife no statist i nor marti ’ list i ’ th ’ field where e ’ re i went mine innocence was shield my quarrels not for diadems did rise but for an apple plumb or some such prize my strokes did cause no death nor wounds nor scars my little wrath did cease soon as my wars my duel was no challenge nor did seek my foe should weltering with his bowels reek i had no suits at law neighbours to vex nor evidence for land did me perplex i fear ’ d no storms nor all the winds that blows i had no ships at sea no fraughts to loose i fear ’ d no drought nor wet i had no crop nor yet on future things did place my hope this was mine innocence but oh the seeds lay raked up of all the cursed weeds which sprouted forth in my insuing age as he can tell that next comes on the stage but yet me let me relate before i go the sins and dangers i am subject to from birth stained with adam ’ s sinful fact from thence i ‘ gan to sin as soon as act a perverse will a love to what ’ s forbid a serpent ’ s sting in pleasing face lay hid a lying tongue as soon as it could speak and fifth commandment do daily break oft stubborn peevish sullen pout and cry then nought can please and yet i know not why as many was my sins so dangers too for sin brings sorrow sickness death and woe and though i miss the tossings of the mind yet griefs in my frail flesh i still do find what gripes of wind mine infancy did pain what tortures i in breeding teeth sustain what crudities my cold stomach hath bred whence vomits worms and flux have issued what breaches knocks and falls i daily have and some perhaps i carry to my grave sometimes in fire sometimes in water fall strangely preserv ’ d yet mind it not at all at home abroad my danger ’ s manifold that wonder ‘ tis my glass till now doth hold i ’ ve done unto my elders i give way for ‘ tis but little that a child can say youth my goodly clothing and beauteous skin declare some greater riches are within but what is best i ‘ ll first present to view and then the worst in a more ugly hue for thus to do we on this stage assemble then let not him which hath most craft dissemble mine education and my learning ‘ s such as might my self and others profit much with nurture trained up in virtue ‘ s schools of science arts and tongues i know the rules the manners of the court i likewise know nor ignorant what they in country do the brave attempts of valiant knights i prize that dare climb battlements rear ‘ d to the skies the snorting horse the trumpet drum i like the glist ‘ ring sword and well advanced pike i can not lie in trench before a town nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown i scorn the heavy corslet musket-proof i fly to catch the bullet that ‘ s aloof though thus in field at home to all most kind so affable that i do suit each mind i can insinuate into the breast and by my mirth can raise the heart deprest sweet music rapteth my harmonious soul and elevates my thoughts above the pole my wit my bounty and my courtesy makes all to place their future hopes on me this is my best but youth is known alas to be as wild as is the snuffing ass as vain as froth as vanity can be that who would see vain man may look on me my gifts abus ‘ d my education lost my woful parents ‘ longing hopes all crost my wit evaporates in merriment my valour in some beastly quarrel ‘ s spent martial deeds i love not ‘ cause they ’ re virtuous but doing so might seem magnanimous my lust doth hurry me to all that ’ s ill i know no law nor reason but my will sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse or stab the man in ’ s own defence that ’ s worse sometimes i cheat unkind a female heir of all at once who not so wise as fair trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue until her friends treasure and honour ’ s gone sometimes i sit carousing others ’ health until mine own be gone my wit and wealth from pipe to pot from pot to words and blows for he that loveth wine wanteth no woes days nights with ruffins roarers fiddlers spend to all obscenity my ears i bend all counsel hate which tends to make me wise and dearest friends count for mine enemies if any care i take ‘ tis to be fine for sure my suit more than my virtues shine if any time from company i spare ‘ tis spent in curling frisling up my hair some young adonais i do strive to be sardana pallas now survives in me cards dice and oaths concomitant i love to masques to plays to taverns still i move and in a word if what i am you ’ d hear seek out a british bruitish cavalier such wretch such monster am i but yet more i want a heart all this for to deplore thus thus alas i have mispent my time my youth my best my strength my bud and prime remembring not the dreadful day of doom nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come though dangers do attend me every hour and ghastly death oft threats me with her power sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken sometimes by agues all my body shaken sometimes by fevers all my moisture drinking my heart lies frying and my eyes are sinking sometimes the cough stitch painful pleurisy with sad affrights of death do menace me sometimes the loathsome pox my face be-mars with ugly marks of his eternal scars sometimes the frenzy strangely mads my brain that oft for it in bedlam i remain too many ’ s my diseases to recite that wonder ‘ tis i yet behold the light that yet my bed in darkness is not made and i in black oblivion ’ s den long laid of marrow full my bones of milk my breasts ceas ’ d by the gripes of serjeant death 's arrests thus i have said and what i ’ ve said you see childhood and youth is vain yea vanity middle age childhood and youth forgot sometimes i ’ ve seen and now am grown more staid that have been green what they have done the same was done by me as was their praise or shame so mine must be now age is more more good ye do expect but more my age the more is my defect but what ’ s of worth your eyes shall first behold and then a world of dross among my gold when my wild oats were sown and ripe and mown i then receiv ’ d a harvest of mine own my reason then bad judge how little hope such empty seed should yield a better crop i then with both hands graspt the world together thus out of one extreme into another but yet laid hold on virtue seemingly who climbs without hold climbs dangerously be my condition mean i then take pains my family to keep but not for gains if rich i ’ m urged then to gather more to bear me out i ’ th ’ world and feed the poor if a father then for children must provide but if none then for kindred near ally ’ d if noble then mine honour to maintain if not yet wealth nobility can gain for time for place likewise for each relation i wanted not my ready allegation yet all my powers for self-ends are not spent for hundreds bless me for my bounty sent whose loins i ’ ve cloth ’ d and bellies i have fed with mine own fleece and with my household bread yea justice i have done was i in place to cheer the good and wicked to deface the proud i crush ’ d th ’ oppressed i set free the liars curb ’ d but nourisht verity

obey as readily as could my leader say was i a laborer i wrought all day as cheerfully as ere i took my pay thus hath mine age in all sometimes done well sometimes mine age in all been worse than hell in meanness greatness riches poverty did toil did broil oppress ’ d did steal and lie was i as poor as poverty could be then baseness was companion unto me such scum as hedges and high-ways do yield as neither sow nor reap nor plant nor build if to agriculture i was ordain ’ d great labours sorrows crosses i sustain ’ d the early cock did summon but in vain my wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain for restless day and night i ’ m robb ’ d of sleep by cankered care who sentinel doth keep my weary breast rest from his toil can find but if i rest the more distrest my mind if happiness my sordidness hath found ‘ twas in the crop of my manured ground my fatted ox and my exuberous cow my fleeced ewe and ever farrowing sow to greater things i never did aspire my dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher if to be rich or great it was my fate how was i broil ’ d with envy and with hate greater than was the great ’ st was my desire and greater still did set my heart on fire if honour was the point to which i steer ’ d to run my hull upon disgrace i fear ’ d but by ambitious sails i was so carried that over flats and sands and rocks i hurried opprest and sunk and sack ’ d all in my way that did oppose me to my longed bay my thirst was higher than nobility and oft long ’ d sore to taste on royalty whence poison pistols and dread instruments have been curst furtherers of mine intents nor brothers nephews sons nor sires i ’ ve spar ’ d when to a monarchy my way they barr ’ d there set i rid my self straight out of hand of such as might my son or his withstand then heapt up gold and riches as the clay which others scatter like the dew in may sometimes vain-glory is the only bait whereby my empty school is lur ’ d and caught be i of worth of learning or of parts i judge i should have room in all men ’ s hearts and envy gnaws if any do surmount i hate for to be had in small account if bias like i ’ m stript unto my skin i glory in my wealth i have within thus good and bad and what i am you see now in a word what my diseases be the vexing stone in bladder and in reins torments me with intolerable pains the windy cholic oft my bowels rend to break the darksome prison where it ’ s penn ’ d the knotty gout doth sadly torture me and the restraining lame sciatica the quinsy and the fevers often distaste me and the consumption to the bones doth waste me subject to all diseases that ’ s the truth though some more incident to age or youth and to conclude i may not tedious be man at his best estate is vanity old age what you have been ev ’ n such have i before and all you say say i and something more babe 's innocence youth ’ s wildness i have seen and in perplexed middle-age have been sickness dangers and anxieties have past and on this stage am

undone i saw all peace at home terror to foes but ah i saw at last those eyes to close and then me thought the world at noon grew dark when it had lost that radiant sun-like spark in midst of griefs i saw some hopes revive for ‘ twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive i saw hopes dash ’ t our forwardness was shent and silenc ’ d we by act of parliament i ’ ve seen from rome an execrable thing a

may see much good these are no old wives ’ tales but this is truth we old men love to tell what ’ s done in youth but i return from whence i stept awry my memory is short and brain is dry my almond-tree gray hairs doth flourish now and back once straight begins apace to bow my grinders now are few my sight doth fail my skin is wrinkled and my cheeks are pale no more rejoice at music ’ s pleasant noise but do awake at the cock ’ s clanging voice i can not scent savours of pleasant meat nor sapors find in what i drink or eat my hands and arms once strong have lost their might i can not labour nor i can not fight my comely legs as nimble as the roe now stiff and numb can hardly creep or go my heart sometimes as fierce as lion bold now trembling and fearful sad and cold my golden bowl and silver cord e ’ re long shall both be broke by wracking death so strong i then shall go whence i shall come no more sons nephews leave my death for to deplore in pleasures and in labours i have found that earth can give no consolation sound to great to rich to poor to young or old to mean to noble fearful or to bold from king to beggar all degrees shall find but vanity vexation of the mind

zeal whatever rat there haps on his wrong hole and nip each softling of a wee white mouse weke weke that 's crept to keep him company aha you know your betters then you 'll take your hand away that 's fiddling on my throat and please to know me likewise who am i why one sir who is lodging with a friend three streets off—he 's a certain how d 'ye call master—a ... cosimo of the medici i the house that caps the corner boh you were best remember and tell me the day you 're hanged how you affected such a gullet's-gripe but you sir it concerns you that your knaves pick up a manner nor discredit you zooks are we pilchards that they sweep the streets and count fair price what comes into their net he 's judas to a tittle that man is just such a face why sir you make amends lord i 'm not angry bid your hang-dogs go drink out this quarter-florin to the health of the munificent house that harbours me and many more beside lads more beside and all 's come square again i 'd like his face— his elbowing on his comrade in the door with the pike and lantern —for the slave that holds john baptist 's head a-dangle by the hair with one hand `` look you now '' as who should say and his weapon in the other yet unwiped it 's not your chance to have a bit of chalk a wood-coal or the like or you should see yes i 'm the painter since you style me so what brother lippo 's doings up and down you know them and they take you like enough i saw the proper twinkle in your eye— 'tell you i liked your looks at very first let 's sit and set things straight now hip to haunch here 's spring come and the nights one makes up bands to roam the town and sing out carnival and i 've been three weeks shut within my mew a-painting for the great man saints and saints and saints again i could not paint all night— ouf i leaned out of window for fresh air there came a hurry of feet and little feet a sweep of lute strings laughs and whifts of song — flower o the broom take away love and our earth is a tomb flower o the quince i let lisa go and what good in life since flower o the thyme—and so on round they went scarce had they turned the corner when a titter like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight —three slim shapes and a face that looked up zooks sir flesh and blood that 's all i 'm made of into shreds it went curtain and counterpane and coverlet all the bed-furniture—a dozen knots there was a ladder down i let myself hands and feet scrambling somehow and so dropped and after them i came up with the fun hard by saint laurence hail fellow well met — flower o the rose if i 've been merry what matter who knows and so as i was stealing back again to get to bed and have a bit of sleep ere i rise up to-morrow and go work on jerome knocking at his poor old breast with his great round stone to subdue the flesh you snap me of the sudden ah i see though your eye twinkles still you shake your head— mine 's shaved—a monk you say—the sting 's in that if master cosimo announced himself mum 's the word naturally but a monk come what am i a beast for tell us now i was a baby when my mother died and father died and left me in the street i starved there god knows how a year or two on fig-skins melon-parings rinds and shucks refuse and rubbish one fine frosty day my stomach being empty as your hat the wind doubled me up and down i went old aunt lapaccia trussed me with one hand its fellow was a stinger as i knew and so along the wall over the bridge by the straight cut to the convent six words there while i stood munching my first bread that month '' so boy you 're minded '' quoth the good fat father wiping his own mouth 't was refection-time — '' to quit this very miserable world will you renounce '' `` the mouthful of bread '' thought i by no means brief they made a monk of me i did renounce the world its pride and greed palace farm villa shop and banking-house trash such as these poor devils of medici have given their hearts to—all at eight years old well sir i found in time you may be sure 'twas not for nothing—the good bellyful the warm serge and the rope that goes all round and day-long blessed idleness beside `` let 's see what the urchin 's fit for '' —that came next not overmuch their way i must confess such a to-do they tried me with their books lord they 'd have taught me latin in pure waste flower o the clove all the latin i construe is `` amo '' i love but mind you when a boy starves in the streets eight years together as my fortune was watching folk 's faces to know who will fling the bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires and who will curse or kick him for his pains — which gentleman processional and fine holding a candle to the sacrament will wink and let him lift a plate and catch the droppings of the wax to sell again or holla for the eight and have him whipped — how say i —nay which dog bites which lets drop his bone from the heap of offal in the street — why soul and sense of him grow sharp alike he learns the look of things and none the less for admonition from the hunger-pinch i had a store of such remarks be sure which after i found leisure turned to use i drew men 's faces on my copy-books scrawled them within the antiphonary 's marge joined legs and arms to the long music-notes found eyes and nose and chin for a 's and b 's and made a string of pictures of the world betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun on the wall the bench the door the monks looked black `` nay '' quoth the prior `` turn him out d 'ye say in no wise lose a crow and catch a lark what if at last we get our man of parts we carmelites like those camaldolese and preaching friars to do our church up fine and put the front on it that ought to be '' and hereupon he bade me daub away thank you my head being crammed the walls a blank never was such prompt disemburdening first every sort of monk the black and white i drew them fat and lean then folk at church from good old gossips waiting to confess their cribs of barrel-droppings candle-ends — to the breathless fellow at the altar-foot fresh from his murder safe and sitting there with the little children round him in a row of admiration half for his beard and half for that white anger of his victim 's son shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm signing himself with the other because of christ whose sad face on the cross sees only this after the passion of a thousand years till some poor girl her apron o'er her head which the intense eyes looked through came at eve on tiptoe said a word dropped in a loaf her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers the brute took growling prayed and so was gone i painted all then cried `` 't is ask and have choose for more 's ready `` —laid the ladder flat and showed my covered bit of cloister-wall the monks closed in a circle and praised loud till checked taught what to see and not to see being simple bodies — '' that 's the very man look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog that woman 's like the prior 's niece who comes to care about his asthma it 's the life '' but there my triumph 's straw-fire flared and funked their betters took their turn to see and say the prior and the learned pulled a face and stopped all that in no time `` how what 's here quite from the mark of painting bless us all faces arms legs and bodies like the true as much as pea and pea it 's devil's-game your business is not to catch men with show with homage to the perishable clay but lift them over it ignore it all make them forget there 's such a thing as flesh your business is to paint the souls of men— man 's soul and it 's a fire smoke no it 's not it 's vapour done up like a new-born babe— in that shape when you die it leaves your mouth it 's well what matters talking it 's the soul give us no more of body than shows soul here 's giotto with his saint a-praising god that sets us praising—why not stop with him why put all thoughts of praise out of our head with wonder at lines colours and what not paint the soul never mind the legs and arms rub all out try at it a second time oh that white smallish female with the breasts she 's just my niece herodias i would say — who went and danced and got men 's heads cut off have it all out '' now is this sense i ask a fine way to paint soul by painting body so ill the eye ca n't stop there must go further and ca n't fare worse thus yellow does for white when what you put for yellow 's simply black and any sort of meaning looks intense when all beside itself means and looks nought why ca n't a painter lift each foot in turn left foot and right foot go a double step make his flesh liker and his soul more like both in their order take the prettiest face the prior 's niece patron-saint—is it so pretty you ca n't discover if it means hope fear sorrow or joy wo n't beauty go with these suppose i 've made her eyes all right and blue ca n't i take breath and try to add life 's flash and then add soul and heighten them three-fold or say there 's beauty with no soul at all— i never saw it—put the case the same— if you get simple beauty and nought else you get about the best thing god invents that 's somewhat and you 'll find the soul you have missed within yourself when you return him thanks `` rub all out '' well well there 's my life in short and so the thing has gone on ever since i 'm grown a man no doubt i 've broken bounds you should not take a fellow eight years old and make him swear to never kiss the girls i 'm my own master paint now as i please— having a friend you see in the corner-house lord it 's fast holding by the rings in front— those great rings serve more purposes than just to plant a flag in or tie up a horse and yet the old schooling sticks the old grave eyes are peeping o'er my shoulder as i work the heads shake still— '' it 's art 's decline my son you 're not of the true painters great and old brother angelico 's the man you 'll find brother lorenzo stands his single peer fag on at flesh you 'll never make the third '' flower o the pine you keep your mistr ... manners and i 'll stick to mine i 'm not the third then bless us they must know do n't you think they 're the likeliest to know they with their latin so i swallow my rage clench my teeth suck my lips in tight and paint to please them—sometimes do and sometimes do n't for doing most there 's pretty sure to come a turn some warm eve finds me at my saints— a laugh a cry the business of the world— flower o the peach death for us all and his own life for each and my whole soul revolves the cup runs over the world and life 's too big to pass for a dream and i do these wild things in sheer despite and play the fooleries you catch me at in pure rage the old mill-horse out at grass after hard years throws up his stiff heels so although the miller does not preach to him the only good of grass is to make chaff what would men have do they like grass or no— may they or may n't they all i want 's the thing settled for ever one way as it is you tell too many lies and hurt yourself you do n't like what you only like too much you do like what if given you at your word you find abundantly detestable for me i think i speak as i was taught i always see the garden and god there a-making man 's wife and my lesson learned the value and significance of flesh i ca n't unlearn ten minutes afterwards you understand me i 'm a beast i know but see now—why i see as certainly as that the morning-star 's about to shine what will hap some day we 've a youngster here comes to our convent studies what i do slouches and stares and lets no atom drop his name is guidi—he 'll not mind the monks— they call him hulking tom he lets them talk— he picks my practice up—he 'll paint apace i hope so—though i never live so long i know what 's sure to follow you be judge you speak no latin more than i belike however you 're my man you 've seen the world —the beauty and the wonder and the power the shapes of things their colours lights and shades changes surprises —and god made it all —for what do you feel thankful ay or no for this fair town 's face yonder river 's line the mountain round it and the sky above much more the figures of man woman child these are the frame to what 's it all about to be passed over despised or dwelt upon wondered at oh this last of course —you say but why not do as well as say —paint these just as they are careless what comes of it god 's works—paint any one and count it crime to let a truth slip do n't object `` his works are here already nature is complete suppose you reproduce her— which you ca n't there 's no advantage you must beat her then '' for do n't you mark we 're made so that we love first when we see them painted things we have passed perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see and so they are better painted—better to us which is the same thing art was given for that god uses us to help each other so lending our minds out have you noticed now your cullion 's hanging face a bit of chalk and trust me but you should though how much more if i drew higher things with the same truth that were to take the prior 's pulpit-place interpret god to all of you oh oh it makes me mad to see what men shall do and we in our graves this world 's no blot for us nor blank it means intensely and means good to find its meaning is my meat and drink `` ay but you do n't so instigate to prayer '' strikes in the prior `` when your meaning 's plain it does not say to folk—remember matins or mind you fast next friday '' why for this what need of art at all a skull and bones two bits of stick nailed crosswise or what 's best a bell to chime the hour with does as well i painted a saint laurence six months since at prato splashed the fresco in fine style '' how looks my painting now the scaffold 's down '' i ask a brother `` hugely '' he returns— '' already not one phiz of your three slaves who turn the deacon off his toasted side but 's scratched and prodded to our heart 's content the pious people have so eased their own with coming to say prayers there in a rage we get on fast to see the bricks beneath expect another job this time next year for pity and religion grow i the crowd— your painting serves its purpose '' hang the fools —that is—you 'll not mistake an idle word spoke in a huff by a poor monk god wot tasting the air this spicy night which turns the unaccustomed head like chianti wine oh the church knows do n't misreport me now it 's natural a poor monk out of bounds should have his apt word to excuse himself and hearken how i plot to make amends i have bethought me i shall paint a piece ... there 's for you give me six months then go see something in sant ambrogio 's bless the nuns they want a cast o my office i shall paint god in the midst madonna and her babe ringed by a bowery flowery angel-brood lilies and vestments and white faces sweet as puff on puff of grated orris-root when ladies crowd to church at midsummer and then i the front of course a saint or two— saint john because he saves the florentines saint ambrose who puts down in black and white the convent 's friends and gives them a long day and job i must have him there past mistake the man of uz and us without the z painters who need his patience well all these secured at their devotion up shall come out of a corner when you least expect as one by a dark stair into a great light music and talking who but lippo i — mazed motionless and moonstruck—i 'm the man back i shrink—what is this i see and hear i caught up with my monk's-things by mistake my old serge gown and rope that goes all round i in this presence this pure company where 's a hole where 's a corner for escape then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing forward puts out a soft palm— '' not so fast '' —addresses the celestial presence `` nay— he made you and devised you after all though he 's none of you could saint john there draw— his camel-hair make up a painting brush we come to brother lippo for all that iste perfecit opus so all smile— i shuffle sideways with my blushing face under the cover of a hundred wings thrown like a spread of kirtles when you 're gay and play hot cockles all the doors being shut till wholly unexpected in there pops the hothead husband thus i scuttle off to some safe bench behind not letting go the palm of her the little lily thing that spoke the good word for me in the nick like the prior 's niece saint lucy i would say and so all 's saved for me and for the church a pretty picture gained go six months hence your hand sir and good-bye no lights no lights the street 's hushed and i know my own way back do n't fear me there 's the grey beginning zooks
at last i entered a long dark gallery catacomb-lined and ranged at the side were the bodies of men from far and wide who motion past were nevertheless not dead `` the sense of waiting here strikes strong everyone 's waiting waiting it seems to me what are you waiting for so long — what is to happen '' i said `` o we are waiting for one called god '' said they '' though by some the will or force or laws and vaguely by some the ultimate cause waiting for him to see us before we are clay yes waiting waiting for god to know it '' ... '' to know what '' questioned i `` to know how things have been going on earth and below it it is clear he must know some day '' i thereon asked them why `` since he made us humble pioneers of himself in consciousness of life 's tears it needs no mighty prophecy to tell that what he could mindlessly show his creatures he himself will know `` by some still close-cowled mystery we have reached feeling faster than he but he will overtake us anon if the world goes on ''
i. when his dogs leapt on actaeon he cried did he cry out —he flung his arm to command they tore his hand from the wrist stump tore guts from his belly through the tunic ripped the cry from his throat that ’ s how we know a god when the facts leap at the tenderest innards and we know the god is what we can ’ t change you stood over me as i woke i opened my eyes i saw that i ’ d seen and that it was too late the seeing of you in the doorway with weak electric light fanning behind you in the hall and my room and narrow pallet steeped in shadow were what i couldn ’ t change and distantly i wanted you and as distantly i heard the dogs baying ii and yet the fountain spends itself and it is in the clear light of its losing that we seem to take delight you dipped your hand in its running braid to sprinkle my forehead my lips garden deities observed us three nymphs with moss staining their haunches a pug-nosed faun the wound in water closed perfectly around your gesture erasing it so that only the glimmer swiftly drying on my face recalled our interruption of the faultless cold passionate perpetual idea of the stream ’ s descent— which unlike ours would always be renewed iii i kissed a flame what did i expect those days you painted in fire tangerine gold one would have had to be a pilgrim to walk through that wall of molten glass and purification could be conceived if not attained only after many years in autumn in a fire greater than yours though menstrual blood still tinged the threshold and our ex-votos were sordid—scraps of blistered flesh taped to kitsch prayer cards—and neither of us knew the object of this exercise except having inadvertently each of us burned we recognized the smell of wood smoke the slow swirl flakes of wood ash make in heavy air and we were ready each in a private way to make the gifts the season required mine was the scene of my young self in your arms eyes in your eyes clutched in the effort to give each other away—when i glimpsed behind your pleasure fear behind fear anger and knew in a bolt some gifts conceal a greater gift i have kept it now i am ready to give it back into darker flame in this season of goldenrod the ardent weed and queen anne ’ s lace in its mantilla of ash and yet how lumpishly how stupidly i stand how much that is human will never burn iv and if you should answer i listened years before i knew you to the whine of wind through the high stony pastures above my childhood village i breathed lavender and thyme and burned my bare legs on nettles scraped them on thistles and rubbed the sore skin till it reddened all the more when we walked the uplands together you burned your hand and i kissed the crimsoning nettle-rash “ we are the lords of need ” you said hafiz said and i believed you and we were in the rugs of your country carmine is crushed from insects cochineal saffron gold is boiled from crocus stamens and indigo of heaven and fountain pools is soaked hours upon hours from indigo leaves “ like the angel harut ” you said “ we are in the calamity of love-desire. ” the angel is chained by neck and knees head down in the pit of babel for falling in love your carpets told a different story scarlet and saffron blush as in paradise and god reveals himself in wine flame tulips and the light in a mortal eye all night you held me sleepless on my childhood cot in the stone house all night the wind seethed through crags and twisted olive trees high on the scents of thyme and goat droppings “ all night ” hafiz sang “ i hope the breeze of dawn will cherish the lovers. ” but the breeze of dawn is the angel of death you are in your far landscape now i am in mine the wind complains and i can ’ t understand the words and if you should answer you ten years away in a different wind “ we are in the calamity ” hafiz sang “ but tell the tale of the minstrel and of wine and leave time alone time is a mystery no skill will solve. ” we should thread words like pearls you said and the grateful sky would scatter the pleiades upon us though we couldn ’ t see and that was long ago v. the carpet is not a story it is a place garden of crisscrossed pathways labyrinth fountain pool and stream as though the fabric had ripped at the vanishing point at the top of the street of ashen façades and slate-sloped roofs you stepped through the gap out of your own world i had already lost my world we met in a torn design which we tore further pulling the tall warp thread wrapped tightly around our fingers until it bit the flesh and the rue de lille unravelled i know about design it ’ s my job arranging other people ’ s letters in star charts that phosphoresce in the dark between the closed covers of books you knew about design from the holes blown through your country we spoke in a language of no country on earth you moved slowly in shadow teaching the shadows to echo my name you ripped my shirt at the neck was it the beloved i held holding you down the middle of the carpet the river weaves a thousand gray glimmers into the deeper green the river knows about mourning that ’ s its job how many years has it practiced with such fleet fingers a man woke me at dawn this morning sobbing and cursing in the street reeling from sidewalk to gutter and back again on my long gray street the rue de lille where i still live
tulsidas the poet was wandering deep in thought by the ganges in that lonely spot where they burn their dead he found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband gaily dressed as for a wedding she rose as she saw him bowed to him and said `` permit me master with your blessing to follow my husband to heaven '' `` why such hurry my daughter '' asked tulsidas `` is not this earth also his who made heaven '' `` for heaven i do not long '' said the woman `` i want my husband '' tulsidas smiled and said to her `` go back to your home my child before the month is over you will find your husband '' the woman went back with glad hope tulsidas came to her every day and gave her high thoughts to think till her heart was filled to the brim with divine love when the month was scarcely over her neighbours came to her asking `` woman have you found your husband '' the widow smiled and said `` i have '' eagerly they asked `` where is he '' `` in my heart is my lord one with me '' said the woman
you would think the fury of aerial bombardment would rouse god to relent the infinite spaces are still silent he looks on shock-pried faces history even does not know what is meant you would feel that after so many centuries god would give man to repent yet he can kill as cain could but with multitudinous will no farther advanced than in his ancient furies was man made stupid to see his own stupidity is god by definition indifferent beyond us all is the eternal truth man ’ s fighting soul wherein the beast ravens in its own avidity of van wettering i speak and averill names on a list whose faces i do not recall but they are gone to early death who late in school distinguished the belt feed lever from the belt holding pawl
a wanderer is man from his birth he was born in a ship on the breast of the river of time brimming with wonder and joy he spreads out his arms to the light rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream as what he sees is so have his thoughts been whether he wakes where the snowy mountainous pass echoing the screams of the eagles hems in its gorges the bed of the new-born clear-flowing stream whether he first sees light where the river in gleaming rings sluggishly winds through the plain whether in sound of the swallowing sea— as is the world on the banks so is the mind of the man vainly does each as he glides fable and dream of the lands which the river of time had left ere he woke on its breast or shall reach when his eyes have been closed only the tract where he sails he wots of only the thoughts raised by the objects he passes are his who can see the green earth any more as she was by the sources of time who imagines her fields as they lay in the sunshine unworn by the plough who thinks as they thought the tribes who then roam 'd on her breast her vigorous primitive sons what girl now reads in her bosom as clear as rebekah read when she sate at eve by the palm-shaded well who guards in her breast as deep as pellucid a spring of feeling as tranquil as sure what bard at the height of his vision can deem of god of the world of the soul with a plainness as near as flashing as moses felt when he lay in the night by his flock on the starlit arabian waste can rise and obey the beck of the spirit like him this tract which the river of time now flows through with us is the plain gone is the calm of its earlier shore border 'd by cities and hoarse with a thousand cries is its stream and we on its breast our minds are confused as the cries which we hear changing and shot as the sights which we see and we say that repose has fled for ever the course of the river of time that cities will crowd to its edge in a blacker incessanter line that the din will be more on its banks denser the trade on its stream flatter the plain where it flows fiercer the sun overhead that never will those on its breast see an ennobling sight drink of the feeling of quiet again but what was before us we know not and we know not what shall succeed haply the river of time— as it grows as the towns on its marge fling their wavering lights on a wider statelier stream— may acquire if not the calm of its early mountainous shore yet a solemn peace of its own and the width of the waters the hush of the grey expanse where he floats freshening its current and spotted with foam as it draws to the ocean may strike peace to the soul of the man on its breast— as the pale waste widens around him as the banks fade dimmer away as the stars come out and the night-wind brings up the stream murmurs and scents of the infinite sea

the world is charged with the grandeur of god it will flame out like shining from shook foil it gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil crushed why do men then now not reck his rod generations have trod have trod have trod and all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil and wears man 's smudge and shares man 's smell the soil is bare now nor can foot feel being shod and for all this nature is never spent there lives the dearest freshness deep down things and though the last lights off the black west went oh morning at the brown brink eastward springs — because the holy ghost over the bent world broods with warm breast and with ah bright wings
it must be troubling for the god who loves you to ponder how much happier you ’ d be today had you been able to glimpse your many futures it must be painful for him to watch you on friday evenings driving home from the office content with your week— three fine houses sold to deserving families— knowing as he does exactly what would have happened had you gone to your second choice for college knowing the roommate you ’ d have been allotted whose ardent opinions on painting and music would have kindled in you a lifelong passion a life thirty points above the life you ’ re living on any scale of satisfaction and every point a thorn in the side of the god who loves you you don ’ t want that a large-souled man like you who tries to withhold from your wife the day ’ s disappointments so she can save her empathy for the children and would you want this god to compare your wife with the woman you were destined to meet on the other campus it hurts you to think of him ranking the conversation you ’ d have enjoyed over there higher in insight than the conversation you ’ re used to and think how this loving god would feel knowing that the man next in line for your wife would have pleased her more than you ever will even on your best days when you really try can you sleep at night believing a god like that is pacing his cloudy bedroom harassed by alternatives you ’ re spared by ignorance the difference between what is and what could have been will remain alive for him even after you cease existing after you catch a chill running out in the snow for the morning paper losing eleven years that the god who loves you will feel compelled to imagine scene by scene unless you come to the rescue by imagining him no wiser than you are no god at all only a friend no closer than the actual friend you made at college the one you haven ’ t written in months sit down tonight and write him about the life you can talk about with a claim to authority the life you ’ ve witnessed which for all you know is the life you ’ ve chosen

for john holohan jesus wound up with his body nailed to a tree— a torment he practically begged for or at least did nothing to stop pilate watched the crowd go thumbs down and weary signed the order so centurions laid jesus flat on a long beam arms run along the crosspiece in each palm a long spike was centered a stone chosen to drive it skin tears the bones start to split once the cross got propped up the body hung heavy a carcass— in carne the latin poets say in meat —the breastbone a ship ’ s prow at the end the man cried out as men cry tears that fill the eyes grow dark drop and by drop one cries out on the third day the stone rolled back to reveal no corpse history is rife with such hoaxes look at herodotus as to whether he multiplied loaves and fishes that ’ s common enough poke seed-corn in a hole and see if more corn doesn ’ t grow two fish in a pond make more fishes the altar of reason supports such extravagance i don ’ t even know how electricity works but put trust in light switches and the prospect of love cheers me up as gospel that some creator might strap on an animal mask to travel our path between birth and ignominious death—now that makes me less lonely and the rising up at the end into glory—the white circle of bread on the meat of each tongue that god might enter us for 2000-near years my tribe has lined up at various altars so dumbly i open this mouth for bread and song
i don ’ t know somehow it seems sufficient to see and hear whatever coming and going is losing the self to the victory of stones and trees of bending sandpit lakes crescent round groves of dwarf pine for it is not so much to know the self as to know it as it is known by galaxy and cedar cone as if birth had never found it and death could never end it the swamp ’ s slow water comes down gravelly run fanning the long stone-held algal hair and narrowing roils between the shoulders of the highway bridge holly grows on the banks in the woods there and the cedars ’ gothic-clustered spires could make green religion in winter bones so i look and reflect but the air ’ s glass jail seals each thing in its entity no use to make any philosophies here i see no god in the holly hear no song from the snowbroken weeds hegel is not the winter yellow in the pines the sunlight has never heard of trees surrendered self among unwelcoming forms stranger hoist your burdens get on down the road
both of us had been close to joel and at joel ’ s death my friend had gone to the wake and the memorial service and more recently he had visited joel ’ s grave there at the back of the grassy cemetery among the trees “ a quiet gentle place ” he said “ befitting joel. ” and i said “ what ’ s the point of going to look at graves ” i went into one of my celebrated tirades “ people go to look at the grave of keats or hart crane they go traveling just to do it what a waste of time what do they find there hell i wouldn ’ t go look at the grave of shakespeare if it was just down the street i wouldn ’ t look at— ” and i stopped i was about to say the grave of god until i realized i ’ m looking at it all the time ...
some say it ’ s in the reptilian dance of the purple-tongued sand goanna for there the magnificent translation of tenacity into bone and grace occurs and some declare it to be an expansive desert—solid rust-orange rock like dusk captured on earth in stone— simply for the perfect contrast it provides to the blue-grey ridge of rain in the distant hills some claim the harmonics of shifting electron rings to be most rare and some the complex motion of seven sandpipers bisecting the arcs and pitches of come and retreat over the mounting hayfield others for grandeur choose the terror of lightning peals on prairies or the tall collapsing cathedrals of stormy seas because there they feel dwarfed and appropriately helpless others select the serenity of that ceiling/cellar of stars they see at night on placid lakes because there they feel assured and universally magnanimous but it is the dark emptiness contained in every next moment that seems to me the most singularly glorious gift that void which one is free to fill with processions of men bearing burning cedar knots or with parades of blue horses belled and ribboned and stepping sideways with tumbling white-faced mimes or companies of black-robed choristers to fill simply with hammered silver teapots or kiln-dried crockery tangerine and almond custards polonaises polkas whittling sticks wailing walls that space large enough to hold all invented blasphemies and pieties 10,000 definitions of god and more never fully filled never
if but some vengeful god would call to me from up the sky and laugh “ thou suffering thing know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy that thy love 's loss is my hate 's profiting ” then would i bear it clench myself and die steeled by the sense of ire unmerited half-eased in that a powerfuller than i had willed and meted me the tears i shed but not so how arrives it joy lies slain and why unblooms the best hope ever sown —crass casualty obstructs the sun and rain and dicing time for gladness casts a moan these purblind doomsters had as readily strown blisses about my pilgrimage as pain
i am that which began out of me the years roll out of me god and man i am equal and whole god changes and man and the form of them bodily i am the soul before ever land was before ever the sea or soft hair of the grass or fair limbs of the tree or the fresh-coloured fruit of my branches i was and thy soul was in me first life on my sources first drifted and swam out of me are the forces that save it or damn out of me man and woman and wild-beast and bird before god was i am beside or above me nought is there to go love or unlove me unknow me or know i am that which unloves me and loves i am stricken and i am the blow i the mark that is missed and the arrows that miss i the mouth that is kissed and the breath in the kiss the search and the sought and the seeker the soul and the body that is i am that thing which blesses my spirit elate that which caresses with hands uncreate my limbs unbegotten that measure the length of the measure of fate but what thing dost thou now looking godward to cry `` i am i thou art thou i am low thou art high '' i am thou whom thou seekest to find him find thou but thyself thou art i. i the grain and the furrow the plough-cloven clod and the ploughshare drawn thorough the germ and the sod the deed and the doer the seed and the sower the dust which is god hast thou known how i fashioned thee child underground fire that impassioned thee iron that bound dim changes of water what thing of all these hast thou known of or found canst thou say in thine heart thou hast seen with thine eyes with what cunning of art thou wast wrought in what wise by what force of what stuff thou wast shapen and shown on my breast to the skies who hath given who hath sold it thee knowledge of me hath the wilderness told it thee hast thou learnt of the sea hast thou communed in spirit with night have the winds taken counsel with thee have i set such a star to show light on thy brow that thou sawest from afar what i show to thee now have ye spoken as brethren together the sun and the mountains and thou what is here dost thou know it what was hast thou known prophet nor poet nor tripod nor throne nor spirit nor flesh can make answer but only thy mother alone mother not maker born and not made though her children forsake her allured or afraid praying prayers to the god of their fashion she stirs not for all that have prayed a creed is a rod and a crown is of night but this thing is god to be man with thy might to grow straight in the strength of thy spirit and live out thy life as the light i am in thee to save thee as my soul in thee saith give thou as i gave thee thy life-blood and breath green leaves of thy labour white flowers of thy thought and red fruit of thy death be the ways of thy giving as mine were to thee the free life of thy living be the gift of it free not as servant to lord nor as master to slave shalt thou give thee to me o children of banishment souls overcast were the lights ye see vanish meant alway to last ye would know not the sun overshining the shadows and stars overpast i that saw where ye trod the dim paths of the night set the shadow called god in your skies to give light but the morning of manhood is risen and the shadowless soul is in sight the tree many-rooted that swells to the sky with frondage red-fruited the life-tree am i in the buds of your lives is the sap of my leaves ye shall live and not die but the gods of your fashion that take and that give in their pity and passion that scourge and forgive they are worms that are bred in the bark that falls off they shall die and not live my own blood is what stanches the wounds in my bark stars caught in my branches make day of the dark and are worshipped as suns till the sunrise shall tread out their fires as a spark where dead ages hide under the live roots of the tree in my darkness the thunder makes utterance of me in the clash of my boughs with each other ye hear the waves sound of the sea that noise is of time as his feathers are spread and his feet set to climb through the boughs overhead and my foliage rings round him and rustles and branches are bent with his tread the storm-winds of ages blow through me and cease the war-wind that rages the spring-wind of peace ere the breath of them roughen my tresses ere one of my blossoms increase all sounds of all changes all shadows and lights on the world 's mountain-ranges and stream-riven heights whose tongue is the wind 's tongue and language of storm-clouds on earth-shaking nights all forms of all faces all works of all hands in unsearchable places of time-stricken lands all death and all life and all reigns and all ruins drop through me as sands though sore be my burden and more than ye know and my growth have no guerdon but only to grow yet i fail not of growing for lightnings above me or deathworms below these too have their part in me as i too in these such fire is at heart in me such sap is this tree 's which hath in it all sounds and all secrets of infinite lands and of seas in the spring-coloured hours when my mind was as may 's there brake forth of me flowers by centuries of days strong blossoms with perfume of manhood shot out from my spirit as rays and the sound of them springing and smell of their shoots were as warmth and sweet singing and strength to my roots and the lives of my children made perfect with freedom of soul were my fruits i bid you but be i have need not of prayer i have need of you free as your mouths of mine air that my heart may be greater within me beholding the fruits of me fair more fair than strange fruit is of faiths ye espouse in me only the root is that blooms in your boughs behold now your god that ye made you to feed him with faith of your vows in the darkening and whitening abysses adored with dayspring and lightning for lamp and for sword god thunders in heaven and his angels are red with the wrath of the lord o my sons o too dutiful toward gods not of me was not i enough beautiful was it hard to be free for behold i am with you am in you and of you look forth now and see lo winged with world 's wonders with miracles shod with the fires of his thunders for raiment and rod god trembles in heaven and his angels are white with the terror of god for his twilight is come on him his anguish is here and his spirits gaze dumb on him grown grey from his fear and his hour taketh hold on him stricken the last of his infinite year thought made him and breaks him truth slays and forgives but to you as time takes him this new thing it gives even love the beloved republic that feeds upon freedom and lives for truth only is living truth only is whole and the love of his giving man 's polestar and pole man pulse of my centre and fruit of my body and seed of my soul one

poetry is the supreme fiction madame take the moral law and make a nave of it and from the nave build haunted heaven thus the conscience is converted into palms like windy citherns hankering for hymns we agree in principle that 's clear but take the opposing law and make a peristyle and from the peristyle project a masque beyond the planets thus our bawdiness unpurged by epitaph indulged at last is equally converted into palms squiggling like saxophones and palm for palm madame we are where we began allow therefore that in the planetary scene your disaffected flagellants well-stuffed smacking their muzzy bellies in parade proud of such novelties of the sublime such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk may merely may madame whip from themselves a jovial hullabaloo among the spheres this will make widows wince but fictive things wink as they will wink most when widows wince

i would to god that mine old age might have before my last but here a living grave some one poor almshouse there to lie or stir ghost-like as in my meaner sepulchre a little piggin and a pipkin by to hold things fitting my necessity which rightly us 'd both in their time and place might me excite to fore and after grace thy cross my christ fix 'd 'fore mine eyes should be not to adore that but to worship thee so here the remnant of my days i 'd spend reading thy bible and my book so end
i threaten 'd to observe the strict decree of my dear god with all my power and might but i was told by one it could not be yet i might trust in god to be my light `` then will i trust '' said i `` in him alone '' `` nay e'en to trust in him was also his we must confess that nothing is our own '' `` then i confess that he my succour is '' `` but to have nought is ours not to confess that we have nought '' i stood amaz 'd at this much troubled till i heard a friend express that all things were more ours by being his what adam had and forfeited for all christ keepeth now who can not fail or fall
let through praise while cycling —a hill or shop to match you— the shining bay the foggy gray beneath all names and phrases let through praise while working —a bird or book to watch you— the formal sun the queerer ones lifting their heads to face you let through praise while flirting —a storm or song to patch you— the iced-down bruise the new black shoes and all the things that make you let praise through earthly city —a sibling glad to catch us— the blameless meek the faceless deep please mind your house and graces
walking among my own this windy morning in a tide of sunlight between shower and shower i resume my old conspiracy with the wet stone and the unwieldy images of the squinting heart once more as before i remember not to forget there is a perverse pride in being on the side of the fallen angels and refusing to get up we could all be saved by keeping an eye on the hill at the top of every street for there it is eternally if irrelevantly visible — but yield instead to the humorous formulae the spurious mystery in the knowing nod or we keep sullen silence in light and shade rehearsing our astute salvations under the cold gaze of a sanctimonious god one part of my mind must learn to know its place the things that happen in the kitchen houses and echoing back streets of this desperate city should engage more than my casual interest exact more interest than my casual pity
at the round earth 's imagin 'd corners blow your trumpets angels and arise arise from death you numberless infinities of souls and to your scatter 'd bodies go all whom the flood did and fire shall o'erthrow all whom war dearth age agues tyrannies despair law chance hath slain and you whose eyes shall behold god and never taste death 's woe but let them sleep lord and me mourn a space for if above all these my sins abound 'tis late to ask abundance of thy grace when we are there here on this lowly ground teach me how to repent for that 's as good as if thou'hadst seal 'd my pardon with thy blood
batter my heart three-person 'd god for you as yet but knock breathe shine and seek to mend that i may rise and stand o'erthrow me and bend your force to break blow burn and make me new i like an usurp 'd town to another due labor to admit you but oh to no end reason your viceroy in me me should defend but is captiv 'd and proves weak or untrue yet dearly i love you and would be lov 'd fain but am betroth 'd unto your enemy divorce me untie or break that knot again take me to you imprison me for i except you enthrall me never shall be free nor ever chaste except you ravish me
death be not proud though some have called thee mighty and dreadful for thou art not so for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me from rest and sleep which but thy pictures be much pleasure then from thee much more must flow and soonest our best men with thee do go rest of their bones and soul 's delivery thou art slave to fate chance kings and desperate men and dost with poison war and sickness dwell and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well and better than thy stroke why swell'st thou then one short sleep past we wake eternally and death shall be no more death thou shalt die
i am a little world made cunningly of elements and an angelic sprite but black sin hath betray 'd to endless night my world 's both parts and oh both parts must die you which beyond that heaven which was most high have found new spheres and of new lands can write pour new seas in mine eyes that so i might drown my world with my weeping earnestly or wash it if it must be drown 'd no more but oh it must be burnt alas the fire of lust and envy have burnt it heretofore and made it fouler let their flames retire and burn me o lord with a fiery zeal of thee and thy house which doth in eating heal
if poisonous minerals and if that tree whose fruit threw death on else immortal us if lecherous goats if serpents envious can not be damn 'd alas why should i be why should intent or reason born in me make sins else equal in me more heinous and mercy being easy and glorious to god in his stern wrath why threatens he but who am i that dare dispute with thee o god oh of thine only worthy blood and my tears make a heavenly lethean flood and drown in it my sins black memory that thou remember them some claim as debt i think it mercy if thou wilt forget
show me dear christ thy spouse so bright and clear what is it she which on the other shore goes richly painted or which robb 'd and tore laments and mourns in germany and here sleeps she a thousand then peeps up one year is she self-truth and errs now new now outwore doth she and did she and shall she evermore on one on seven or on no hill appear dwells she with us or like adventuring knights first travel we to seek and then make love betray kind husband thy spouse to our sights and let mine amorous soul court thy mild dove who is most true and pleasing to thee then when she'is embrac 'd and open to most men
since she whom i lov 'd hath paid her last debt to nature and to hers and my good is dead and her soul early into heaven ravished wholly in heavenly things my mind is set here the admiring her my mind did whet to seek thee god so streams do show the head but though i have found thee and thou my thirst hast fed a holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet but why should i beg more love whenas thou dost woo my soul for hers off'ring all thine and dost not only fear lest i allow my love to saints and angels things divine but in thy tender jealousy dost doubt lest the world flesh yea devil put thee out
this is my play 's last scene here heavens appoint my pilgrimage 's last mile and my race idly yet quickly run hath this last pace my span 's last inch my minute 's latest point and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint my body and my soul and i shall sleep a space but my'ever-waking part shall see that face whose fear already shakes my every joint then as my soul to'heaven her first seat takes flight and earth-born body in the earth shall dwell so fall my sins that all may have their right to where they'are bred and would press me to hell impute me righteous thus purg 'd of evil for thus i leave the world the flesh the devil
thou hast made me and shall thy work decay repair me now for now mine end doth haste i run to death and death meets me as fast and all my pleasures are like yesterday i dare not move my dim eyes any way despair behind and death before doth cast such terror and my feebled flesh doth waste by sin in it which it towards hell doth weigh only thou art above and when towards thee by thy leave i can look i rise again but our old subtle foe so tempteth me that not one hour i can myself sustain thy grace may wing me to prevent his art and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart
twas on a holy thursday their innocent faces clean the children walking two two in red blue green grey-headed beadles walkd before with wands as white as snow till into the high dome of pauls they like thames waters flow o what a multitude they seemd these flowers of london town seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own the hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs thousands of little boys girls raising their innocent hands now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor then cherish pity lest you drive an angel from your door
“ hope ” is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tune without the words and never stops at all and sweetest in the gale is heard and sore must be the storm that could abash the little bird that kept so many warm i ’ ve heard it in the chillest land and on the strangest sea yet never in extremity it asked a crumb of me
from child to youth from youth to arduous man from lethargy to fever of the heart from faithful life to dream-dower 'd days apart from trust to doubt from doubt to brink of ban — thus much of change in one swift cycle ran till now alas the soul —how soon must she accept her primal immortality — the flesh resume its dust whence it began o lord of work and peace o lord of life o lord the awful lord of will though late even yet renew this soul with duteous breath that when the peace is garner 'd in from strife the work retriev 'd the will regenerate this soul may see thy face o lord of death

look in my face my name is might-have-been i am also call 'd no-more too-late farewell unto thine ear i hold the dead-sea shell cast up thy life 's foam-fretted feet between unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen which had life 's form and love 's but by my spell is now a shaken shadow intolerable of ultimate things unutter 'd the frail screen mark me how still i am but should there dart one moment through thy soul the soft surprise of that wing 'd peace which lulls the breath of sighs — then shalt thou see me smile and turn apart thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart sleepless with cold commemorative eyes
four seasons fill the measure of the year there are four seasons in the mind of man he has his lusty spring when fancy clear takes in all beauty with an easy span he has his summer when luxuriously spring 's honied cud of youthful thought he loves to ruminate and by such dreaming high is nearest unto heaven quiet coves his soul has in its autumn when his wings he furleth close contented so to look on mists in idleness—to let fair things pass by unheeded as a threshold brook he has his winter too of pale misfeature or else he would forego his mortal nature

less the shadow than you a stag sudden through it less the stag breaking cover than the antlers with which crowned less the antlers as trees leafless to either side of the stag ’ s head than— between them—the vision that must mean surely rescue less the rescue more always the ache toward it when i think of death the gleam of the world darkening dark gathering me now in it is lately as one more of many other nights figured with the inevitably black car again the stranger ’ s strange room entered not for prayer but for striking prayer ’ s attitude the body kneeling bending until it finds the muscled patterns that predictably given strain and release flesh assumes when i think of desire it is in the same way that i do god as parable any steep and blue water things that are always there they only wait to be sounded and i a stone that a little bit perhaps should ask pardon my fears—when i have fears— are of how long i shall be falling and in my at last resting how indistinguishable inasmuch as they are countless sire all the unglittering other dropped stones
hast thou a charm to stay the morning-star in his steep course so long he seems to pause on thy bald awful head o sovran blanc the arve and arveiron at thy base rave ceaselessly but thou most awful form risest from forth thy silent sea of pines how silently around thee and above deep is the air and dark substantial black an ebon mass methinks thou piercest it as with a wedge but when i look again it is thine own calm home thy crystal shrine thy habitation from eternity o dread and silent mount i gazed upon thee till thou still present to the bodily sense didst vanish from my thought entranced in prayer i worshipped the invisible alone yet like some sweet beguiling melody so sweet we know not we are listening to it thou the meanwhile wast blending with my thought yea with my life and life 's own secret joy till the dilating soul enrapt transfused into the mighty vision passing—there as in her natural form swelled vast to heaven awake my soul not only passive praise thou owest not alone these swelling tears mute thanks and secret ecstasy awake voice of sweet song awake my heart awake green vales and icy cliffs all join my hymn thou first and chief sole sovereign of the vale o struggling with the darkness all the night and visited all night by troops of stars or when they climb the sky or when they sink companion of the morning-star at dawn thyself earth 's rosy star and of the dawn co-herald wake o wake and utter praise who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth who filled thy countenance with rosy light who made thee parent of perpetual streams and you ye five wild torrents fiercely glad who called you forth from night and utter death from dark and icy caverns called you forth down those precipitous black jagg

wilt thou forgive that sin where i begun which was my sin though it were done before wilt thou forgive that sin through which i run and do run still though still i do deplore when thou hast done thou hast not done for i have more wilt thou forgive that sin which i have won others to sin and made my sin their door wilt thou forgive that sin which i did shun a year or two but wallow 'd in a score when thou hast done thou hast not done for i have more i have a sin of fear that when i have spun my last thread i shall perish on the shore but swear by thyself that at my death thy son shall shine as he shines now and heretofore and having done that thou hast done i fear no more
hear me o god a broken heart is my best part use still thy rod that i may prove therein thy love if thou hadst not been stern to me but left me free i had forgot myself and thee for sin 's so sweet as minds ill-bent rarely repent until they meet their punishment who more can crave than thou hast done that gav'st a son to free a slave first made of nought with all since bought sin death and hell his glorious name quite overcame yet i rebel and slight the same but i 'll come in before my loss me farther toss as sure to win under his cross
vicisti galilæe i have lived long enough having seen one thing that love hath an end goddess and maiden and queen be near me now and befriend thou art more than the day or the morrow the seasons that laugh or that weep for these give joy and sorrow but thou proserpina sleep sweet is the treading of wine and sweet the feet of the dove but a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love yea is not even apollo with hair and harpstring of gold a bitter god to follow a beautiful god to behold i am sick of singing the bays burn deep and chafe i am fain to rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain for the gods we know not of who give us our daily breath we know they are cruel as love or life and lovely as death o gods dethroned and deceased cast forth wiped out in a day from your wrath is the world released redeemed from your chains men say new gods are crowned in the city their flowers have broken your rods they are merciful clothed with pity the young compassionate gods but for me their new device is barren the days are bare things long past over suffice and men forgotten that were time and the gods are at strife ye dwell in the midst thereof draining a little life from the barren breasts of love i say to you cease take rest yea i say to you all be at peace till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease wilt thou yet take all galilean but these thou shalt not take the laurel the palms and the pæan the breasts of the nymphs in the brake breasts more soft than a dove 's that tremble with tenderer breath and all the wings of the loves and all the joy before death all the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre dropped and deep in the flowers with strings that flicker like fire more than these wilt thou give things fairer than all these things nay for a little we live and life hath mutable wings a little while and we die shall life not thrive as it may for no man under the sky lives twice outliving his day and grief is a grievous thing and a man hath enough of his tears why should he labour and bring fresh grief to blacken his years thou hast conquered o pale galilean the world has grown grey from thy breath we have drunken of things lethean and fed on the fullness of death laurel is green for a season and love is sweet for a day but love grows bitter with treason and laurel outlives not may sleep shall we sleep after all for the world is not sweet in the end for the old faiths loosen and fall the new years ruin and rend fate is a sea without shore and the soul is a rock that abides but her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides o lips that the live blood faints in the leavings of racks and rods o ghastly glories of saints dead limbs of gibbeted gods though all men abase them before you in spirit and all knees bend i kneel not neither adore you but standing look to the end all delicate days and pleasant all spirits and sorrows are cast far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past where beyond the extreme sea-wall and between the remote sea-gates waste water washes and tall ships founder and deep death waits where mighty with deepening sides clad about with the seas as with wings and impelled of invisible tides and fulfilled of unspeakable things white-eyed and poisonous-finned shark-toothed and serpentine-curled rolls under the whitening wind of the future the wave of the world the depths stand naked in sunder behind it the storms flee away in the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey in its sides is the north-wind bound and its salt is of all men 's tears with light of ruin and sound of changes and pulse of years with travail of day after day and with trouble of hour upon hour and bitter as blood is the spray and the crests are as fangs that devour and its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be and its noise as the noise in a dream and its depth as the roots of the sea and the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air and the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble and time is made bare will ye bridle the deep sea with reins will ye chasten the high sea with rods will ye take her to chain her with chains who is older than all ye gods all ye as a wind shall go by as a fire shall ye pass and be past ye are gods and behold ye shall die and the waves be upon you at last in the darkness of time in the deeps of the years in the changes of things ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps and the world shall forget you for kings though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod though these that were gods are dead and thou being dead art a god though before thee the throned cytherean be fallen and hidden her head yet thy kingdom shall pass galilean thy dead shall go down to thee dead of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around thou art throned where another was king where another was queen she is crowned yea once we had sight of another but now she is queen say these not as thine not as thine was our mother a blossom of flowering seas clothed round with the world 's desire as with raiment and fair as the foam and fleeter than kindled fire and a goddess and mother of rome for thine came pale and a maiden and sister to sorrow but ours her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers white rose of the rose-white water a silver splendour a flame bent down unto us that besought her and earth grew sweet with her name for thine came weeping a slave among slaves and rejected but she came flushed from the full-flushed wave and imperial her foot on the sea and the wonderful waters knew her the winds and the viewless ways and the roses grew rosier and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays ye are fallen our lords by what token we wise that ye should not fall ye were all so fair that are broken and one more fair than ye all but i turn to her still having seen she shall surely abide in the end goddess and maiden and queen be near me now and befriend o daughter of earth of my mother her crown and blossom of birth i am also i also thy brother i go as i came unto earth in the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven the night where thou art where the silence is more than all tunes where sleep overflows from the heart where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world and the red rose is white and the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night and the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of gods from afar grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star in the sweet low light of thy face under heavens untrod by the sun let my soul with their souls find place and forget what is done and undone thou art more than the gods who number the days of our temporal breath let these give labour and slumber but thou proserpina death therefore now at thy feet i abide for a season in silence i know i shall die as my fathers died and sleep as they sleep even so for the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span a little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man so long i endure no longer and laugh not again neither weep for there is no god found stronger than death and death is a sleep
i am—yet what i am none cares or knows my friends forsake me like a memory lost i am the self-consumer of my woes— they rise and vanish in oblivious host like shadows in love ’ s frenzied stifled throes and yet i am and live—like vapours tossed into the nothingness of scorn and noise into the living sea of waking dreams where there is neither sense of life or joys but the vast shipwreck of my life ’ s esteems even the dearest that i loved the best are strange—nay rather stranger than the rest i long for scenes where man hath never trod a place where woman never smiled or wept there to abide with my creator god and sleep as i in childhood sweetly slept untroubling and untroubled where i lie the grass below—above the vaulted sky

foil 'd by our fellow-men depress 'd outworn we leave the brutal world to take its way and patience in another life we say the world shall be thrust down and we up-borne and will not then the immortal armies scorn the world 's poor routed leavings or will they who fail 'd under the heat of this life 's day support the fervours of the heavenly morn no no the energy of life may be kept on after the grave but not begun and he who flagg 'd not in the earthly strife from strength to strength advancing—only he his soul well-knit and all his battles won mounts and that hardly to eternal life
that which we dare invoke to bless our dearest faith our ghastliest doubt he they one all within without the power in darkness whom we guess i found him not in world or sun or eagle 's wing or insect 's eye nor thro the questions men may try the petty cobwebs we have spun if e'er when faith had fall'n asleep i heard a voice `` believe no more '' and heard an ever-breaking shore that tumbled in the godless deep a warmth within the breast would melt the freezing reason 's colder part and like a man in wrath the heart stood up and answer 'd `` i have felt '' no like a child in doubt and fear but that blind clamour made me wise then was i as a child that cries but crying knows his father near and what i am beheld again what is and no man understands and out of darkness came the hands that reach thro nature moulding men
love is and was my lord and king and in his presence i attend to hear the tidings of my friend which every hour his couriers bring love is and was my king and lord and will be tho as yet i keep within his court on earth and sleep encompass 'd by his faithful guard and hear at times a sentinel who moves about from place to place and whispers to the worlds of space in the deep night that all is well
with trembling fingers did we weave the holly round the christmas hearth a rainy cloud possess 'd the earth and sadly fell our christmas-eve at our old pastimes in the hall we gambol 'd making vain pretence of gladness with an awful sense of one mute shadow watching all we paused the winds were in the beech we heard them sweep the winter land and in a circle hand-in-hand sat silent looking each at each then echo-like our voices rang we sung tho every eye was dim a merry song we sang with him last year impetuously we sang we ceased a gentler feeling crept upon us surely rest is meet `` they rest '' we said `` their sleep is sweet '' and silence follow 'd and we wept our voices took a higher range once more we sang `` they do not die nor lose their mortal sympathy nor change to us although they change '' rapt from the fickle and the frail with gather 'd power yet the same pierces the keen seraphic flame from orb to orb from veil to veil '' rise happy morn rise holy morn draw forth the cheerful day from night o father touch the east and light the light that shone when hope was born
how fares it with the happy dead for here the man is more and more but he forgets the days before god shut the doorways of his head the days have vanish 'd tone and tint and yet perhaps the hoarding sense gives out at times he knows not whence a little flash a mystic hint and in the long harmonious years if death so taste lethean springs may some dim touch of earthly things surprise thee ranging with thy peers if such a dreamy touch should fall o turn thee round resolve the doubt my guardian angel will speak out in that high place and tell thee all
oh yet we trust that somehow good will be the final end of ill to pangs of nature sins of will defects of doubt and taints of blood that nothing walks with aimless feet that not one life shall be destroy 'd or cast as rubbish to the void when god hath made the pile complete that not a worm is cloven in vain that not a moth with vain desire is shrivell 'd in a fruitless fire or but subserves another 's gain behold we know not anything i can but trust that good shall fall at last—far off—at last to all and every winter change to spring so runs my dream but what am i an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry
the wish that of the living whole no life may fail beyond the grave derives it not from what we have the likest god within the soul are god and nature then at strife that nature lends such evil dreams so careful of the type she seems so careless of the single life that i considering everywhere her secret meaning in her deeds and finding that of fifty seeds she often brings but one to bear i falter where i firmly trod and falling with my weight of cares upon the great world 's altar-stairs that slope thro darkness up to god i stretch lame hands of faith and grope and gather dust and chaff and call to what i feel is lord of all and faintly trust the larger hope
you say but with no touch of scorn sweet-hearted you whose light-blue eyes are tender over drowning flies you tell me doubt is devil-born i know not one indeed i knew in many a subtle question versed who touch 'd a jarring lyre at first but ever strove to make it true perplext in faith but pure in deeds at last he beat his music out there lives more faith in honest doubt believe me than in half the creeds he fought his doubts and gather 'd strength he would not make his judgment blind he faced the spectres of the mind and laid them thus he came at length to find a stronger faith his own and power was with him in the night which makes the darkness and the light and dwells not in the light alone but in the darkness and the cloud as over sinaï 's peaks of old while israel made their gods of gold altho the trumpet blew so loud

how strange it seems these hebrews in their graves close by the street of this fair seaport town silent beside the never-silent waves at rest in all this moving up and down the trees are white with dust that o'er their sleep wave their broad curtains in the south-wind 's breath while underneath these leafy tents they keep the long mysterious exodus of death and these sepulchral stones so old and brown that pave with level flags their burial-place seem like the tablets of the law thrown down and broken by moses at the mountain 's base the very names recorded here are strange of foreign accent and of different climes alvares and rivera interchange with abraham and jacob of old times `` blessed be god for he created death '' the mourners said `` and death is rest and peace '' then added in the certainty of faith `` and giveth life that nevermore shall cease '' closed are the portals of their synagogue no psalms of david now the silence break no rabbi reads the ancient decalogue in the grand dialect the prophets spake gone are the living but the dead remain and not neglected for a hand unseen scattering its bounty like a summer rain still keeps their graves and their remembrance green how came they here what burst of christian hate what persecution merciless and blind drove o'er the sea — that desert desolate — these ishmaels and hagars of mankind they lived in narrow streets and lanes obscure ghetto and judenstrass in mirk and mire taught in the school of patience to endure the life of anguish and the death of fire all their lives long with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs of exile and its fears the wasting famine of the heart they fed and slaked its thirst with marah of their tears anathema maranatha was the cry that rang from town to town from street to street at every gate the accursed mordecai was mocked and jeered and spurned by christian feet pride and humiliation hand in hand walked with them through the world where'er they went trampled and beaten were they as the sand and yet unshaken as the continent for in the background figures vague and vast of patriarchs and of prophets rose sublime and all the great traditions of the past they saw reflected in the coming time and thus forever with reverted look the mystic volume of the world they read spelling it backward like a hebrew book till life became a legend of the dead but ah what once has been shall be no more the groaning earth in travail and in pain brings forth its races but does not restore and the dead nations never rise again
“ turn back ” was all she snapped out as she passed in a red dress that caught sunrays through mist i saw her lurch upwind kick off spiked heels climb out to the edge of a knife-sharp rockpile and arms outstretched lead the sea ’ s tympani lure the din guiding the steamy waves to shore will the almighty answer me she sang out to the ocean ’ s rising octaves as blown palms pointed scarflike fronds to land earlier that sunday she had prayed to a black christ in a church on the island droned verses for a safe calm and trekked homeward to board white louvered windows for the storm she had refused the chapel ’ s sanctuary to ask the ocean why the wind ripped homes and would again her anger captured me and stayed when i saw rain gleam on red ginger drench trumpets islanders call yellow-bells and soak ixora bonelike bits of shells and conchs lay on the beach as on an altar silent i watched her under a blank sky where waves broke over coral in thick haze pitched forward to hear the whirlwind ’ s reply she shook a fist then opened hands in praise
who says that fictions only and false hair become a verse is there in truth no beauty is all good structure in a winding stair may no lines pass except they do their duty not to a true but painted chair is it no verse except enchanted groves and sudden arbours shadow coarse-spun lines must purling streams refresh a lover 's loves must all be veil 'd while he that reads divines catching the sense at two removes shepherds are honest people let them sing riddle who list for me and pull for prime i envy no man 's nightingale or spring nor let them punish me with loss of rhyme who plainly say my god my king
for i will consider my cat jeoffry for he is the servant of the living god duly and daily serving him for at the first glance of the glory of god in the east he worships in his way for this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness for then he leaps up to catch the musk which is the blessing of god upon his prayer for he rolls upon prank to work it in for having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself for this he performs in ten degrees for first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean for secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there for thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended for fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood for fifthly he washes himself for sixthly he rolls upon wash. for seventhly he fleas himself that he may not be interrupted upon the beat for eighthly he rubs himself against a post for ninthly he looks up for his instructions for tenthly he goes in quest of food for having consider 'd god and himself he will consider his neighbour for if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness for when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance for one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying for when his day 's work is done his business more properly begins for he keeps the lord 's watch in the night against the adversary for he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes for he counteracts the devil who is death by brisking about the life for in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him for he is of the tribe of tiger for the cherub cat is a term of the angel tiger for he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent which in goodness he suppresses for he will not do destruction if he is well-fed neither will he spit without provocation for he purrs in thankfulness when god tells him he 's a good cat for he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon for every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit for the lord commanded moses concerning the cats at the departure of the children of israel from egypt for every family had one cat at least in the bag for the english cats are the best in europe for he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped for the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of god to him exceedingly for he is the quickest to his mark of any creature for he is tenacious of his point for he is a mixture of gravity and waggery for he knows that god is his saviour for there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest for there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion for he is of the lord 's poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—poor jeoffry poor jeoffry the rat has bit thy throat for i bless the name of the lord jesus that jeoffry is better for the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat for his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music for he is docile and can learn certain things for he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation for he can fetch and carry which is patience in employment for he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive for he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command for he can jump from an eminence into his master 's bosom for he can catch the cork and toss it again for he is hated by the hypocrite and miser for the former is afraid of detection for the latter refuses the charge for he camels his back to bear the first notion of business for he is good to think on if a man would express himself neatly for he made a great figure in egypt for his signal services for he killed the ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land for his ears are so acute that they sting again for from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention for by stroking of him i have found out electricity for i perceived god 's light about him both wax and fire for the electrical fire is the spiritual substance which god sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast for god has blessed him in the variety of his movements for tho he can not fly he is an excellent clamberer for his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped for he can tread to all the measures upon the music for he can swim for life for he can creep

saint augustine well hast thou said that of our vices we can frame a ladder if we will but tread beneath our feet each deed of shame all common things each day 's events that with the hour begin and end our pleasures and our discontents are rounds by which we may ascend the low desire the base design that makes another 's virtues less the revel of the ruddy wine and all occasions of excess the longing for ignoble things the strife for triumph more than truth the hardening of the heart that brings irreverence for the dreams of youth all thoughts of ill all evil deeds that have their root in thoughts of ill whatever hinders or impedes the action of the nobler will — all these must first be trampled down beneath our feet if we would gain in the bright fields of fair renown the right of eminent domain we have not wings we can not soar but we have feet to scale and climb by slow degrees by more and more the cloudy summits of our time the mighty pyramids of stone that wedge-like cleave the desert airs when nearer seen and better known are but gigantic flights of stairs the distant mountains that uprear their solid bastions to the skies are crossed by pathways that appear as we to higher levels rise the heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight but they while their companions slept were toiling upward in the night standing on what too long we bore with shoulders bent and downcast eyes we may discern — unseen before — a path to higher destinies nor deem the irrevocable past as wholly wasted wholly vain if rising on its wrecks at last to something nobler we attain

it was a picture i had after the war a bombed english church i was too young to know the word english or war but i knew the picture the ruined city still seemed noble the cathedral with its roof blown off was not less godly the church was the same plus rain and sky birds flew in and out of the holes god ’ s fist made in the walls all our desire for love or children is treated like rags by the enemy i knew so much and sang anyway like a bird who will sing until it is brought down when they take away the trees the child picks up a stick and says this is a tree this the house and the family as we might through a door of what had been a house into the field of rubble walks a single lamb tilting its head curious unafraid hungry
a dreadful darkness closes in on my bewildered mind o let me suffer and not sin be tortured yet resigned through all this world of whelming mist still let me look to thee and give me courage to resist the tempter till he flee weary i am — o give me strength and leave me not to faint say thou wilt comfort me at legnth and pity my complaint i 've begged to serve thee heart and soul to sacrifice to thee no niggard portion but the whole of my identity i hoped amid the brave and strong my portioned task might lie to toil amid the labouring throng with purpose pure and high but thou hast fixed another part and thou hast fixed it well i said so with my bleeding heart when first the anguish fell for thou hast taken my delight and hope of life away and bid me watch the painful night and wait the weary day the hope and delight were thine i bless thee for their loan i gave thee while i deemed them mine too little thanks i own shall i with joy thy blessings share and not endure their loss or hope the martyr 's crown to wear and cast away the cross these weary hours will not be lost these days of passive misery these nights of darkness anguish tost if i can fix my heart on thee weak and weary though i lie crushed with sorrow worn with pain still i may lift to heaven mine eye and strive and labour not in vain that inward strife against the sins that ever wait on suffering to watch and strike where first begins each ill that would corruption bring that secret labour to sustain with humble patience every blow to gather fortitude from pain and hope and holiness from woe thus let me serve thee from my heart whatever be my written fate whether thus early to depart or yet a while to wait if thou shouldst bring me back to life more humbled i should be more wise more strengthened for the strife more apt to lean on thee should death be standing at the gate thus should i keep my vow but lord whate'er my future fate so let me serve thee now
we wanted to confess our sins but there were no takers —milosz and the few willing to listen demanded that we confess on television so we kept our sins to ourselves and they became less troubling the halt and the lame arranged to have their hips replaced lepers coated their sores with a neutral foundation avoided strong light the hungry ate at grand buffets and grew huge though they remained hungry prisoners became indistinguishable from the few who visited them widows remarried and became strangers to their kin the orphans finally grew up and learned to fend for themselves even the prophets suspected they were mad and kept their mouths shut only the poor—who are with us always—only they continued in the hope

speck wherein the pained blood falters and goes out soft and stung softly — fairer for a fleck but though my lips shut sucking on the place there is no vein at work upon her face her eyelids are so peaceable no doubt deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways lo this is she that was the world 's delight the old grey years were parcels of her might the strewings of the ways wherein she trod were the twain seasons of the day and night lo she was thus when her clear limbs enticed all lips that now grow sad with kissing christ stained with blood fallen from the feet of god the feet and hands whereat our souls were priced alas lord surely thou art great and fair but lo her wonderfully woven hair and thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss but see now lord her mouth is lovelier she is right fair what hath she done to thee nay fair lord christ lift up thine eyes and see had now thy mother such a lip — like this thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me inside the horsel here the air is hot right little peace one hath for it god wot the scented dusty daylight burns the air and my heart chokes me till i hear it not behold my venus my soul 's body lies with my love laid upon her garment-wise feeling my love in all her limbs and hair and shed between her eyelids through her eyes she holds my heart in her sweet open hands hanging asleep hard by her head there stands crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire love wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands — hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume that shift and steam — loose clots of arid fume from the sea 's panting mouth of dry desire there stands he like one labouring at a loom the warp holds fast across and every thread that makes the woof up has dry specks of red always the shuttle cleaves clean through and he weaves with the hair of many a ruined head love is not glad nor sorry as i deem labouring he dreams and labours in the dream till when the spool is finished lo i see his web reeled off curls and goes out like steam night falls like fire the heavy lights run low and as they drop my blood and body so shake as the flame shakes full of days and hours that sleep not neither weep they as they go ah yet would god this flesh of mine might be where air might wash and long leaves cover me where tides of grass break into foam of flowers or where the wind 's feet shine along the sea ah yet would god that stems and roots were bred out of my weary body and my head that sleep were sealed upon me with a seal and i were as the least of all his dead would god my blood were dew to feed the grass mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass my body broken as a turning wheel and my mouth stricken ere it saith alas ah god that love were as a flower or flame that life were as the naming of a name that death were not more pitiful than desire that these things were not one thing and the same behold now surely somewhere there is death for each man hath some space of years he saith a little space of time ere time expire a little day a little way of breath and lo between the sundawn and the sun his day 's work and his night 's work are undone and lo between the nightfall and the light he is not and none knoweth of such an one ah god that i were as all souls that be as any herb or leaf of any tree as men that toil through hours of labouring night as bones of men under the deep sharp sea outside it must be winter among men for at the gold bars of the gates again i heard all night and all the hours of it the wind 's wet wings and fingers drip with rain knights gather riding sharp for cold i know the ways and woods are strangled with the snow and with short song the maidens spin and sit until christ 's birthnight lily-like arow the scent and shadow shed about me make the very soul in all my senses ache the hot hard night is fed upon my breath and sleep beholds me from afar awake alas but surely where the hills grow deep or where the wild ways of the sea are steep or in strange places somewhere there is death and on death 's face the scattered hair of sleep there lover-like with lips and limbs that meet they lie they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat but me the hot and hungry days devour and in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet no fruit of theirs but fruit of my desire for her love 's sake whose lips through mine respire her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire so lie we not as sleep that lies by death with heavy kisses and with happy breath not as man lies by woman when the bride laughs low for love 's sake and the words he saith for she lies laughing low with love she lies and turns his kisses on her lips to sighs to sighing sound of lips unsatisfied and the sweet tears are tender with her eyes ah not as they but as the souls that were slain in the old time having found her fair who sleeping with her lips upon their eyes heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair their blood runs round the roots of time like rain she casts them forth and gathers them again with nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain her little chambers drip with flower-like red her girdles and the chaplets of her head her armlets and her anklets with her feet she tramples all that winepress of the dead her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires with loves burnt out and unassuaged desires between her lips the steam of them is sweet the languor in her ears of many lyres her beds are full of perfume and sad sound her doors are made with music and barred round with sighing and with laughter and with tears with tears whereby strong souls of men are bound there is the knight adonis that was slain with flesh and blood she chains him for a chain the body and the spirit in her ears cry for her lips divide him vein by vein yea all she slayeth yea every man save me me love thy lover that must cleave to thee till the ending of the days and ways of earth the shaking of the sources of the sea me most forsaken of all souls that fell me satiated with things insatiable me for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth yea laughter kindles at the heart of hell alas thy beauty for thy mouth 's sweet sake my soul is bitter to me my limbs quake as water as the flesh of men that weep as their heart 's vein whose heart goes nigh to break ah god that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips would crush the fruit of death upon my lips ah god that death would tread the grapes of sleep and wring their juice upon me as it drips there is no change of cheer for many days but change of chimes high up in the air that sways rung by the running fingers of the wind and singing sorrows heard on hidden ways day smiteth day in twain night sundereth night and on mine eyes the dark sits as the light yea lord thou knowest i know not having sinned if heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight yea as if earth were sprinkled over me such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea each pore doth yearn and the dried blood thereof gasps by sick fits my heart swims heavily there is a feverish famine in my veins below her bosom where a crushed grape stains the white and blue there my lips caught and clove an hour since and what mark of me remains i dare not always touch her lest the kiss leave my lips charred yea lord a little bliss brief bitter bliss one hath for a great sin nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is sin is it sin whereby men 's souls are thrust into the pit yet had i a good trust to save my soul before it slipped therein trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust for if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath i look between the iron sides of death into sad hell where all sweet love hath end all but the pain that never finisheth there are the naked faces of great kings the singing folk with all their lute-playings there when one cometh he shall have to friend the grave that covets and the worm that clings there sit the knights that were so great of hand the ladies that were queens of fair green land grown grey and black now brought unto the dust soiled without raiment clad about with sand there is one end for all of them they sit naked and sad they drink the dregs of it trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust trampled and trodden by the fiery feet i see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell cities and people whom the gods loved well yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold and for their sakes on her the fire of hell and softer than the egyptian lote-leaf is the queen whose face was worth the world to kiss wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold and large pale lips of strong semiramis curled like a tiger 's that curl back to feed red only where the last kiss made them bleed her hair most thick with many a carven gem deep in the mane great-chested like a steed yea with red sin the faces of them shine but in all these there was no sin like mine no not in all the strange great sins of them that made the wine-press froth and foam with wine for i was of christ 's choosing i god 's knight no blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light i can well see for all the dusty days gone past the clean great time of goodly fight i smell the breathing battle sharp with blows with shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows the fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways sounds and long lights are shed between the rows of beautiful mailed men the edged light slips most like a snake that takes short breath and dips sharp from the beautifully bending head with all its gracious body lithe as lips that curl in touching you right in this wise my sword doth seeming fire in mine own eyes leaving all colours in them brown and red and flecked with death then the keen breaths like sighs the caught-up choked dry laughters following them when all the fighting face is grown a flame for pleasure and the pulse that stuns the ears and the heart 's gladness of the goodly game let me think yet a little i do know these things were sweet but sweet such years ago their savour is all turned now into tears yea ten years since where the blue ripples blow the blue curled eddies of the blowing rhine i felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine touch my blood too and sting me with delight through all this waste and weary body of mine that never feels clear air right gladly then i rode alone a great way off my men and heard the chiming bridle smite and smite and gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again till my song shifted to that iron one seeing there rode up between me and the sun some certain of my foe 's men for his three white wolves across their painted coats did run the first red-bearded with square cheeks — alack i made my knave 's blood turn his beard to black the slaying of him was a joy to see perchance too when at night he came not back some woman fell a-weeping whom this thief would beat when he had drunken yet small grief hath any for the ridding of such knaves yea if one wept i doubt her teen was brief this bitter love is sorrow in all lands draining of eyelids wringing of drenched hands sighing of hearts and filling up of graves a sign across the head of the world he stands an one that hath a plague-mark on his brows dust and spilt blood do track him to his house down under earth sweet smells of lip and cheek like a sweet snake 's breath made more poisonous with chewing of some perfumed deadly grass are shed all round his passage if he pass and their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was as one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds and tracking ever slotwise the warm smell is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds his head far down the hot sweet throat of her — so one tracks love whose breath is deadlier and lo one springe and you are fast in hell fast as the gin 's grip of a wayfarer i think now as the heavy hours decease one after one and bitter thoughts increase one upon one of all sweet finished things the breaking of the battle the long peace wherein we sat clothed softly each man 's hair crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair the sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings and noise of singing in the late sweet air i sang of love too knowing nought thereof '' sweeter '' i said `` the little laugh of love than tears out of the eyes of magdalen or any fallen feather of the dove `` the broken little laugh that spoils a kiss the ache of purple pulses and the bliss of blinded eyelids that expand again — love draws them open with those lips of his '' lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown of one same fire and colour with their own then ere one sleep appeased with sacrifice where his lips wounded there his lips atone '' i sang these things long since and knew them not '' lo here is love or there is love god wot this man and that finds favour in his eyes '' i said `` but i what guerdon have i got `` the dust of praise that is blown everywhere in all men 's faces with the common air the bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet before they wind it in a singer 's hair '' so that one dawn i rode forth sorrowing i had no hope but of some evil thing and so rode slowly past the windy wheat and past the vineyard and the water-spring up to the horsel a great elder-tree held back its heaps of flowers to let me see the ripe tall grass and one that walked therein naked with hair shed over to the knee she walked between the blossom and the grass i knew the beauty of her what she was the beauty of her body and her sin and in my flesh the sin of hers alas alas for sorrow is all the end of this o sad kissed mouth how sorrowful it is o breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings red with the bitter blossom of a kiss ah with blind lips i felt for you and found about my neck your hands and hair enwound the hands that stifle and the hair that stings i felt them fasten sharply without sound yea for my sin i had great store of bliss rise up make answer for me let thy kiss seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is yet i waxed faint with fume of barren bowers and murmuring of the heavy-headed hours and let the dove 's beak fret and peck within my lips in vain and love shed fruitless flowers so that god looked upon me when your hands were hot about me yea god brake my bands to save my soul alive and i came forth like a man blind and naked in strange lands that hears men laugh and weep and knows not whence nor wherefore but is broken in his sense howbeit i met folk riding from the north towards rome to purge them of their souls offence and rode with them and spake to none the day stunned me like lights upon some wizard way and ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight so rode i hearing all these chant and pray and marvelled till before us rose and fell white cursed hills like outer skirts of hell seen where men 's eyes look through the day to night like a jagged shell 's lips harsh untunable blown in between by devils wrangling breath nathless we won well past that hell and death down to the sweet land where all airs are good even unto rome where god 's grace tarrieth then came each man and worshipped at his knees who in the lord god 's likeness bears the keys to bind or loose and called on christ 's shed blood and so the sweet-souled father gave him ease but when i came i fell down at his feet saying `` father though the lord 's blood be right sweet the spot it takes not off the panther 's skin nor shall an ethiop 's stain be bleached with it `` lo i have sinned and have spat out at god wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod more sharp because of mine exceeding sin and all his raiment redder than bright blood '' before mine eyes yea for my sake i wot the heat of hell is waxen seven times hot through my great sin '' then spake he some sweet word giving me cheer which thing availed me not yea scarce i wist if such indeed were said for when i ceased — lo as one newly dead who hears a great cry out of hell i heard the crying of his voice across my head `` until this dry shred staff that hath no whit of leaf nor bark bear blossom and smell sweet seek thou not any mercy in god 's sight for so long shalt thou be cast out from it '' yea what if dried-up stems wax red and green shall that thing be which is not nor has been yea what if sapless bark wax green and white shall any good fruit grow upon my sin nay though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree and though men drew sweet waters of the sea there should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem this waste wan body and shaken soul of me yea though god search it warily enough there is not one sound thing in all thereof though he search all my veins through searching them he shall find nothing whole therein but love for i came home right heavy with small cheer and lo my love mine own soul 's heart more dear than mine own soul more beautiful than god who hath my being between the hands of her — fair still but fair for no man saving me as when she came out of the naked sea making the foam as fire whereon she trod and as the inner flower of fire was she yea she laid hold upon me and her mouth clove unto mine as soul to body doth and laughing made her lips luxurious her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south strange spice and flower strange savour of crushed fruit and perfume the swart kings tread underfoot for pleasure when their minds wax amorous charred frankincense and grated sandal-root and i forgot fear and all weary things all ended prayers and perished thanksgivings feeling her face with all her eager hair cleave to me clinging as a fire that clings to the body and to the raiment burning them as after death i know that such-like flame shall cleave to me for ever yea what care albeit i burn then having felt the same ah love there is no better life than this to have known love how bitter a thing it is and afterward be cast out of god 's sight yea these that know not shall they have such bliss high up in barren heaven before his face as we twain in the heavy-hearted place remembering love and all the dead delight and all that time was sweet with for a space for till the thunder in the trumpet be soul may divide from body but not we one from another i hold thee with my hand i let mine eyes have all their will of thee i seal myself upon thee with my might abiding alway out of all men 's sight until god loosen over sea and land the thunder of the trumpets of the night

night ’ s afterbirth last dream before waking holding on with dissolving hands out of it came not a line of old men but pairs of headlights delaying morning it felt like tears like wetted bedsheets and suspended in it like a medicine in vapor was the ocean ’ s presence ghost of deep water and the bite of salt here you found your body again the hand before your face and the face it touched eyes floating feet on invisible ground vagueness like another skin sent out into it anyway because it was morning to taste it touch blind hardness like marble ruins and skirt the edges razors in goosedown hydrants ’ fists abruptly out of it waves appeared transmuted from hanging silver ore crafted before the eyes into curving metals that broke into soup scum queen anne ’ s lace out of a great nothing a theology out of the amorphous an edgeless body or one like a hunting mass of tendrils that hurried down the sand moved by hunger i remember a gang of friends racing a fog bank ’ s onslaught along the beach seal-slick warm from the sun this thing would eat they ran laughing the fog came on and they were beautiful the three boys and one girl still in her wetsuit and the dissolution overtaking them their stridency full of faith still audible all morning bathed in a dovelike brooding the fog satisfied itself by overwhelming the meagre dew watering the doors 0f snails the leeward mold and held still and then near noon there was a concentration as if the sky tried to find a slippery word or remember—that ’ s right—remember where it was in an unfamiliar bedroom and knew and switched the light on wide awake
when i was young exorcisms were quite common a remedy not unlike ice baths plus devils were shorter in those days just as people were they had n't eaten enough fruits or vegetables and lacked essential vitamins and iron grew thin and pale fell easily into brooding depressions they looked more like deer than sheep and when they possessed you it was usually because they were fleeing from someone else and did n't realize where they were until it was too late it was more a question of giving directions than driving them out `` turn right at the hairdresser 's go straight until you get to the abandoned schoolhouse then turn left you should see the exit from there '' `` thank you i was completely lost '' `` you 're welcome good luck '' `` you too and thanks again ''
what i envy in the open eyes of the dead deer hanging down from the rafters its eyes still wet and glassy but locked now into a vision of another life is the way it seems to be staring at the moment when it died the blue light falling through the window into this smoke-filled room is the same color as the mist coming down off the mountain that morning the deer sees men with guns but also sees beyond them the endless mountains
ice entire cakes of it crows feed on sand so poor is this season the ground steals color from the tree-shadows • can it be that nothing is as far as here just look how much past we have to cover this evening– • come to think of it do n't forget to pick off this self and that self along the way though that ’ s not right– you spit them out like pits • if there is a partition between the outer and inner worlds how is it that some water in me churns between the mountain ranges how is it we are absorbed so easily by the ground— • long nights for simple words • slant rhyme of current thinking and past thinking a chewed over hour late where the long ago past and the future come to settle scores • traveling and traveling but so much interior unpicked over by the eyes • nothing is as far as here
now as at all times i can see in the mind 's eye in their stiff painted clothes the pale unsatisfied ones appear and disappear in the blue depths of the sky with all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones and all their helms of silver hovering side by side and all their eyes still fixed hoping to find once more being by calvary 's turbulence unsatisfied the uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor

under the level winter sky i saw a thousand christs go by they sang an idle song and free as they went up to calvary careless of eye and coarse of lip they marched in holiest fellowship that heaven might heal the world they gave their earth-born dreams to deck the grave with souls unpurged and steadfast breath they supped the sacrament of death and for each one far off apart seven swords have rent a woman 's heart
this is that blessed mary pre-elect god 's virgin gone is a great while and she dwelt young in nazareth of galilee unto god 's will she brought devout respect profound simplicity of intellect and supreme patience from her mother 's knee faithful and hopeful wise in charity strong in grave peace in pity circumspect so held she through her girlhood as it were an angel-water 'd lily that near god grows and is quiet till one dawn at home she woke in her white bed and had no fear at all —yet wept till sunshine and felt aw 'd because the fulness of the time was come
i found me in a great surging space at either end a door and i said `` what is this giddying place with no firm-fixéd floor that i knew not of before '' `` it is life '' said a mask-clad face i asked `` but how do i come here who never wished to come can the light and air be made more clear the floor more quietsome and the doors set wide they numb fast-locked and fill with fear '' the mask put on a bleak smile then and said `` o vassal-wight there once complained a goosequill pen to the scribe of the infinite of the words it had to write because they were past its ken ''

i haled me a woman from the street shameless but oh so fair i bade her sit in the model ’ s seat and i painted her sitting there i hid all trace of her heart unclean i painted a babe at her breast i painted her as she might have been if the worst had been the best she laughed at my picture and went away then came with a knowing nod a connoisseur and i heard him say “ ’ tis mary the mother of god. ” so i painted a halo round her hair and i sold her and took my fee and she hangs in the church of saint hillaire where you and all may see
shoes secret face of my inner life two gaping toothless mouths two partly decomposed animal skins smelling of mice nests my brother and sister who died at birth continuing their existence in you guiding my life toward their incomprehensible innocence what use are books to me when in you it is possible to read the gospel of my life on earth and still beyond of things to come i want to proclaim the religion i have devised for your perfect humility and the strange church i am building with you as the altar ascetic and maternal you endure kin to oxen to saints to condemned men with your mute patience forming the only true likeness of myself
she fell asleep on christmas eve at length the long-ungranted shade of weary eyelids overweigh'd the pain nought else might yet relieve our mother who had lean 'd all day over the bed from chime to chime then rais 'd herself for the first time and as she sat her down did pray her little work-table was spread with work to finish for the glare made by her candle she had care to work some distance from the bed without there was a cold moon up of winter radiance sheer and thin the hollow halo it was in was like an icy crystal cup through the small room with subtle sound of flame by vents the fireshine drove and redden 'd in its dim alcove the mirror shed a clearness round i had been sitting up some nights and my tired mind felt weak and blank like a sharp strengthening wine it drank the stillness and the broken lights twelve struck that sound by dwindling years heard in each hour crept off and then the ruffled silence spread again like water that a pebble stirs our mother rose from where she sat her needles as she laid them down met lightly and her silken gown settled no other noise than that `` glory unto the newly born '' so as said angels she did say because we were in christmas day though it would still be long till morn just then in the room over us there was a pushing back of chairs as some who had sat unawares so late now heard the hour and rose with anxious softly-stepping haste our mother went where margaret lay fearing the sounds o'erhead—should they have broken her long watch'd-for rest she stoop 'd an instant calm and turn 'd but suddenly turn 'd back again and all her features seem 'd in pain with woe and her eyes gaz 'd and yearn 'd for my part i but hid my face and held my breath and spoke no word there was none spoken but i heard the silence for a little space our mother bow 'd herself and wept and both my arms fell and i said '' god knows i knew that she was dead '' and there all white my sister slept then kneeling upon christmas morn a little after twelve o'clock we said ere the first quarter struck '' christ 's blessing on the newly born ''
in the flame of the flickering fire the sins of my soul are few and the thoughts in my head are the thoughts of a bed with a solitary view but the eye of eternal consciousness must blink as a bat blinks bright or ever the thoughts in my head be stilled on the brink of eternal night oh feed to the golden fish his egg where he floats in his captive bowl to the cat his kind from the womb born blind and to the lord my soul
`` not by the justice that my father spurn 'd not for the thousands whom my father slew altars unfed and temples overturn 'd cold hearts and thankless tongues where thanks are due fell this dread voice from lips that can not lie stern sentence of the powers of destiny `` i will unfold my sentence and my crime my crime—that rapt in reverential awe i sate obedient in the fiery prime of youth self-govern 'd at the feet of law ennobling this dull pomp the life of kings by contemplation of diviner things `` my father loved injustice and lived long crown 'd with grey hairs he died and full of sway i loved the good he scorn 'd and hated wrong— the gods declare my recompense to-day i look 'd for life more lasting rule more high and when six years are measured lo i die `` yet surely o my people did i deem man 's justice from the all-just gods was given a light that from some upper fount did beam some better archetype whose seat was heaven a light that shining from the blest abodes did shadow somewhat of the life of gods `` mere phantoms of man 's self-tormenting heart which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed vain dreams which quench our pleasures then depart when the duped soul self-master 'd claims its meed when on the strenuous just man heaven bestows crown of his struggling life an unjust close `` seems it so light a thing then austere powers to spurn man 's common lure life 's pleasant things seems there no joy in dances crown 'd with flowers love free to range and regal banquetings bend ye on these indeed an unmoved eye not gods but ghosts in frozen apathy `` or is it that some force too wise too strong even for yourselves to conquer or beguile sweeps earth and heaven and men and gods along like the broad volume of the insurgent nile and the great powers we serve themselves may be slaves of a tyrannous necessity `` or in mid-heaven perhaps your golden cars where earthly voice climbs never wing their flight and in wild hunt through mazy tracts of stars sweep in the sounding stillness of the night or in deaf ease on thrones of dazzling sheen drinking deep draughts of joy ye dwell serene `` oh wherefore cheat our youth if thus it be of one short joy one lust one pleasant dream stringing vain words of powers we can not see blind divinations of a will supreme lost labour when the circumambient gloom but hides if gods gods careless of our doom `` the rest i give to joy even while i speak my sand runs short and—as yon star-shot ray hemm 'd by two banks of cloud peers pale and weak now as the barrier closes dies away— even so do past and future intertwine blotting this six years space which yet is mine `` six years—six little years—six drops of time yet suns shall rise and many moons shall wane and old men die and young men pass their prime and languid pleasure fade and flower again and the dull gods behold ere these are flown revels more deep joy keener than their own `` into the silence of the groves and woods i will go forth though something would i say— something—yet what i know not for the gods the doom they pass revoke not nor delay and prayers and gifts and tears are fruitless all and the night waxes and the shadows fall `` ye men of egypt ye have heard your king i go and i return not but the will of the great gods is plain and ye must bring ill deeds ill passions zealous to fulfil their pleasure to their feet and reap their praise the praise of gods rich boon and length of days '' —so spake he half in anger half in scorn and one loud cry of grief and of amaze broke from his sorrowing people so he spake and turning left them there and with brief pause girt with a throng of revellers bent his way to the cool region of the groves he loved there by the river-banks he wander 'd on from palm-grove on to palm-grove happy trees their smooth tops shining sunward and beneath burying their unsunn 'd stems in grass and flowers where in one dream the feverish time of youth might fade in slumber and the feet of joy might wander all day long and never tire here came the king holding high feast at morn rose-crown 'd and ever when the sun went down a hundred lamps beam 'd in the tranquil gloom from tree to tree all through the twinkling grove revealing all the tumult of the feast— flush 'd guests and golden goblets foam 'd with wine while the deep-burnish 'd foliage overhead splinter 'd the silver arrows of the moon it may be that sometimes his wondering soul from the loud joyful laughter of his lips might shrink half startled like a guilty man who wrestles with his dream as some pale shape gliding half hidden through the dusky stems would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl whispering a little space and thou art mine it may be on that joyless feast his eye dwelt with mere outward seeming he within took measure of his soul and knew its strength and by that silent knowledge day by day was calm 'd ennobled comforted sustain 'd it may be but not less his brow was smooth and his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom and his mirth quail 'd not at the mild reproof sigh 'd out by winter 's sad tranquillity nor pall 'd with its own fulness ebb 'd and died in the rich languor of long summer-days nor wither 'd when the palm-tree plumes that roof'd with their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring no nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds so six long years he revell 'd night and day and when the mirth wax 'd loudest with dull sound sometimes from the grove 's centre echoes came to tell his wondering people of their king in the still night across the steaming flats mix 'd with the murmur of the moving nile

of fresh-cut grass invite to rest the traveller there before he climb the pass— the gentian-flower 'd pass its crown with yellow spires aflame whence drops the path to allière down and walls where byron came by their green river who doth change his birth-name just below orchard and croft and full-stored grange nursed by his pastoral flow but stop —to fetch back thoughts that stray beyond this gracious bound the cone of jaman pale and gray see in the blue profound ah jaman delicately tall above his sun-warm 'd firs— what thoughts to me his rocks recall what memories he stirs and who but thou must be in truth obermann with me here thou master of my wandering youth but left this many a year yes i forget the world 's work wrought its warfare waged with pain an eremite with thee in thought once more i slip my chain and to thy mountain-chalet come and lie beside its door and hear the wild bee 's alpine hum and thy sad tranquil lore again i feel the words inspire their mournful calm serene yet tinged with infinite desire for all that might have been— the harmony from which man swerved made his life 's rule once more the universal order served earth happier than before —while thus i mused night gently ran down over hill and wood then still and sudden obermann on the grass near me stood those pensive features well i knew on my mind years before imaged so oft imaged so true —a shepherd 's garb he wore a mountain-flower was in his hand a book was in his breast bent on my face with gaze which scann'd my soul his eyes did rest `` and is it thou '' he cried `` so long held by the world which we loved not who turnest from the throng back to thy youth and me `` and from thy world with heart opprest choosest thou now to turn — ah me we anchorites read things best clearest their course discern `` thou fledst me when the ungenial earth man 's work-place lay in gloom return'st thou in her hour of birth of hopes and hearts in bloom `` perceiv'st thou not the change of day ah carry back thy ken what some two thousand years survey the world as it was then `` like ours it look 'd in outward air its head was clear and true sumptuous its clothing rich its fare no pause its action knew '' stout was its arm each thew and bone seem 'd puissant and alive— but ah its heart its heart was stone and so it could not thrive `` on that hard pagan world disgust and secret loathing fell deep weariness and sated lust made human life a hell `` in his cool hall with haggard eyes the roman noble lay he drove abroad in furious guise along the appian way `` he made a feast drank fierce and fast and crown 'd his hair with flowers— no easier nor no quicker pass'd the impracticable hours `` the brooding east with awe beheld her impious younger world the roman tempest swell 'd and swell 'd and on her head was hurl 'd `` the east bow 'd low before the blast in patient deep disdain she let the legions thunder past and plunged in thought again `` so well she mused a morning broke across her spirit grey a conquering new-born joy awoke and fill 'd her life with day `` 'poor world she cried 'so deep accurst that runn'st from pole to pole to seek a draught to slake thy thirst— go seek it in thy soul `` she heard it the victorious west in crown and sword array 'd she felt the void which mined her breast she shiver 'd and obey 'd `` she veil 'd her eagles snapp 'd her sword and laid her sceptre down her stately purple she abhorr 'd and her imperial crown `` she broke her flutes she stopp 'd her sports her artists could not please she tore her books she shut her courts she fled her palaces '' lust of the eye and pride of life she left it all behind and hurried torn with inward strife the wilderness to find `` tears wash 'd the trouble from her face she changed into a child 'mid weeds and wrecks she stood—a place of ruin—but she smiled `` oh had i lived in that great day how had its glory new fill 'd earth and heaven and caught away my ravish 'd spirit too `` no thoughts that to the world belong had stood against the wave of love which set so deep and strong from christ 's then open grave `` no cloister-floor of humid stone had been too cold for me for me no eastern desert lone had been too far to flee `` no lonely life had pass 'd too slow when i could hourly scan upon his cross with head sunk low that nail 'd thorn-crowned man `` could see the mother with her child whose tender winning arts have to his little arms beguiled so many wounded hearts `` and centuries came and ran their course and unspent all that time still still went forth that child 's dear force and still was at its prime `` ay ages long endured his span of life—'tis true received— that gracious child that thorn-crown 'd man —he lived while we believed `` while we believed on earth he went and open stood his grave men call 'd from chamber church and tent and christ was by to save `` now he is dead far hence he lies in the lorn syrian town and on his grave with shining eyes the syrian stars look down `` in vain men still with hoping new regard his death-place dumb and say the stone is not yet to and wait for words to come `` ah o'er that silent sacred land of sun and arid stone and crumbling wall and sultry sand sounds now one word alone `` unduped of fancy henceforth man must labour —must resign his all too human creeds and scan simply the way divine `` but slow that tide of common thought which bathed our life retired slow slow the old world wore to nought and pulse by pulse expired `` its frame yet stood without a breach when blood and warmth were fled and still it spake its wonted speech— but every word was dead `` and oh we cried that on this corse might fall a freshening storm rive its dry bones and with new force a new-sprung world inform `` —down came the storm o'er france it pass'd in sheets of scathing fire all europe felt that fiery blast and shook as it rush 'd by her `` down came the storm in ruins fell the worn-out world we knew it pass 'd that elemental swell again appear 'd the blue '' the sun shone in the new-wash 'd sky and what from heaven saw he blocks of the past like icebergs high float on a rolling sea `` upon them plies the race of man all it before endeavour 'd 'ye live i cried 'ye work and plan and know not ye are sever 'd `` 'poor fragments of a broken world whereon men pitch their tent why were ye too to death not hurl'd when your world 's day was spent `` 'that glow of central fire is done which with its fusing flame knit all your parts and kept you one— but ye ye are the same `` 'the past its mask of union on had ceased to live and thrive the past its mask of union gone say is it more alive `` 'your creeds are dead your rites are dead your social order too where tarries he the power who said see i make all things new `` 'the millions suffer still and grieve and what can helpers heal with old-world cures men half believe for woes they wholly feel `` 'and yet men have such need of joy but joy whose grounds are true and joy that should all hearts employ as when the past was new `` 'ah not the emotion of that past its common hope were vain some new such hope must dawn at last or man must toss in pain `` 'but now the old is out of date the new is not yet born and who can be alone elate while the world lies forlorn `` then to the wilderness i fled.— there among alpine snows and pastoral huts i hid my head and sought and found repose `` it was not yet the appointed hour sad patient and resign 'd i watch 'd the crocus fade and flower i felt the sun and wind `` the day i lived in was not mine man gets no second day in dreams i saw the future shine— but ah i could not stay `` action i had not followers fame i pass 'd obscure alone the after-world forgets my name nor do i

pursued `` with hope extinct and brow composed i mark 'd the present die its term of life was nearly closed yet it had more than i `` but thou though to the world 's new hour thou come with aspect marr 'd shorn of the joy the bloom the power which best befits its bard— '' though more than half thy years be past and spent thy youthful prime though round thy firmer manhood cast hang weeds of our sad time '' whereof thy youth felt all the spell and traversed all the shade— though late though dimm 'd though weak yet tell hope to a world new-made `` help it to fill that deep desire the want which rack 'd our brain consumed our heart with thirst like fire immedicable pain '' which to the wilderness drove out our life to alpine snow and palsied all our word with doubt and all our work with woe— '' what still of strength is left employ that end to help attain one common wave of thought and joy lifting mankind again '' —the vision ended i awoke as out of sleep and no voice moved —only the torrent broke the silence far below soft darkness on the turf did lie solemn o'er hut and wood in the yet star-sown nightly sky the peak of jaman stood still in my soul the voice i heard of obermann —away i turn 'd by some vague impulse stirr 'd along the rocks of naye past sonchaud 's piny flanks i gaze and the blanch 'd summit bare of malatrait to where in haze the valais opens fair and the domed velan with his snows behind the upcrowding hills doth all the heavenly opening close which the rhone 's murmur fills— and glorious there without a sound across the glimmering lake high in the valais-depth profound i saw the morning break
i we thrill too strangely at the master 's touch we shrink too sadly from the larger self which for its own completeness agitates and undetermines us we do not feel— we dare not feel it yet—the splendid shame of uncreated failure we forget the while we groan that god 's accomplishment is always and unfailingly at hand ii tumultuously void of a clean scheme whereon to build whereof to formulate the legion life that riots in mankind goes ever plunging upward up and down most like some crazy regiment at arms undisciplined of aught but ignorance and ever led resourcelessly along to brainless carnage by drunk trumpeters iii to me the groaning of world-worshippers rings like a lonely music played in hell by one with art enough to cleave the walls of heaven with his cadence but without the wisdom or the will to comprehend the strangeness of his own perversity and all without the courage to deny the profit and the pride of his defeat iv while we are drilled in error we are lost alike to truth and usefulness we think we are great warriors now and we can brag like titans but the world is growing young and we the fools of time are growing with it — we do not fight to-day we only die we are too proud of death and too ashamed of god to know enough to be alive v there is one battle-field whereon we fall triumphant and unconquered but alas we are too fleshly fearful of ourselves to fight there till our days are whirled and blurred by sorrow and the ministering wheels of anguish take us eastward where the clouds of human gloom are lost against the gleam that shines on thought 's impenetrable mail vi when we shall hear no more the cradle-songs of ages—when the timeless hymns of love defeat them and outsound them—we shall know the rapture of that large release which all right science comprehends and we shall read with unoppressed and unoffended eyes that record of all-soul whereon god writes in everlasting runes the truth of him vii the guerdon of new childhood is repose — once he has read the primer of right thought a man may claim between two smithy strokes beatitude enough to realize god 's parallel completeness in the vague and incommensurable excellence that equitably uncreates itself and makes a whirlwind of the universe viii there is no loneliness —no matter where we go nor whence we come nor what good friends forsake us in the seeming we are all at one with a complete companionship and though forlornly joyless be the ways we travel the compensate spirit-gleams of wisdom shaft the darkness here and there like scattered lamps in unfrequented streets ix when one that you and i had all but sworn to be the purest thing god ever made bewilders us until at last it seems an angel has come back restigmatized — faith wavers and we wonder what there is on earth to make us faithful any more but never are quite wise enough to know the wisdom that is in that wonderment x where does a dead man go —the dead man dies but the free life that would no longer feed on fagots of outburned and shattered flesh wakes to a thrilled invisible advance unchained or fettered else of memory and when the dead man goes it seems to me 't were better for us all to do away with weeping and be glad that he is gone xi so through the dusk of dead blank-legended and unremunerative years we search to get where life begins and still we groan because we do not find the living spark where no spark ever was and thus we die still searching like poor old astronomers who totter off to bed and go to sleep to dream of untriangulated stars xii with conscious eyes not yet sincere enough to pierce the glimmered cloud that fluctuates between me and the glorifying light that screens itself with knowledge i discern the searching rays of wisdom that reach through the mist of shame 's infirm credulity and infinitely wonder if hard words like mine have any message for the dead xiii i grant you friendship is a royal thing but none shall ever know that royalty for what it is till he has realized his best friend in himself 't is then perforce that man 's unfettered faith indemnifies of its own conscious freedom the old shame and love 's revealed infinitude supplants of its own wealth and wisdom the old scorn xiv though the sick beast infect us we are fraught forever with indissoluble truth wherein redress reveals itself divine transitional transcendent grief and loss disease and desolation are the dreams of wasted excellence and every dream has in it something of an ageless fact that flouts deformity and laughs at years xv we lack the courage to be where we are — we love too much to travel on old roads to triumph on old fields we love too much to consecrate the magic of dead things and yieldingly to linger by long walls of ruin where the ruinous moonlight that sheds a lying glory on old stones befriends us with a wizard 's enmity xvi something as one with eyes that look below the battle-smoke to glimpse the foeman 's charge we through the dust of downward years may scan the onslaught that awaits this idiot world where blood pays blood for nothing and where life pays life to madness till at last the ports of gilded helplessness be battered through by the still crash of salvatory steel xvii to you that sit with sorrow like chained slaves and wonder if the night will ever come i would say this the night will never come and sorrow is not always but my words are not enough your eyes are not enough the soul itself must insulate the real or ever you do cherish in this life— in this life or in any life—repose xviii like a white wall whereon forever breaks unsatisfied the tumult of green seas man 's unconjectured godliness rebukes with its imperial silence the lost waves of insufficient grief this mortal surge that beats against us now is nothing else than plangent ignorance truth neither shakes nor wavers but the world shakes and we shriek xix nor jewelled phrase nor mere mellifluous rhyme reverberates aright or ever shall one cadence of that infinite plain-song which is itself all music stronger notes than any that have ever touched the world must ring to tell it—ring like hammer-blows right-echoed of a chime primordial on anvils in the gleaming of god 's forge xx the prophet of dead words defeats himself whoever would acknowledge and include the foregleam and the glory of the real must work with something else than pen and ink and painful preparation he must work with unseen implements that have no names and he must win withal to do that work good fortitude clean wisdom and strong skill xxi to curse the chilled insistence of the dawn because the free gleam lingers to defraud the constant opportunity that lives unchallenged in all sorrow to forget for this large prodigality of gold that larger generosity of thought — these are the fleshly clogs of human greed the fundamental blunders of mankind xxii forebodings are the fiends of recreance the master of the moment the clean seer of ages too securely scans what is ever to be appalled at what is not he sees beyond the groaning borough lines of hell god 's highways gleaming and he knows that love 's complete communion is the end of anguish to the liberated man xxiii here by the windy docks i stand alone but yet companioned there the vessel goes and there my friend goes with it but the wake that melts and ebbs between that

there 's little joy in life for me and little terror in the grave i 've lived the parting hour to see of one i would have died to save calmly to watch the failing breath wishing each sigh might be the last longing to see the shade of death o'er those belovèd features cast the cloud the stillness that must part the darling of my life from me and then to thank god from my heart to thank him well and fervently although i knew that we had lost the hope and glory of our life and now benighted tempest-tossed must bear alone the weary strife
1916 i i found a dreadful acre of the dead marked with the only sign on earth that saves the wings of death were hurrying overhead the loose earth shook on those unquiet graves for the deep gun-pits with quick stabs of flame made their own thunders of the sunlit air yet as i read the crosses name by name rank after rank it seemed that peace was there sunlight and peace a peace too deep for thought the peace of tides that underlie our strife the peace with which the moving heavens are fraught the peace that is our everlasting life the loose earth shook the very hills were stirred the silence of the dead was all i heard ii we who lie here have nothing more to pray to all your praises we are deaf and blind we may not ever know if you betray our hope to make earth better for mankind only our silence in the night shall grow more silent as the stars grow in the sky and while you deck our graves you shall not know how many scornful legions pass you by for we have heard you say when we were living that some small dream of good would “ cost too much. ” but when the foe struck we have watched you giving and seen you move the mountains with one touch what can be done we know but have no fear if you fail now we shall not see or hear

ere on my bed my limbs i lay it hath not been my use to pray with moving lips or bended knees but silently by slow degrees my spirit i to love compose in humble trust mine eye-lids close with reverential resignation no wish conceived no thought exprest only a sense of supplication a sense o'er all my soul imprest that i am weak yet not unblest since in me round me every where eternal strength and wisdom are but yester-night i prayed aloud in anguish and in agony up-starting from the fiendish crowd of shapes and thoughts that tortured me a lurid light a trampling throng sense of intolerable wrong and whom i scorned those only strong thirst of revenge the powerless will still baffled and yet burning still desire with loathing strangely mixed on wild or hateful objects fixed fantastic passions maddening brawl and shame and terror over all deeds to be hid which were not hid which all confused i could not know whether i suffered or i did for all seemed guilt remorse or woe my own or others still the same life-stifling fear soul-stifling shame so two nights passed the night 's dismay saddened and stunned the coming day sleep the wide blessing seemed to me distemper 's worst calamity the third night when my own loud scream had waked me from the fiendish dream o'ercome with sufferings strange and wild i wept as i had been a child and having thus by tears subdued my anguish to a milder mood such punishments i said were due to natures deepliest stained with sin — for aye entempesting anew the unfathomable hell within the horror of their deeds to view to know and loathe yet wish and do such griefs with such men well agree but wherefore wherefore fall on me to be loved is all i need and whom i love i love indeed

attending when that fatal wound shall be inflicted by the seed of eve upon my head long the decrees of heav'n delay for longest time to him is short and now too soon for us the circling hours this dreaded time have compast wherein we must bide the stroak of that long threatn 'd wound at least if so we can and by the head broken be not intended all our power to be infring 'd our freedom and our

youths full flowr displaying all vertue grace and wisdom to atchieve things highest greatest multiplies my fear before him a great prophet to proclaim his coming is sent harbinger who all invites and in the consecrated stream pretends to wash off sin and fit them so purified to receive him pure or rather to do him honour as their king all come and he himself among them was baptiz 'd not thence to be more pure but to receive the testimony of heaven that who he is thenceforth the nations may not doubt i saw the prophet do him reverence on him rising out of the water heav'n above the clouds unfold her crystal dores thence on his head a perfect dove descend what e 're it meant and out of heav'n the sov'raign voice i heard this is my son belov 'd in him am pleas 'd his mother then is mortal but his sire he who obtains the monarchy of heav'n and what will he not do to advance his son his first-begot we know and sore have felt when his fierce thunder drove us to the deep who this is we must learn for man he seems in all his lineaments though in his face the glimpses of his fathers glory shine ye see our danger on the utmost edge of hazard which admits no long debate but must with something sudden be oppos 'd not force but well couch't fraud well woven snares e 're in the head of nations he appear their king their leader and supream on earth i when no other durst sole undertook the dismal expedition to find out and ruine adam and the exploit perform'd successfully a calmer voyage now will waft me and the way found prosperous once induces best to hope of like success he ended and his words impression left of much amazement to th infernal crew distracted and surpriz 'd with deep dismay at these sad tidings but no time was then for long indulgence to their fears or grief unanimous they all commit the care and management of this main enterprize to him their great dictator whose attempt at first against mankind so well had thriv'd in adam 's overthrow and led thir march from hell 's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light regents and potentates and kings yea gods of many a pleasant realm and province wide so to the coast of jordan he directs his easie steps girded with snaky wiles where he might likeliest find this new-declar 'd this man of men attested son of god temptation and all guile on him to try so to subvert whom he suspected rais'd to end his raign on earth so long enjoy 'd but contrary unweeting he fulfill'd the purpos 'd counsel pre-ordain 'd and fixt of the most high who in full frequence bright of angels thus to gabriel smiling spake gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold thou and all angels conversant on earth with man or mens affairs how i begin to verifie that solemn message late on which i sent thee to the virgin pure in galilee that she should bear a son great in renown and call 'd the son of god then toldst her doubting how these things could be to her a virgin that on her should come the holy ghost and the power of the highest o're-shadow her this man born and now up-grown to shew him worthy of his birth divine and high prediction henceforth i expose to satan let him tempt and now assay his utmost subtilty because he boasts and vaunts of his great cunning to the throng of his apostasie he might have learnt less over-weening since he fail 'd in job whose constant perseverance overcame whate 're his cruel malice could invent he now shall know i can produce a man of female seed far abler to resist all his sollicitations and at length all his vast force and drive him back to hell winning by conquest what the first man lost by fallacy surpriz 'd but first i mean to exercise him in the wilderness there he shall first lay down the rudiments of his great warfare e 're i send him forth to conquer sin and death the two grand foes by humiliation and strong sufferance his weakness shall o'recome satanic strength and all the world and mass of sinful flesh that all the angels and ætherial powers they now and men hereafter may discern from what consummate vertue i have chose this perfect man by merit call 'd my son to earn salvation for the sons of men so spake the eternal father and all heaven admiring stood a space then into hymns burst forth and in celestial measures mov 'd circling the throne and singing while the hand sung with the voice and this the argument victory and triumph to the son of god now entring his great duel not of arms but to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles the father knows the son therefore secure ventures his filial vertue though untri 'd against whate 're may tempt whate 're seduce allure or terrifie or undermine be frustrate all ye stratagems of hell and devilish machinations come to nought so they in heav'n their odes and vigils tun 'd mean while the son of god who yet some days lodg 'd in bethabara where john baptiz 'd musing and much revolving in his brest how best the mighty work he might begin of saviour to mankind and which way first publish his god-like office now mature one day forth walk 'd alone the spirit leading and his deep thoughts the better to converse with solitude till far from track of men thought following thought and step by step led on he entred now the bordering desert wild and with dark shades and rocks environ 'd round his holy meditations thus persu 'd o what a multitude of thoughts at once awakn 'd in me swarm while i consider what from within i feel my self and hear what from without comes often to my ears ill sorting with my present state compar 'd when i was yet a child no childish play to me was pleasing all my mind was set serious to learn and know and thence to do what might be publick good my self i thought born to that end born to promote all truth all righteous things therefore above my years the law of god i read and found it sweet made it my whole delight and in it grew to such perfection that e 're yet my age had measur 'd twice six years at our great feast i went into the temple there to hear the teachers of our law and to propose what might improve my knowledge or their own and was admir 'd by all yet this not all to which my spirit aspir 'd victorious deeds flam 'd in my heart heroic acts one while to rescue israel from the roman yoke then to subdue and quell o 're all the earth brute violence and proud tyrannick pow'r till truth were freed and equity restor 'd yet held it more humane more heavenly first by winning words to conquer willing hearts and make perswasion do the work of fear at least to try and teach the erring soul not wilfully mis-doing but unware misled the stubborn only to destroy these growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving by words at times cast forth inly rejoyc 'd and said to me apart high are thy thoughts o son but nourish them and let them soar to what highth sacred vertue and true worth can raise them though above example high by matchless deeds express thy matchless sire for know thou art no son of mortal man though men esteem thee low of parentage thy father is the eternal king who rules all heaven and earth angels and sons of men a messenger from god fore-told thy birth conceiv 'd in me a virgin he fore-told thou shouldst be great and sit on david 's throne and of thy kingdom there should be no end at thy nativity a glorious quire of angels in the fields of bethlehem sung to shepherds watching at their folds by night and told them the messiah now was born where they might see him and to thee they came directed to the manger where thou lais't for in the inn was left no better room a star not seen before in heaven appearing guided the wise men thither from the east to honour thee with incense myrrh and gold by whose bright course led on they found the place affirming it thy star new grav'n in heaven by which they knew thee king of israel born just simeon and prophetic anna warn'd by vision found thee in the temple and spake before the altar and the vested priest like things of thee to all that present stood this having heard strait i again revolv'd the law and prophets searching what was writ concerning the messiah to our scribes known partly and soon found of whom they spake i am this chiefly that my way must lie through many a hard assay even to the death e 're i the promis 'd kingdom can attain or work redemption for mankind whose sins full weight must be transferr 'd upon my head yet neither thus disheartn 'd or dismay 'd the time prefixt i waited when behold the baptist of whose birth i oft had heard not knew by sight now come who was to come before messiah and his way prepare i as all others to his baptism came which i believ 'd was from above but he strait knew me and with loudest voice proclaim'd me him for it was shew'n him so from heaven me him whose harbinger he was and first refus 'd on me his baptism to confer as much his greater and was hardly won but as i rose out of the laving stream heaven open 'd her eternal doors from whence the spirit descended on me like a dove and last the sum of all my father 's voice audibly heard from heav'n pronounc 'd me his me his beloved son in whom alone he was well pleas 'd by which i knew the time now full that i no more should live obscure but openly begin as best becomes the authority which i deriv 'd from heaven and now by some strong motion i am led into this wilderness to what intent i learn not yet perhaps i need not know for what concerns my knowledge god reveals so spake our morning star then in his rise and looking round on every side beheld a pathless desert dusk with horrid shades the way he came not having mark 'd return was difficult by humane steps untrod and he still on was led but with such thoughts accompanied of things past and to come lodg 'd in his breast as well might recommend such solitude before choicest society full forty days he pass 'd whether on hill sometimes anon in shady vale each night under the covert of some ancient oak or cedar to defend him from the dew or harbour 'd in one cave is not reveal 'd nor tasted humane food nor hunger felt till those days ended hunger 'd then at last among wild beasts they at his sight grew mild nor sleeping him nor waking harm 'd his walk the fiery serpent fled and noxious worm the lion and fierce tiger glar 'd aloof but now an aged man in rural weeds following as seem 'd the quest of some stray ewe or wither 'd sticks to gather which might serve against a winters day when winds blow keen to warm him wet return 'd from field at eve he saw approach who first with curious eye perus 'd him then with words thus utt'red spake sir what ill chance hath brought thee to this place so far from path or road of men who pass in troop or caravan for single none durst ever who return 'd and dropt not here his carcass pin 'd with hunger and with droughth i ask the rather and the more admire for that to me thou seem'st the man whom late our new baptizing prophet at the ford of jordan honour 'd so and call 'd thee son of god i saw and heard for we sometimes who dwell this wild constrain 'd by want come forth to town or village nigh nighest is far where ought we hear and curious are to hear what happ'ns new fame also finds us out to whom the son of god who brought me hither will bring me hence no other guide i seek by miracle he may reply 'd the swain what other way i see not for we here live on tough roots and stubs to thirst inur'd more then the camel and to drink go far men to much misery and hardship born but if thou be the son of god command that out of these hard stones be made thee bread so shalt thou save thy self and us relieve with food whereof we wretched seldom taste he ended and the son of god reply 'd think'st thou such force in bread is it not written for i discern thee other then thou seem'st man lives not by bread only but each word proceeding from the mouth of god who fed our fathers here with manna in the mount moses was forty days nor eat nor drank and forty days eliah without food wandred this barren waste the same i now why dost thou then suggest to me distrust knowing who i am as i know who thou art whom thus answer 'd th arch fiend now undisguis 'd 't is true i am that spirit unfortunate who leagu 'd with millions more in rash revolt kept not my happy station but was driv'n with them from bliss to the bottomless deep yet to that hideous place not so confin'd by rigour unconniving but that oft leaving my dolorous prison i enjoy large liberty to round this globe of earth or range in th air nor from the heav'n of heav'ns hath he excluded my resort sometimes i came among the sons of god when he gave up into my hands uzzean job to prove him and illustrate his high worth and when to all his angels he propos'd to draw the proud king ahab into fraud that he might fall in ramoth they demuring i undertook that office and the tongues of all his flattering prophets glibb 'd with lyes to his destruction as i had in charge for what he bids i do though i have lost much lustre of my native brightness lost to be belov 'd of god i have not lost to love at least contemplate and admire what i see excellent in good or fair or vertuous i should so have lost all sense what can be then less in me then desire to see thee and approach thee whom i know declar 'd the son of god to hear attent thy wisdom and behold thy god-like deeds men generally think me much a foe to all mankind why should i they to me never did wrong or violence by them i lost not what i lost rather by them i gain 'd what i have gain 'd and with them dwell copartner in these regions of the world if not disposer lend them oft my aid oft my advice by presages and signs and answers oracles portents and dreams whereby they may direct their future life envy they say excites me thus to gain companions of my misery and wo at first it may be but long since with wo nearer acquainted now i feel by proof that fellowship in pain divides not smart nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load small consolation then were man adjoyn 'd this wounds me most what can it less that man man fall'n shall be restor 'd i never more to whom our saviour sternly thus reply 'd deservedly thou griev'st compos 'd of lyes from the beginning and in lies wilt end who boast'st release from hell and leave to come into the heav'n of heavens thou com'st indeed as a poor miserable captive thrall comes to the place where he before had sat among the prime in splendour now depos 'd ejected emptyed gaz 'd unpityed shun 'd a spectacle of ruin or of scorn to all the host of heaven the happy place imparts to thee no happiness no joy rather inflames thy torment representing lost bliss to thee no more communicable so never more in hell then when in heaven but thou art serviceable to heaven 's king wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear extorts or pleasure to do ill excites what but thy malice mov 'd thee to misdeem of righteous job then cruelly to afflict him with all inflictions but his patience won the other service was thy chosen task to be a lyer in four hundred mouths for lying is thy sustenance thy food yet thou pretend'st to truth all oracles by thee are giv'n and what confest more true among the nations that hath been thy craft by mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes but what have been thy answers what but dark ambiguous and with double sense deluding which they who ask 'd have seldom understood and not well understood as good not known who ever by consulting at thy shrine return 'd the wiser or the more instruct to flye or follow what concern 'd him most and run not sooner to his fatal snare for god hath justly giv'n the nations up to thy delusions justly since they fell idolatrous but when his purpose is among them to declare his providence to thee not known whence hast thou then thy truth but from him or his angels president in every province who themselves disdaining to approach thy temples give thee in command what to the smallest tittle thou shalt say to thy adorers thou with trembling fear or like a fawning parasite obey'st then to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told but this thy glory shall be soon retrench 'd no more shalt thou by oracling abuse the gentiles henceforth oracles are ceast and thou no more with pomp and sacrifice shalt be enquir 'd at delphos or elsewhere at least in vain for they shall find thee mute god hath now sent his living oracle into the world to teach his final will and sends his spirit of truth henceforth to dwell in pious hearts an inward oracle to all truth requisite for men to know so spake our saviour but the subtle fiend though inly stung with anger and disdain dissembl 'd and this answer smooth return 'd sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke and urg 'd me hard with doings which not will but misery hath rested from me where easily canst thou find one miserable and not inforc 'd oft-times to part from truth if it may stand him more in stead to lye say and unsay feign flatter or abjure but thou art plac't above me thou art lord from thee i can and must submiss endure check or reproof and glad to scape so quit hard are the ways of truth and rough to walk smooth on the tongue discourst pleasing to th ear and tuneable as silvan pipe or song what wonder then if i delight to hear her dictates from thy mouth most men admire vertue who follow not her lore permit me to hear thee when i come since no man comes and talk at least though i despair to attain thy father who is holy wise and pure suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest to tread his sacred courts and minister about his altar handling holy things praying or vowing and vouchsaf 'd his voice to balaam reprobate a prophet yet inspir 'd disdain not such access to me to whom our saviour with unalter 'd brow thy coming hither though i know thy scope i bid not or forbid do as thou find'st permission from above thou canst not more he added not and satan bowing low his gray dissimulation disappear'd into thin air diffus 'd for now began night with her sullen wing to double-shade the desert fowls in thir clay nests were couch't and now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam
mean while the new-baptiz 'd who yet remain'd at jordan with the baptist and had seen him whom they heard so late expresly call'd jesus messiah son of god declar 'd and on that high authority had believ 'd and with him talkt and with him lodg 'd i mean andrew and simon famous after known with others though in holy writ not nam 'd now missing him thir joy so lately found so lately found and so abruptly gone began to doubt and doubted many days and as the days increas 'd increas 'd thir doubt sometimes they thought he might be only shewn and for a time caught up to god as once moses was in the mount and missing long and the great thisbite who on fiery wheels rode up to heaven yet once again to come therefore as those young prophets then with care sought lost eliah so in each place these nigh to bethabara in jerico the city of palms ænon and salem old machærus and each town or city wall'd on this side the broad lake genezaret or in perea but return 'd in vain then on the bank of jordan by a creek where winds with reeds and osiers whisp'ring play plain fishermen no greater men them call close in a cottage low together got thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath 'd alas from what high hope to what relapse unlook 'd for are we fall'n our eyes beheld messiah certainly now come so long expected of our fathers we have heard his words his wisdom full of grace and truth now now for sure deliverance is at hand the kingdom shall to israel be restor 'd thus we rejoyc 'd but soon our joy is turn'd into perplexity and new amaze for whither is he gone what accident hath rapt him from us will he now retire after appearance and again prolong our expectation god of israel send thy messiah forth the time is come behold the kings of the earth how they oppress thy chosen to what highth thir pow'r unjust they have exalted and behind them cast all fear of thee arise and vindicate thy glory free thy people from thir yoke but let us wait thus far he hath perform 'd sent his anointed and to us reveal 'd him by his great prophet pointed at and shown in publick and with him we have convers 'd let us be glad of this and all our fears lay on his providence he will not fail nor will withdraw him now nor will recall mock us with his blest sight then snatch him hence soon we shall see our hope our joy return thus they out of their plaints new hope resume to find whom at the first they found unsought but to his mother mary when she saw others return 'd from baptism not her son nor left at jordan tydings of him none within her brest though calm her brest though pure motherly cares and fears got head and rais'd some troubl 'd thoughts which she in sighs thus clad o what avails me now that honour high to have conceiv 'd of god or that salute hale highly favour 'd among women blest while i to sorrows am no less advanc't and fears as eminent above the lot of other women by the birth i bore in such a season born when scarce a shed could be obtain 'd to shelter him or me from the bleak air a stable was our warmth a manger his yet soon enforc't to flye thence into egypt till the murd'rous king were dead who sought his life and missing fill'd with infant blood the streets of bethlehem from egypt home return 'd in nazareth hath been our dwelling many years his life private unactive calm contemplative little suspicious to any king but now full grown to man acknowledg 'd as i hear by john the baptist and in publick shown son own 'd from heaven by his father 's voice i look't for some great change to honour no but trouble as old simeon plain fore-told that to the fall and rising he should be of many in israel and to a sign spoken against that through my very soul a sword shall pierce this is my favour 'd lot my exaltation to afflictions high afflicted i may be it seems and blest i will not argue that nor will repine but where delays he now some great intent conceals him when twelve years he scarce had seen i lost him but so found as well i saw he could not lose himself but went about his father 's business what he meant i mus 'd since understand much more his absence now thus long to some great purpose he obscures but i to wait with patience am inur 'd my heart hath been a store-house long of things and sayings laid up portending strange events thus mary pondering oft and oft to mind recalling what remarkably had pass'd since first her salutation heard with thoughts meekly compos 'd awaited the fulfilling the while her son tracing the desert wild sole but with holiest meditations fed into himself descended and at once all his great work to come before him set how to begin how to accomplish best his end of being on earth and mission high for satan with slye preface to return had left him vacant and with speed was gon up

deceive ye to perswasion over-sure of like succeeding here i summon all rather to be in readiness with hand or counsel to assist lest i who erst thought none my equal now be over-match 'd so spake the old serpent doubting and from all with clamour was assur 'd thir utmost aid at his command when from amidst them rose belial the dissolutest spirit that fell the sensuallest and after asmodai the fleshliest incubus and thus advis 'd set women in his eye and in his walk among daughters of men the fairest found many are in each region passing fair as the noon skie more like to goddesses then mortal creatures graceful and discreet expert in amorous arts enchanting tongues perswasive virgin majesty with mild and sweet allay 'd yet terrible to approach skill 'd to retire and in retiring draw

desire and lead at will the manliest resolutest brest as the magnetic hardest iron draws women when nothing else beguil 'd the heart of wisest solomon and made him build and made him bow to the gods of his wives to whom quick answer satan thus return 'd belial in much uneven scale thou weigh'st all others by thy self because of old thou thy self doat'st on womankind admiring thir shape thir colour and attractive grace none are thou think'st but taken with such toys before the flood thou with thy lusty crew false titl 'd sons of god roaming the earth cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men and coupl 'd with them and begot a race have we not seen or by relation heard in courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st in wood or grove by mossie fountain side in valley or green meadow to way-lay some beauty rare calisto clymene daphne or semele antiopa or amymone syrinx many more too long then lay'st thy scapes on names ador 'd apollo neptune jupiter or pan satyr or fawn or silvan but these haunts delight not all among the sons of men how many have with a smile made small account of beauty and her lures easily scorn'd all her assaults on worthier things intent remember that pellean conquerour a youth how all the beauties of the east he slightly view 'd and slightly over-pass 'd how hee sirnam 'd of africa dismiss'd in his prime youth the fair iberian maid for solomon he liv 'd at ease and full of honour wealth high fare aim 'd not beyond higher design then to enjoy his state thence to the bait of women lay expos 'd but he whom we attempt is wiser far then solomon of more exalted mind made and set wholly on the accomplishment of greatest things what woman will you find though of this age the wonder and the fame on whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye of fond desire or should she confident as sitting queen ador 'd on beauties throne descend with all her winning charms begirt to enamour as the zone of venus once wrought that effect on jove so fables tell how would one look from his majestick brow seated as on the top of vertues hill discount'nance her despis 'd and put to rout all her array her female pride deject or turn to reverent awe for beauty stands in the admiration only of weak minds led captive cease to admire and all her plumes fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy at every sudden slighting quite abasht therefore with manlier objects we must try his constancy with such as have more shew of worth of honour glory and popular praise rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck 'd or that which only seems to satisfie lawful desires of nature not beyond and now i know he hungers where no food is to be found in the wide wilderness the rest commit to me i shall let pass no advantage and his strength as oft assay he ceas 'd and heard thir grant in loud acclaim then forthwith to him takes a chosen band of spirits likest to himself in guile to be at hand and at his beck appear if cause were to unfold some active scene of various persons each to know his part then to the desert takes with these his flight where still from shade to shade the son of god after forty days fasting had remain 'd now hungring first and to himself thus said where will this end four times ten days i have pass'd wandring this woody maze and humane food nor tasted nor had appetite that fast to vertue i impute not or count part of what i suffer here if nature need not or god support nature without repast though needing what praise is it to endure but now i feel i hunger which declares nature hath need of what she asks yet god can satisfie that need some other way though hunger still remain so it remain without this bodies wasting i content me and from the sting of famine fear no harm nor mind it fed with better thoughts that feed mee hungring more to do my fathers will it was the hour of night when thus the son commun 'd in silent walk then laid him down under the hospitable covert nigh of trees thick interwoven there he slept and dream 'd as appetite is wont to dream of meats and drinks natures refreshment sweet him thought he by the brook of cherith stood and saw the ravens with their horny beaks food to elijah bringing even and morn though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought he saw the prophet also how he fled into the desert and how there he slept under a juniper then how awakt he found his supper on the coals prepar 'd and by the angel was bid rise and eat and eat the second time after repose the strength whereof suffic 'd him forty days sometimes that with elijah he partook or as a guest with daniel at his pulse thus wore out night and now the herald lark left his ground-nest high towring to descry the morns approach and greet her with his song as lightly from his grassy couch up rose our saviour and found all was but a dream fasting he went to sleep and fasting wak 'd up to a hill anon his steps he rear 'd from whose high top to ken the prospect round if cottage were in view sheep-cote or herd but cottage herd or sheep-cote none he saw only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud thither he bent his way determin 'd there to rest at noon and entr 'd soon the shade high rooft and walks beneath and alleys brown that open 'd in the midst a woody scene natures own work it seem 'd nature taught art and to a superstitious eye the haunt of wood-gods and wood-nymphs he view 'd it round when suddenly a man before him stood not rustic as before but seemlier clad as one in city or court or palace bred and with fair speech these words to him address 'd with granted leave officious i return but much more wonder that the son of god in this wild solitude so long should bide of all things destitute and well i know not without hunger others of some note as story tells have trod this wilderness the fugitive bond-woman with her son out cast nebaioth yet found he relief by a providing angel all the race of israel here had famish 'd had not god rain 'd from heaven manna and that prophet bold native of thebes wandring here was fed twice by a voice inviting him to eat of thee these forty days none hath regard forty and more deserted here indeed to whom thus jesus what conclud'st thou hence they all had need i as thou seest have none how hast thou hunger then satan reply 'd tell me if food were now before thee set would'st thou not eat thereafter as i like the giver answer 'd jesus why should that cause thy refusal said the subtle fiend hast thou not right to all created things owe not all creatures by just right to thee duty and service nor to stay till bid but tender all their power nor mention i meats by the law unclean or offer 'd first to idols those young daniel could refuse nor proffer 'd by an enemy though who would scruple that with want opprest behold nature asham 'd or better to express troubl 'd that thou shouldst hunger hath purvey'd from all the elements her choicest store to treat thee as beseems and as her lord with honour only deign to sit and eat he spake no dream for as his words had end our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld in ample space under the broadest shade a table richly spred in regal mode with dishes pill 'd and meats of noblest sort and savour beasts of chase or fowl of game in pastry built or from the spit or boyl 'd gris-amber-steam 'd all fish from sea or shore freshet or purling brook of shell or fin and exquisitest name for which was drain'd pontus and lucrine bay and afric coast alas how simple to these cates compar 'd was that crude apple that diverted eve and at a stately side-board by the wine that fragrant smell diffus 'd in order stood tall stripling youths rich clad of fairer hew then ganymed or hylas distant more under the trees now trip 'd now solemn stood nymphs of diana 's train and naiades with fruits and flowers from amalthea 's horn and ladies of th hesperides that seem'd fairer then feign 'd of old or fabl 'd since of fairy damsels met in forest wide by knights of logres or of lyones lancelot or pelleas or pellenore and all the while harmonious airs were heard of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds of gentlest gale arabian odors fann'd from their soft wings and flora 's earliest smells such was the splendour and the tempter now his invitation earnestly renew 'd what doubts the son of god to sit and eat these are not fruits forbidden no interdict defends the touching of these viands pure thir taste no knowledge works at least of evil but life preserves destroys life 's enemy hunger with sweet restorative delight all these are spirits of air and woods and springs thy gentle ministers who come to pay thee homage and acknowledge thee thir lord what doubt'st thou son of god sit down and eat to whom thus jesus temperately reply 'd said'st thou not that to all things i had right and who withholds my pow'r that right to use shall i receive by gift what of my own when and where likes me best i can command i can at will doubt not as soon as thou command a table in this wilderness and call swift flights of angels ministrant array 'd in glory on my cup to attend why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence in vain where no acceptance it can find and with my hunger what has thou to do thy pompous delicacies i contemn and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles to whom thus answer 'd satan malecontent that i have also power to give thou seest if of that pow'r i bring thee voluntary what i might have bestow 'd on whom i pleas 'd and rather opportunely in this place chose to impart to thy apparent need why shouldst thou not accept it but i see what i can do or offer is suspect of these things others quickly will dispose whose pains have earn 'd the far fet spoil with that both table and provision vanish 'd quite with sound of harpies wings and talons heard only the importune tempter still remain 'd and with these words his temptation pursu 'd by hunger that each other creature tames thou art not to be harm 'd therefore not mov 'd thy temperance invincible besides for no allurement yields to appetite and all thy heart is set on high designs high actions but wherewith to be atchiev 'd great acts require great means of enterprise thou art unknown unfriended low of birth a carpenter thy father known thy self bred up in poverty and streights at home lost in a desert here and hunger-bit which way or from what hope dost thou aspire to greatness whence authority deriv'st what followers what retinue canst thou gain or at thy heels the dizzy multitude longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost money brings honour friends conquest and realms what rais 'd antipater the edomite and his son herod plac 'd on juda 's throne thy throne but gold that got him puissant friends therefore if at great things thou wouldst arrive get riches first get wealth and treasure heap not difficult if thou hearken to me riches are mine fortune is in my hand they whom i favour thrive in wealth amain while virtue valour wisdom sit in want to whom thus jesus patiently reply 'd yet wealth without these three is impotent to gain dominion or to keep it gain 'd witness those antient empires of the earth in highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv 'd but men endu 'd with these have oft attain'd in lowest poverty to highest deeds gideon and jephtha and the shepherd lad whose off-spring on the throne of juda sat so many ages and shall yet regain that seat and reign in israel without end among the heathen for throughout the world to me is not unknown what hath been done worthy of memorial canst thou not remember quintius fabricius curius regulus for i esteem those names of men so poor who could do mighty things and could contemn riches though offer 'd from the hand of kings and what in me seems wanting but that i may also in this poverty as soon accomplish what they did perhaps and more extol not riches then the toyl of fools the wise mans cumbrance if not snare more apt to slacken virtue and abate her edge then prompt her to do aught may merit praise what if with like aversion i reject riches and realms yet not for that a crown golden in shew is but a wreath of thorns brings dangers troubles cares and sleepless nights to him who wears the regal diadem when on his shoulders each mans burden lies for therein stands the office of a king his honour vertue merit and chief praise that for the publick all this weight he bears yet he who reigns within himself and rules passions desires and fears is more a king which every wise and vertuous man attains and who attains not ill aspires to rule cities of men or head-strong multitudes subject himself to anarchy within or lawless passions in him which he serves but to guide nations in the way of truth by saving doctrine and from errour lead to know and knowing worship god aright is yet more kingly this attracts the soul governs the inner man the nobler part that other o 're the body only reigns and oft by force which to a generous mind so reigning can be no sincere delight besides to give a kingdom hath been thought greater and nobler done and to lay down far more magnanimous then to assume riches are needless then both for themselves and for thy reason why they should be sought to gain a scepter oftest better miss't
so spake the son of god and satan stood a while as mute confounded what to say what to reply confuted and convinc't of his weak arguing and fallacious drift at length collecting all his serpent wiles with soothing words renew 'd him thus accosts i see thou know'st what is of use to know what best to say canst say to do canst do thy actions to thy words accord thy words to thy large heart give utterance due thy heart conteins of good wise just the perfect shape should kings and nations from thy mouth consult thy counsel would be as the oracle urim and thummim those oraculous gems on aaron 's breast or tongue of seers old infallible or wert thou sought to deeds that might require th array of war thy skill of conduct would be such that all the world could not sustain thy prowess or subsist in battel though against thy few in arms these god-like vertues wherefore dost thou hide affecting private life or more obscure in savage wilderness wherefore deprive all earth her wonder at thy acts thy self the fame and glory glory the reward that sole excites to high attempts the flame of most erected spirits most temper 'd pure ætherial who all pleasures else despise all treasures and all gain esteem as dross and dignities and powers all but the highest thy years are ripe and over-ripe the son of macedonian philip had e 're these won asia and the throne of cyrus held at his dispose young scipio had brought down the carthaginian pride young pompey quell'd the pontic king and in triumph had rode yet years and to ripe years judgment mature quench not the thirst of glory but augment great julius whom now all the world admires the more he grew in years the more inflam'd with glory wept that he had liv 'd so long inglorious but thou yet art not too late to whom our saviour calmly thus reply 'd thou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth for empires sake nor empire to affect for glories sake by all thy argument for what is glory but the blaze of fame the peoples praise if always praise unmixt and what the people but a herd confus 'd a miscellaneous rabble who extol things vulgar well weigh 'd scarce worth the praise they praise and they admire they know not what and know not whom but as one leads the other and what delight to be by such extoll 'd to live upon thir tongues and be thir talk of whom to be disprais 'd were no small praise his lot who dares be singularly good th intelligent among them and the wise are few and glory scarce of few is rais 'd this is true glory and renown when god looking on the earth with approbation marks the just man and divulges him through heaven to all his angels who with true applause recount his praises thus he did to job when to extend his fame through heaven earth as thou to thy reproach mayst well remember he ask 'd thee hast thou seen my servant job famous he was in heaven on earth less known where glory is false glory attributed to things not glorious men not worthy of fame they err who count it glorious to subdue by conquest far and wide to over-run large countries and in field great battels win great cities by assault what do these worthies but rob and spoil burn slaughter and enslave peaceable nations neighbouring or remote made captive yet deserving freedom more then those thir conquerours who leave behind nothing but ruin wheresoe 're they rove and all the flourishing works of peace

discover them scarce men rowling in brutish vices and deform 'd violent or shameful death thir due reward but if there be in glory aught of good it may by means far different be attain'd without ambition war or violence by deeds of peace by wisdom eminent by patience temperance i mention still him whom thy wrongs with saintly patience born made famous in a land and times obscure who names not

reward shall i seek glory then as vain men seek oft not deserv 'd i seek not mine but his who sent me and thereby witness whence i am to whom the tempter murmuring thus reply 'd think not so slight of glory therein least resembling thy great father he seeks glory and for his glory all things made all things orders and governs nor content in heaven by all his angels glorifi 'd requires glory from men from all men good or bad wise or unwise no difference no exemption above all sacrifice or hallow 'd gift glory he requires and glory he receives promiscuous from all nations jew or greek or barbarous nor exception hath declar 'd from us his foes pronounc't glory he exacts to whom our saviour fervently reply 'd and reason since his word all things produc 'd though chiefly not for glory as prime end but to shew forth his goodness and impart his good communicable to every soul freely of whom what could he less expect then glory and benediction that is thanks the slightest easiest readiest recompence from them who could return him nothing else and not returning that would likeliest render contempt instead dishonour obloquy hard recompence unsutable return for so much good so much beneficence but why should man seek glory who of his own hath nothing and to whom nothing belongs but condemnation ignominy and shame who for so many benefits receiv'd turn 'd recreant to god ingrate and false and so of all true good himself despoil 'd yet sacrilegious to himself would take that which to god alone of right belongs yet so much bounty is in god such grace that who advance his glory not thir own them he himself to glory will advance so spake the son of god and here again satan had not to answer but stood struck with guilt of his own sin for he himself insatiable of glory had lost all yet of another plea bethought him soon of glory as thou wilt said he so deem worth or not worth the seeking let it pass but to a kingdom thou art born ordain'd to sit upon thy father david 's throne by mothers side thy father though thy right be now in powerful hands that will not part easily from possession won with arms judæa now and all the promis 'd land reduc't a

prophets old who sung thy endless raign the happier raign the sooner it begins raign then what canst thou better do the while to whom our saviour answer thus return 'd all things are best fullfil 'd in their due time and time there is for all things truth hath said if of my raign prophetic writ hath told that it shall never end so when begin the father in his purpose hath decreed he in whose hand all times and seasons roul what if he hath decreed that i shall first be try 'd in humble state and things adverse by tribulations injuries insults contempts and scorns and snares and violence

merit my exaltation without change or end but what concerns it thee when i begin my everlasting kingdom why art thou sollicitous what moves thy inquisition know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall and my promotion will be thy destruction to whom the tempter inly rackt reply 'd let that come when it comes all hope is lost of my reception into grace what worse for where no hope is left is left no fear if there be worse the expectation more of worse torments me then the feeling can i would be at the worst worst is my port my harbour and my ultimate repose the end i would attain my final good my error was my error and my crime my crime whatever for it self condemn 'd and will alike be punish 'd whether thou raign or raign not though to that gentle brow willingly i could flye and hope thy raign from that placid aspect and meek regard rather then aggravate my evil state would stand between me and thy fathers ire whose ire i dread more then the fire of hell a shelter and a kind of shading cool interposition as a summers cloud if i then to the worst that can be hast why move thy feet so slow to what is best happiest both to thy self and all the world that thou who worthiest art should'st be thir king perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detain'd of the enterprize so hazardous and high no wonder for though in thee be united what of perfection can in man be found or human nature can receive consider thy life hath yet been private most part spent at home scarce view 'd the gallilean towns and once a year jerusalem few days short sojourn and what thence could'st thou observe the world thou hast not seen much less her glory empires and monarchs and thir radiant courts best school of best experience quickest in sight in all things that to greatest actions lead the wisest unexperienc't will be ever timorous and loth with novice modesty as he who seeking asses found a kingdom irresolute unhardy unadventrous but i will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit those rudiments and see before thine eyes the monarchies of the earth thir pomp and state sufficient introduction to inform thee of thy self so apt in regal arts and regal mysteries that thou may'st know how best their opposition to withstand with that such power was giv'n him then he took the son of god up to a mountain high it was a mountain at whose verdant feet a spatious plain out stretch't in circuit wide lay pleasant from his side two rivers flow 'd th one winding the other strait and left between fair champain with less rivers interveind then meeting joyn 'd thir tribute to the sea fertil of corn the glebe of oyl and wine with herds the pastures throng 'd with flocks the hills huge cities and high towr 'd that well might seem the seats of mightiest monarchs and so large the prospect was that here and there was room for barren desert fountainless and dry to this high mountain top the tempter brought our saviour and new train of words began well have we speeded and o 're hill and dale forest and field and flood temples and towers cut shorter many a league here thou behold'st assyria and her empires antient bounds araxes and the caspian lake thence on as far as indus east euphrates west and oft beyond to south the persian bay and inaccessible the arabian drouth here ninevee of length within her wall several days journey built by ninus old of that first golden monarchy the seat and seat of salmanassar whose success israel in long captivity still mourns there babylon the wonder of all tongues as antient but rebuilt by him who twice judah and all thy father david 's house led captive and jerusalem laid waste till cyrus set them free persepolis his city there thou seest and bactra there ecbatana her structure vast there shews and hecatompylos her hunderd gates there susa by choaspes amber stream the drink of none but kings of later fame built by emathian or by parthian hands the great seleucia nisibis and there artaxata teredon tesiphon turning with easie eye thou may'st behold all these the parthian now some ages past by great arsaces led who founded first that empire under his dominion holds from the luxurious kings of antioch won and just in time thou com'st to have a view of his great power for now the parthian king in ctesiphon hath gather 'd all his host against the scythian whose incursions wild have wasted sogdiana to her aid he marches now in hast see though from far his thousands in what martial equipage they issue forth steel bows and shafts their arms of equal dread in flight or in pursuit all horsemen in which fight they most excel see how in warlike muster they appear in rhombs and wedges and half moons and wings he look't and saw what numbers numberless the city gates out powr 'd light armed troops in coats of mail and military pride in mail thir horses clad yet fleet and strong prauncing their riders bore the flower and choice of many provinces from bound to bound from arachosia from candaor east and margiana to the hyrcanian cliffs of caucasus and dark iberian dales from atropatia and the neighbouring plains of adiabene media and the south of susiana to balsara 's hav'n he saw them in thir forms of battell rang 'd how quick they wheel 'd and flying behind them shot sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face of thir pursuers and overcame by flight the field all iron cast a gleaming brown nor wanted clouds of foot nor on each horn cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight chariots or elephants endorst with towers of archers nor of labouring pioners a multitude with spades and axes arm'd to lay hills plain fell woods or valleys fill or where plain was raise hill or over-lay with bridges rivers proud as with a yoke mules after these camels and dromedaries and waggons fraught with utensils of war such forces met not nor so wide a camp when agrican with all his northern powers besieg 'd albracca as romances tell the city of gallaphrone from thence to win the fairest of her sex angelica his daughter sought by many prowest knights both paynim and the peers of charlemane such and so numerous was thir chivalrie at sight whereof the fiend yet more presum 'd and to our saviour thus his words renew 'd that thou may'st know i seek not to engage thy vertue and not every way secure on no slight grounds thy safety hear and mark to what end i have brought thee hither and shewn all this fair sight thy kingdom though foretold by prophet or by angel unless thou endeavour as thy father david did thou never shalt obtain prediction still in all things and all men supposes means without means us 'd what it predicts revokes but say thou wer't possess 'd of david 's throne by free consent of all none opposite samaritan or jew how could'st thou hope long to enjoy it quiet and secure between two such enclosing enemies roman and parthian therefore one of these thou must make sure thy own the parthian first by my advice as nearer and of late found able by invasion to annoy thy country and captive lead away her kings antigonus and old hyrcanus bound maugre the roman it shall be my task to render thee the parthian at dispose chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league by him thou shalt regain without him not that which alone can truly reinstall thee in david 's royal seat his true successour deliverance of thy brethren those ten tribes whose off-spring in his territory yet serve in habor and among the medes dispers't ten sons of jacob two of joseph lost thus long from israel serving as of old thir fathers in the land of egypt serv 'd this offer sets before thee to deliver these if from servitude thou shalt restore to thir inheritance then nor till then thou on the throne of david in full glory from egypt to euphrates and beyond shalt raign and rome or caesar not need fear to whom our saviour answer 'd thus unmov 'd much ostentation vain of fleshly arm and fragile arms much instrument of war long in preparing soon to nothing brought before mine eyes thou hast set and in my ear vented much policy and projects deep of enemies of aids battels and leagues plausible to the world to me worth naught means i must use thou say'st prediction else will unpredict and fail me of the throne my time i told thee and that time for thee were better farthest off is not yet come when that comes think not thou to find me slack on my part aught endeavouring or to need thy politic maxims or that cumbersome luggage of war there shewn me argument of human weakness rather then of strength my brethren as thou call'st them those ten tribes i must deliver if i mean to raign david 's true heir and his full scepter sway to just extent over all israel 's sons but whence to thee this zeal where was it then for israel or for david or his throne when thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride of numbring israel which cost the lives of threescore and ten thousand israelites by three days pestilence such was thy zeal to israel then the same that now to me as for those captive tribes themselves were they who wrought their own captivity fell off from god to worship calves the deities of egypt baal next and ashtaroth and all the idolatries of heathen round besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes nor in the land of their captivity humbled themselves or penitent besought the god of their fore-fathers but so dy'd impenitent and left a race behind like to themselves distinguishable scarce from gentils but by circumcision vain and god with idols in their worship joyn 'd should i of these the liberty regard who freed as to their antient patrimony unhumbl 'd unrepentant unreform 'd headlong would follow and to thir gods perhaps of bethel and of dan no let them serve thir enemies who serve idols with god yet he at length time to himself best known remembring abraham by some wond'rous call may bring them back repentant and sincere and at their passing cleave the assyrian flood while to their native land with joy they hast as the red sea and jordan once he cleft when to the promis 'd land thir fathers pass 'd to his due time and providence i leave them so spake israel 's true king and to the fiend made answer meet that made void all his wiles so fares it when with truth falshood contends
perplex 'd and troubl 'd at his bad success the tempter stood nor had what to reply discover 'd in his fraud thrown from his hope so oft and the perswasive rhetoric that sleek't his tongue and won so much on eve so little here nay lost but eve was eve this far his over-match who self deceiv'd and rash before-hand had no better weigh'd the strength he was to cope with or his own but as a man who had been matchless held in cunning over-reach't where least he thought to salve his credit and for very spight still will be tempting him who foyls him still and never cease though to his shame the more or as a swarm of flies in vintage time about the wine-press where sweet moust is powr 'd beat off returns as oft with humming sound or surging waves against a solid rock though all to shivers dash't the assault renew vain battry and in froth or bubbles end so satan whom repulse upon repulse met ever and to shameful silence brought yet gives not o 're though desperate of success and his vain importunity pursues he brought our saviour to the western side of that high mountain whence he might behold another plain long but in bredth not wide wash 'd by the southern sea and on the north to equal length back 'd with a ridge of hills that screen 'd the fruits of the earth and seats of men from cold septentrion blasts thence in the midst divided by a river of whose banks on each side an imperial city stood with towers and temples proudly elevate on seven small hills with palaces adorn 'd porches and theatres baths aqueducts statues and trophees and triumphal arcs gardens and groves presented to his eyes above the highth of mountains interpos 'd by what strange parallax or optic skill of vision multiplyed through air or glass of telescope were curious to enquire and now the tempter thus his silence broke the city which thou seest no other deem then great and glorious rome queen of the earth so far renown 'd and with the spoils enricht of nations there the capitol thou seest above the rest lifting his stately head on the tarpeian rock her cittadel impregnable and there mount palatine the imperial palace compass huge and high the structure skill of noblest architects

wealth and power civility of manners arts and arms and long renown thou justly may'st prefer before the parthian these two thrones except the rest are barbarous and scarce worth the sight shar 'd among petty kings too far remov 'd these having shewn thee i have shewn thee all the kingdoms of the world and all thir glory this emperour hath no son and now is old old and lascivious and from rome retir'd to capreæ an island small but strong on the campanian shore with purpose there his horrid lusts in private to enjoy committing to a wicked favourite all publick cares and yet of him suspicious hated of all and hating with what ease indu 'd with regal vertues as thou art appearing and beginning noble deeds might'st thou expel this monster from his throne now made a stye and in his place ascending a victor people free from servile yoke and with my help thou may'st to me the power is given and by that right i give it thee aim therefore at no less then all the world aim at the highest without the highest attain'd will be for thee no sitting or not long on david 's throne be propheci 'd what will to whom the son of god unmov 'd reply 'd nor doth this grandeur and majestic show of luxury though call 'd magnificence more then of arms before allure mine eye much less my mind though thou should'st add to tell thir sumptuous gluttonies and gorgeous feasts on cittron tables or atlantic stone for i have also heard perhaps have read their wines of setia cales and falerne chios and creet and how they quaff in gold crystal and myrrhine cups imboss 'd with gems and studs of pearl to me should'st tell who thirst and hunger still then embassies thou shew'st from nations far and nigh what honour that but tedious wast of time to sit and hear so many hollow complements and lies outlandish flatteries then proceed'st to talk of the emperour how easily subdu 'd how gloriously i shall thou say'st expel a brutish monster what if i withal expel a devil who first made him such let his tormenter conscience find him out for him i was not sent nor yet to free that people victor once now vile and base deservedly made vassal who once just frugal and mild and temperate conquer 'd well but govern ill the nations under yoke peeling thir provinces exhausted all by lust and rapine first ambitious grown of triumph that insulting vanity then cruel by thir sports to blood enur'd of fighting beasts and men to beasts expos 'd luxurious by thir wealth and greedier still and from the daily scene effeminate what wise and valiant man would seek to free these thus degenerate by themselves enslav 'd or could of inward slaves make outward free know therefore when my season comes to sit on david 's throne it shall be like a tree spreading and over-shadowing all the earth or as a stone that shall to pieces dash all monarchies besides throughout the world and of my kingdom there shall be no end means there shall be to this but what the means is not for thee to know nor me to tell to whom the tempter impudent repli 'd i see all offers made by me how slight thou valu'st because offer 'd and reject'st nothing will please the difficult and nice or nothing more then still to contradict on the other side know also thou that i on what i offer set as high esteem nor what i part with mean to give for naught all these which in a moment thou behold'st the kingdoms of the world to thee i give for giv'n to me i give to whom i please no trifle yet with this reserve not else on this condition if thou wilt fall down and worship me as thy superior lord easily done and hold them all of me for what can less so great a gift deserve whom thus our saviour answer 'd with disdain i never lik 'd thy talk thy offers less now both abhor since thou hast dar 'd to utter the abominable terms impious condition but i endure the time till which expir 'd thou hast permission on me it is written the first of all commandments thou shalt worship the lord thy god and only him shalt serve and dar'st thou to the son of god propound to worship thee accurst now more accurst for this attempt bolder then that on eve and more blasphemous which expect to rue the kingdoms of the world to thee were giv'n permitted rather and by thee usurp't other donation none thou canst produce if given by whom but by the king of kings god over all supreme if giv'n to thee by thee how fairly is the giver now repaid but gratitude in thee is lost long since wert thou so void of fear or shame as offer them to me the son of god to me my own on such abhorred pact that i fall down and worship thee as god get thee behind me plain thou now appear'st that evil one satan for ever damn 'd to whom the fiend with fear abasht reply 'd be not so sore offended son of god though sons of god both angels are and men if i to try whether in higher sort then these thou bear'st that title have propos'd what both from men and angels i receive tetrarchs of fire air flood and on the earth nations besides from all

left and more esteem me naught advantag 'd missing what i aim 'd therefore let pass as they are transitory the kingdoms of this world i shall no more advise thee gain them as thou canst or not and thou thy self seem'st otherwise inclin'd then to a worldly crown addicted more to contemplation and profound dispute as by that early action may be judg 'd when slipping from thy mothers eye thou

himself on grace depending much of the soul they talk but all awrie and in themselves seek vertue and to themselves all glory arrogate to god give none rather accuse him under usual names fortune and

remains deep verst in books and shallow in himself crude or intoxicate collecting toys and trifles for choice matters worth a spunge as children gathering pibles on the shore or if i would delight my

rome in them is plainest taught and easiest learnt what makes a nation happy and keeps it so what ruins kingdoms and lays cities flat these only with our law best form a king so spake the son of god but satan now quite at a loss for all his darts were spent thus to our saviour with stern brow reply 'd since neither wealth nor honour arms nor arts kingdom nor empire pleases thee nor aught by me propos 'd in life contemplative or active tended on by glory or fame what dost thou in this world the wilderness for thee is fittest place i found thee there and thither will return thee yet remember what i foretell thee soon thou shalt have cause to wish thou never hadst rejected thus nicely or cautiously my offer 'd aid which would have set thee in short time with ease on david 's throne or throne of all the world now at full age fulness of time thy season when prophesies of thee are best fullfill 'd now contrary if i read aught in heaven or heav'n write aught of fate by what the stars voluminous or single characters in their conjunction met give me to spell sorrows and labours opposition hate attends thee scorns reproaches injuries violence and stripes and lastly cruel death a kingdom they portend thee but what kingdom real or allegoric i discern not nor when eternal sure as without end without beginning for no date prefixt directs me in the starry rubric set so saying he took for still he knew his power not yet expir 'd and to the wilderness brought back the son of god and left him there feigning to disappear darkness now rose as day-light sunk and brought in lowring night her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both privation meer of light and absent day our saviour meek and with untroubl 'd mind after his aerie jaunt though hurried sore hungry and cold betook him to his rest wherever under some concourse of shades whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield from dews and damps of night his shelter 'd head but shelter 'd slept in vain for at his head the tempter watch 'd and soon with ugly dreams disturb 'd his sleep and either tropic now gan thunder and both ends of heav'n the clouds from many a horrid rift abortive pour'd fierce rain with lightning mixt water with fire in ruine reconcil 'd nor slept the winds within thir stony caves but rush 'd abroad from the four hinges of the world and fell on the vext wilderness whose tallest pines though rooted deep as high and sturdiest oaks bow 'd their stiff necks loaden with stormy blasts or torn up sheer ill wast thou shrouded then o patient son of god yet only stoodst unshaken nor yet staid the terror there infernal ghosts and hellish furies round environ 'd thee some howl 'd some yell 'd some shriek 'd some bent at thee thir fiery darts while thou sat'st unappall 'd in calm and sinless peace thus pass 'd the night so foul till morning fair came forth with pilgrim steps in amice gray who with her radiant finger still 'd the roar of thunder chas 'd the clouds and laid the winds and grisly spectres which the fiend had rais'd to tempt the son of god with terrors dire and now the sun with more effectual beams had chear 'd the face of earth and dry 'd the wet from drooping plant or dropping tree the birds who all things now behold more fresh and green after a night of storm so ruinous clear 'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray to gratulate the sweet return of morn nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn was absent after all his mischief done the prince of darkness glad would also seem of this fair change and to our saviour came yet with no new device they all were spent rather by this his last affront resolv 'd desperate of better course to vent his rage and mad despight to be so oft repell 'd him walking on a sunny hill he found back 'd on the north and west by a thick wood out of the wood he starts in wonted shape and in a careless mood thus to him said fair morning yet betides thee son of god after a dismal night i heard the rack as earth and skie would mingle but my self was distant and these flaws though mortals fear them as dangerous to the pillard frame of heaven or to the earths dark basis underneath are to the main as inconsiderable and harmless if not wholsom as a sneeze to mans less universe and soon are gone yet as being oft times noxious where they light on man beast plant wastful and turbulent like turbulencies in the affairs of men over whose heads they rore and seem to point they oft fore-signifie and threaten ill this tempest at this desert most was bent of men at thee for only thou here dwell'st did i not tell thee if thou didst reject the perfet season offer 'd with my aid to win thy destin 'd seat but wilt prolong all to the push of fate persue thy way of gaining david 's throne no man knows when for both the when and how is no where told thou shalt be what thou art ordain 'd no doubt for angels have proclaim 'd it but concealing the time and means each act is rightliest done not when it must but when it may be best if thou observe not this be sure to find what i foretold thee many a hard assay of dangers and adversities and pains e 're thou of israel 's scepter get fast hold whereof this ominous night that clos 'd thee round so many terrors voices prodigies may warn thee as a sure fore-going sign so talk 'd he while the son of god went on and staid not but in brief him answer 'd thus mee worse then wet thou find'st not other harm those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none i never fear 'd they could though noising loud and threatning nigh what they can do as signs betok'ning or ill boding i contemn as false portents not sent from god but thee who knowing i shall raign past thy preventing obtrud'st thy offer 'd aid that i accepting at least might seem to hold all power of thee ambitious spirit and wouldst be thought my god and storm'st refus 'd thinking to terrifie mee to thy will desist thou art discern'd and toil'st in vain nor me in vain molest to whom the fiend now swoln with rage reply 'd then hear o son of david virgin-born for son of god to me is yet in doubt of the messiah i have heard foretold by all the prophets of thy birth at length announc't by gabriel with the first i knew and of the angelic song in bethlehem field on thy birth-night that sung thee saviour born from that time seldom have i ceas 'd to eye thy infancy thy childhood and thy youth thy manhood last though yet in private bred till at the ford of jordan whither all flock 'd to the baptist i among the rest though not to be baptiz 'd by voice from heav'n heard thee pronounc 'd the son of god belov 'd thenceforth i thought thee worth my nearer view and narrower scrutiny that i might learn in what degree or meaning thou art call'd the son of god which bears no single sence the son of god i also am or was and if i was i am relation stands all men are sons of god yet thee i thought in some respect far higher so declar 'd therefore i watch 'd thy footsteps from that hour and follow 'd thee still on to this wast wild where by all best conjectures i collect thou art to be my fatal enemy good reason then if i before-hand seek to understand my adversary who and what he is his wisdom power intent by parl or composition truce or league to win him or win from him what i can and opportunity i here have had to try thee sift thee and confess have found thee proof against all temptation as a rock of adamant and as a center firm to the utmost of meer man both wise and good not more for honours riches kingdoms glory have been before contemn 'd and may agen therefore to know what more thou art then man worth naming son of god by voice from heav'n another method i must now begin so saying he caught him up and without wing of hippogrif bore through the air sublime over the wilderness and o 're the plain till underneath them fair jerusalem the holy city lifted high her towers and higher yet the glorious temple rear'd her pile far off appearing like a mount of alabaster top't with golden spires there on the highest pinacle he set the son of god and added thus in scorn there stand if thou wilt stand to stand upright will ask thee skill i to thy fathers house have brought thee and highest plac't highest is best now shew thy progeny if not to stand cast thy self down safely if son of god for it is written he will give command concerning thee to his angels in thir hands they shall up lift thee lest at any time thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone to whom thus jesus also it is written tempt not the lord thy god he said and stood but satan smitten with amazement fell as when earths son antæus to compare small things with greatest in irassa strove with joves alcides and oft foil 'd still rose receiving from his mother earth new strength fresh from his fall and fiercer grapple joyn 'd throttl 'd at length in the air expir 'd and fell so after many a foil the tempter proud renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride fell whence he stood to see his victor fall and as that theban monster that propos'd her riddle and him who solv 'd it not devour 'd that once found out and solv 'd for grief and spight cast her self headlong from th ismenian steep so strook with dread and anguish fell the fiend and to his crew that sat consulting brought joyless triumphals of his hop't success ruin and desperation and dismay who durst so proudly tempt the son of god so satan fell and strait a fiery globe of angels on full sail of wing flew nigh who on their plumy vans receiv 'd him soft from his uneasie station and upbore as on a floating couch through the blithe air then in a flowry valley set him down on a green bank and set before him spred a table of celestial food divine ambrosial fruits fetcht from the tree of life and from the fount of life ambrosial drink that soon refresh 'd him wearied and repair'd what hunger if aught hunger had impair 'd or thirst and as he fed angelic quires sung heavenly anthems of his victory over temptation and the

o thy bright eyes must answer now when reason with a scornful brow is mocking at my overthrow o thy sweet tongue must plead for me and tell why i have chosen thee stern reason is to judgment come arrayed in all her forms of gloom wilt thou my advocate be dumb no radiant angel speak and say why i did cast the world away why i have persevered to shun the common paths that others run and on a strange road journeyed on heedless alike of wealth and power— of glory 's wreath and pleasure 's flower these once indeed seemed beings divine and they perchance heard vows of mine and saw my offerings on their shrine— but careless gifts are seldom prized and mine were worthily despised so with a ready heart i swore to seek their altar-stone no more and gave my spirit to adore thee ever present phantom thing— my slave my comrade and my king a slave because i rule thee still incline thee to my changeful will and make thy influence good or ill— a comrade for by day and night thou art my intimate delight— my darling pain that wounds and sears and wrings a blessing out from tears by deadening me to real cares and yet a king—though prudence well have taught thy subject to rebel and am i wrong to worship where faith can not doubt nor hope despair since my own soul can grant my prayer speak god of visions plead for me and tell why i have chosen thee

your petitions—though they continue to bear just the one signature—have been duly recorded your anxieties—despite their constant relatively narrow scope and inadvertent entertainment value—nonetheless serve to bring your person vividly to mind your repentance—all but obscured beneath a burgeoning yellow fog of frankly more conspicuous resentment—is sufficient your intermittent concern for the sick the suffering the needy poor is sometimes recognizable to me if not to them your angers your zeal your lipsmackingly righteous indignation toward the many whose habits and sympathies offend you— these must burn away before you ’ ll apprehend how near i am with what fervor i adore precisely these the several who rouse your passions

i the winter evening settles down with smell of steaks in passageways six o ’ clock the burnt-out ends of smoky days and now a gusty shower wraps the grimy scraps of withered leaves about your feet and newspapers from vacant lots the showers beat on broken blinds and chimney-pots and at the corner of the street a lonely cab-horse steams and stamps and then the lighting of the lamps ii the morning comes to consciousness of faint stale smells of beer from the sawdust-trampled street with all its muddy feet that press to early coffee-stands with the other masquerades that time resumes one thinks of all the hands that are raising dingy shades in a thousand furnished rooms iii you tossed a blanket from the bed you lay upon your back and waited you dozed and watched the night revealing the thousand sordid images of which your soul was constituted they flickered against the ceiling and when all the world came back and the light crept up between the shutters and you heard the sparrows in the gutters you had such a vision of the street as the street hardly understands sitting along the bed ’ s edge where you curled the papers from your hair or clasped the yellow soles of feet in the palms of both soiled hands iv his soul stretched tight across the skies that fade behind a city block or trampled by insistent feet at four and five and six o ’ clock and short square fingers stuffing pipes and evening newspapers and eyes assured of certain certainties the conscience of a blackened street impatient to assume the world i am moved by fancies that are curled around these images and cling the notion of some infinitely gentle infinitely suffering thing wipe your hand across your mouth and laugh the worlds revolve like ancient women gathering fuel in vacant lots

lit with strange carpentry magic — they build time-shares in her head they carve names deep in wood erect beams of metal to hold up the invincible defense of a bad history they mourn what ’ s subjective they are shutters closed sometimes i imagine such men in flip-flops with fat towels draped over confident shoulders i imagine they all live in texas and find south padre too hot and then i imagine them blaming diversity for everything here in the middle of grief we pout to the rhythm of their sentences suns hiss in their dreams soon such critics will meet daily for prayers the pharisees identify the guilty woman they are gathering sticks for a witch burning curandera lit with the fire of sighs casts spells burns sage sweats in a lodge her own prayers flaming
titan to whose immortal eyes the sufferings of mortality seen in their sad reality were not as things that gods despise what was thy pity 's recompense a silent suffering and intense the rock the vulture and the chain all that the proud can feel of pain the agony they do not show the suffocating sense of woe which speaks but in its loneliness and then is jealous lest the sky should have a listener nor will sigh until its voice is echoless titan to thee the strife was given between the suffering and the will which torture where they can not kill and the inexorable heaven and the deaf tyranny of fate the ruling principle of hate which for its pleasure doth create the things it may annihilate refus 'd thee even the boon to die the wretched gift eternity was thine—and thou hast borne it well all that the thunderer wrung from thee was but the menace which flung back on him the torments of thy rack the fate thou didst so well foresee but would not to appease him tell and in thy silence was his sentence and in his soul a vain repentance and evil dread so ill dissembled that in his hand the lightnings trembled thy godlike crime was to be kind to render with thy precepts less the sum of human wretchedness and strengthen man with his own mind but baffled as thou wert from high still in thy patient energy in the endurance and repulse of thine impenetrable spirit which earth and heaven could not convulse a mighty lesson we inherit thou art a symbol and a sign to mortals of their fate and force like thee man is in part divine a troubled stream from a pure source and man in portions can foresee his own funereal destiny his wretchedness and his resistance and his sad unallied existence to which his spirit may oppose itself—and equal to all woes and a firm will and a deep sense which even in torture can descry its own concenter 'd recompense triumphant where it dares defy and making death a victory
when god at first made man having a glass of blessings standing by “ let us ” said he “ pour on him all we can let the world ’ s riches which dispersèd lie contract into a span. ” so strength first made a way then beauty flowed then wisdom honour pleasure when almost all was out god made a stay perceiving that alone of all his treasure rest in the bottom lay “ for if i should ” said he “ bestow this jewel also on my creature he would adore my gifts instead of me and rest in nature not the god of nature so both should losers be “ yet let him keep the rest but keep them with repining restlessness let him be rich and weary that at least if goodness lead him not yet weariness may toss him to my breast ”
the merry world did on a day with his train-bands and mates agree to meet together where i lay and all in sport to jeer at me first beauty crept into a rose which when i pluck 'd not `` sir '' said she '' tell me i pray whose hands are those '' but thou shalt answer lord for me then money came and chinking still '' what tune is this poor man '' said he '' i heard in music you had skill '' but thou shalt answer lord for me then came brave glory puffing by in silks that whistled who but he he scarce allow 'd me half an eye but thou shalt answer lord for me then came quick wit and conversation and he would needs a comfort be and to be short make an oration but thou shalt answer lord for me yet when the hour of thy design to answer these fine things shall come speak not at large say i am thine and then they have their answer home
grow old along with me the best is yet to be the last of life for which the first was made our times are in his hand who saith `` a whole i planned youth shows but half trust god see all nor be afraid '' not that amassing flowers youth sighed `` which rose make ours which lily leave and then as best recall '' not that admiring stars it yearned `` nor jove nor mars mine be some figured flame which blends transcends them all '' not for such hopes and fears annulling youth 's brief years do i remonstrate folly wide the mark rather i prize the doubt low kinds exist without finished and finite clods untroubled by a spark poor vaunt of life indeed were man but formed to feed on joy to solely seek and find and feast such feasting ended then as sure an end to men irks care the crop-full bird frets doubt the maw-crammed beast rejoice we are allied to that which doth provide and not partake effect and not receive a spark disturbs our clod nearer we hold of god who gives than of his tribes that take i must believe then welcome each rebuff that turns earth 's smoothness rough each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go be our joys three-parts pain strive and hold cheap the strain learn nor account the pang dare never grudge the throe for thence —a paradox which comforts while it mocks — shall life succeed in that it seems to fail what i aspired to be and was not comforts me a brute i might have been but would not sink i the scale what is he but a brute whose flesh has soul to suit whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play to man propose this test— thy body at its best how far can that project thy soul on its lone way yet gifts should prove their use i own the past profuse of power each side perfection every turn eyes ears took in their dole brain treasured up the whole should not the heart beat once `` how good to live and learn '' not once beat `` praise be thine i see the whole design i who saw power see now love perfect too perfect i call thy plan thanks that i was a man maker remake complete —i trust what thou shalt do '' for pleasant is this flesh our soul in its rose-mesh pulled ever to the earth still yearns for rest would we some prize might hold to match those manifold possessions of the brute —gain most as we did best let us not always say '' spite of this flesh to-day i strove made head gained ground upon the whole '' as the bird wings and sings let us cry `` all good things are ours nor soul helps flesh more now than flesh helps soul '' therefore i summon age to grant youth 's heritage life 's struggle having so far reached its term thence shall i pass approved a man for aye removed from the developed brute a god though in the germ and i shall thereupon take rest ere i be gone once more on my adventure brave and new fearless and unperplexed when i wage battle next what weapons to select what armour to indue youth ended i shall try my gain or loss thereby leave the fire ashes what survives is gold and i shall weigh the same give life its praise or blame young all lay in dispute i shall know being old for note when evening shuts a certain moment cuts the deed off calls the glory from the grey a whisper from the west shoots— '' add this to the rest take it and try its worth here dies another day '' so still within this life though lifted o'er its strife let me discern compare pronounce at last this rage was right i the main that acquiescence vain the future i may face now i have proved the past '' for more is not reserved to man with soul just nerved to act to-morrow what he learns to-day here work enough to watch the master work and catch hints of the proper craft tricks of the tool 's true play as it was better youth should strive through acts uncouth toward making than repose on aught found made so better age exempt from strife should know than tempt further thou waitedst age wait death nor be afraid enough now if the right and good and infinite be named here as thou callest thy hand thine own with knowledge absolute subject to no dispute from fools that crowded youth nor let thee feel alone be there for once and all severed great minds from small announced to each his station in the past was i the world arraigned were they my soul disdained right let age speak the truth and give us peace at last now who shall arbitrate ten men love what i hate shun what i follow slight what i receive ten who in ears and eyes match me we all surmise they this thing and i that whom shall my soul believe not on the vulgar mass called `` work '' must sentence pass things done that took the eye and had the price o'er which from level stand the low world laid its hand found straightway to its mind could value in a trice but all the world 's coarse thumb and finger failed to plumb so passed in making up the main account all instincts immature all purposes unsure that weighed not as his work yet swelled the man 's amount thoughts hardly to be packed into a narrow act fancies that broke through language and escaped all i could never be all men ignored in me this i was worth to god whose wheel the pitcher shaped ay note that potter 's wheel that metaphor and feel why time spins fast why passive lies our clay — thou to whom fools propound when the wine makes its round '' since life fleets all is change the past gone seize to-day '' fool all that is at all lasts ever past recall earth changes but thy soul and god stand sure what entered into thee that was is and shall be time 's wheel runs back or stops potter and clay endure he fixed thee mid this dance of plastic circumstance this present thou forsooth wouldst fain arrest machinery just meant to give thy soul its bent try thee and turn thee forth sufficiently impressed what though the earlier grooves which ran the laughing loves around thy base no longer pause and press what though about thy rim skull-things in order grim grow out in graver mood obey the sterner stress look not thou down but up to uses of a cup the festal board lamp 's flash and trumpet 's peal the new wine 's foaming flow the master 's lips a-glow thou heaven 's consummate cup what need'st thou with earth 's wheel but i need now as then thee god who mouldest men and since not even while the whirl was worst did i —to the wheel of life with shapes and colours rife bound dizzily —mistake my end to slake thy thirst so take and use thy work amend what flaws may lurk what strain o the stuff what warpings past the aim my times be in thy hand perfect the cup as planned let age approve of youth and death complete the same
the darkness draws me kindly angels weep forlorn beyond receding rings of light the torrents of the earth ’ s desires sweep my soul through twilight downward into night once more the light grows dim the vision fades myself seems to myself a distant goal i grope among the bodies ’ drowsy shades once more the old illusion rocks my soul once more the manifold in shadowy streams of falling waters murmurs in my ears the one voice drowns amid the roar of dreams that crowd the narrow pathway of the years i go to seek the starshine on the waves to count the dewdrops on the grassy hill i go to gather flowers that grow on graves the world ’ s wall closes round my prisoned will yea for the sake of the wild western wind the sphered spirit scorns her flame-built throne because of primroses time out of mind the lonely turns away from the alone who once has loved the cornfield ’ s rustling sheaves who once has heard the gentle irish rain murmur low music in the growing leaves though he were god comes back to earth again oh earth green wind-swept eirinn i would break the tower of my soul ’ s initiate pride for a gray field and a star-haunted lake and those wet winds that roam the country side i who have seen am glad to close my eyes i who have soared am weary of my wings i seek no more the secret of the wise safe among shadowy unreal human things blind to the gleam of those wild violet rays that burn beyond the rainbow 's circle dim bound by dark nights and driven by pale days the sightless slave of time ’ s imperious whim deaf to the flowing tide of dreams divine that surge outside the closed gates of birth the rhythms of eternity too fine to touch with music the dull ears of earth— i go to seek with humble care and toil the dreams i left undreamed the deeds undone to sow the seed and break the stubborn soil knowing no brightness whiter than the sun content in winter if the fire burns clear and cottage walls keep out the creeping damp hugging the old illusion warm and dear the silence and the wise book and the lamp
the smashed weirdness of the raving cadenzas of god takes over all of a sudden in our time it speaks through the voices of talk show moderators it tells us in a ringing anthem like heavenly hosts uplifted that the rhapsody of the pastoral is out to lunch we can take it from there we can take it to easy street but when things get tough on easy street what then is it time for realism and who are these guys on the bus who glide in golden hats past us on their way to kansas city
my life is vile i hate it so i ’ ll wait awhile and then i ’ ll go why wait at all hope springs alive good may befall i yet may thrive it is because i can ’ t make up my mind if god is good impotent or unkind

when my grave is broke up again some second guest to entertain for graves have learn 'd that woman head to be to more than one a bed and he that digs it spies a bracelet of bright hair about the bone will he not let'us alone and think that there a loving couple lies who thought that this device might be some way to make their souls at the last busy day meet at this grave and make a little stay if this fall in a time or land where mis-devotion doth command then he that digs us up will bring us to the bishop and the king to make us relics then thou shalt be a mary magdalen and i a something else thereby all women shall adore us and some men and since at such time miracles are sought i would have that age by this paper taught what miracles we harmless lovers wrought first we lov 'd well and faithfully yet knew not what we lov 'd nor why difference of sex no more we knew than our guardian angels do coming and going we perchance might kiss but not between those meals our hands ne'er touch 'd the seals which nature injur 'd by late law sets free these miracles we did but now alas all measure and all language i should pass should i tell what a miracle she was
yes thou art gone and never more thy sunny smile shall gladden me but i may pass the old church door and pace the floor that covers thee may stand upon the cold damp stone and think that frozen lies below the lightest heart that i have known the kindest i shall ever know yet though i can not see thee more 'tis still a comfort to have seen and though thy transient life is o'er 'tis sweet to think that thou hast been to think a soul so near divine within a form so angel fair united to a heart like thine has gladdened once our humble sphere
all the sioux were defeated our clan got poor but a few got richer they fought two wars i did not take part no one remembers your vision or even your real name now the children go to town and like loud music i married a christian crazy horse it is not fair to hide a new vision from you in our schools we are learning to take aim when we talk and we have found out our enemies they shift when words do they even change and hide in every person a teacher here says hurt or scorned people are places where real enemies hide he says we should not hurt or scorn anyone but help them and i will tell you in a brave way the way crazy horse talked that teacher is right i will tell you a strange thing at the rodeo close to the grandstand i saw a farm lady scared by a blown piece of paper and at that place horses and policemen were no longer frightening but suffering faces were and the hunched-over backs of the old crazy horse tell me if i am right these are the things we thought we were doing something about in your life you saw many strange things and i will tell you another now i salute the white man ’ s flag but when i salute i hold my hand alertly on the heartbeat and remember all of us and how we depend on a steady pulse together there are those who salute because they fear other flags or mean to use ours to chase them i must not allow my part of saluting to mean this all of our promises our generous sayings to each other our honorable intentions—those i affirm when i salute at these times it is like shutting my eyes and joining a religious colony at prayer in the gray dawn in the deep aisles of a church now i have told you about new times yes i know others will report different things they have been caught by weak ways i tell you straight the way it is now and it is our way the way we were trying to find the chokecherries along our valley still bear a bright fruit there is good pottery clay north of here i remember our old places when i pass the musselshell i run my hand along those old grooves in the rock
twelve o'clock along the reaches of the street held in a lunar synthesis whispering lunar incantations dissolve the floors of memory and all its clear relations its divisions and precisions every street lamp that i pass beats like a fatalistic drum and through the spaces of the dark midnight shakes the memory as a madman shakes a dead geranium half-past one the street lamp sputtered the street lamp muttered the street lamp said `` regard that woman who hesitates towards you in the light of the door which opens on her like a grin you see the border of her dress is torn and stained with sand and you see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin '' the memory throws up high and dry a crowd of twisted things a twisted branch upon the beach eaten smooth and polished as if the world gave up the secret of its skeleton stiff and white a broken spring in a factory yard rust that clings to the form that the strength has left hard and curled and ready to snap half-past two the street lamp said '' remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter slips out its tongue and devours a morsel of rancid butter '' so the hand of a child automatic slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay i could see nothing behind that child 's eye i have seen eyes in the street trying to peer through lighted shutters and a crab one afternoon in a pool an old crab with barnacles on his back gripped the end of a stick which i held him half-past three the lamp sputtered the lamp muttered in the dark the lamp hummed '' regard the moon la lune ne garde aucune rancune she winks a feeble eye she smiles into corners she smoothes the hair of the grass the moon has lost her memory a washed-out smallpox cracks her face her hand twists a paper rose that smells of dust and old cologne she is alone with all the old nocturnal smells that cross and cross across her brain '' the reminiscence comes of sunless dry geraniums and dust in crevices smells of chestnuts in the streets and female smells in shuttered rooms and cigarettes in corridors and cocktail smells in bars '' the lamp said '' four o'clock here is the number on the door memory you have the key the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair mount the bed is open the tooth-brush hangs on the wall put your shoes at the door sleep prepare for life '' the last twist of the knife
coldly sadly descends the autumn-evening the field strewn with its dank yellow drifts of wither 'd leaves and the elms fade into dimness apace silent —hardly a shout from a few boys late at their play the lights come out in the street in the school-room windows —but cold solemn unlighted austere through the gathering darkness arise the chapel-walls in whose bound thou my father art laid there thou dost lie in the gloom of the autumn evening but ah that word gloom to my mind brings thee back in the light of thy radiant vigour again in the gloom of november we pass'd days not dark at thy side seasons impair 'd not the ray of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear such thou wast and i stand in the autumn evening and think of bygone autumns with thee fifteen years have gone round since thou arosest to tread in the summer-morning the road of death at a call unforeseen sudden for fifteen years we who till then in thy shade rested as under the boughs of a mighty oak have endured sunshine and rain as we might bare unshaded alone lacking the shelter of thee o strong soul by what shore tarriest thou now for that force surely has not been left vain somewhere surely afar in the sounding labour-house vast of being is practised that strength zealous beneficent firm yes in some far-shining sphere conscious or not of the past still thou performest the word of the spirit in whom thou dost live— prompt unwearied as here still thou upraisest with zeal the humble good from the ground sternly repressest the bad still like a trumpet dost rouse those who with half-open eyes tread the border-land dim 'twixt vice and virtue reviv'st succourest —this was thy work this was thy life upon earth what is the course of the life of mortal men on the earth — most men eddy about here and there—eat and drink chatter and love and hate gather and squander are raised aloft are hurl 'd in the dust striving blindly achieving nothing and then they die— perish —and no one asks who or what they have been more than he asks what waves in the moonlit solitudes mild of the midmost ocean have swell 'd foam 'd for a moment and gone and there are some whom a thirst ardent unquenchable fires not with the crowd to be spent not without aim to go round in an eddy of purposeless dust effort unmeaning and vain ah yes some of us strive not without action to die fruitless but something to snatch from dull oblivion nor all glut the devouring grave we we have chosen our path— path to a clear-purposed goal path of advance —but it leads a long steep journey through sunk gorges o'er mountains in snow cheerful with friends we set forth— then on the height comes the storm thunder crashes from rock to rock the cataracts reply lightnings dazzle our eyes roaring torrents have breach'd the track the stream-bed descends in the place where the wayfarer once planted his footstep—the spray boils o'er its borders aloft the unseen snow-beds dislodge their hanging ruin alas havoc is made in our train friends who set forth at our side falter are lost in the storm we we only are left with frowning foreheads with lips sternly compress 'd we strain on on—and at nightfall at last come to the end of our way to the lonely inn 'mid the rocks where the gaunt and taciturn host stands on the threshold the wind shaking his thin white hairs— holds his lantern to scan our storm-beat figures and asks whom in our party we bring whom we have left in the snow sadly we answer we bring only ourselves we lost sight of the rest in the storm hardly ourselves we fought through stripp 'd without friends as we are friends companions and train the avalanche swept from our side but thou woulds't not alone be saved my father alone conquer and come to thy goal leaving the rest in the wild we were weary and we fearful and we in our march fain to drop down and to die still thou turnedst and still beckonedst the trembler and still gavest the weary thy hand if in the paths of the world stones might have wounded thy feet toil or dejection have tried thy spirit of that we saw nothing—to us thou wage still cheerful and helpful and firm therefore to thee it was given many to save with thyself and at the end of thy day o faithful shepherd to come bringing thy sheep in thy hand and through thee i believe in the noble and great who are gone pure souls honour 'd and blest by former ages who else— such so soulless so poor is the race of men whom i see— seem 'd but a dream of the heart seem 'd but a cry of desire yes i believe that there lived others like thee in the past not like the men of the crowd who all round me to-day bluster or cringe and make life hideous and arid and vile but souls temper 'd with fire fervent heroic and good helpers and friends of mankind servants of god —or sons shall i not call you because not as servants ye knew your father 's innermost mind his who unwillingly sees one of his little ones lost— yours is the praise if mankind hath not as yet in its march fainted and fallen and died see in the rocks of the world marches the host of mankind a feeble wavering line where are they tending —a god marshall 'd them gave them their goal ah but the way is so long years they have been in the wild sore thirst plagues them the rocks rising all round overawe factions divide them their host threatens to break to dissolve —ah keep keep them combined else of the myriads who fill that army not one shall arrive sole they shall stray in the rocks stagger for ever in vain die one by one in the waste then in such hour of need of your fainting dispirited race ye like angels appear radiant with ardour divine beacons of hope ye appear languor is not in your heart weakness is not in your word weariness not on your brow ye alight in our van at your voice panic despair flee away ye move through the ranks recall the stragglers refresh the outworn praise re-inspire the brave order courage return eyes rekindling and prayers follow your steps as ye go ye fill up the gaps in our files strengthen the wavering line stablish continue our march on to the bound of the waste on to the city of god
the bud stands for all things even for those things that don ’ t flower for everything flowers from within of self-blessing though sometimes it is necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness to put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words and in touch it is lovely until it flowers again from within of self-blessing as saint francis put his hand on the creased forehead of the sow and told her in words and in touch blessings of earth on the sow and the sow began remembering all down her thick length from the earthen snout all the way through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine down through the great broken heart to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them the long perfect loveliness of sow

turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon can not hear the falconer things fall apart the centre can not hold mere anarchy is loosed upon the world the blood-dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity surely some revelation is at hand surely the second coming is at hand the second coming hardly are those words out when a vast image out of spiritus mundi troubles my sight somewhere in sands of the desert a shape with lion body and the head of a man a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun is moving its slow thighs while all about it reel shadows of the indignant desert birds the darkness drops again but now i know that twenty centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle and what rough beast its hour come round at last slouches towards bethlehem to be born
i thought i was growing wings— it was a cocoon i thought now is the time to step into the fire— it was deep water eschatology is a word i learned as a child the study of last things facing my mirror—no longer young the news—always of death the dogs—rising from sleep and clamoring and howling howling nevertheless i see for a moment that 's not it it is the first things word after word floats through the glass towards me

i like it quiet like this alton i like to think i love the way spring light falls easy soft this morning i was driving the cruiser savoring gold pollen everywhere out in the south of the county real nice seeing forsythia and daffodils ditch irises and a few cherokee roses opening white it was a blue day and i had a tampa jewel just counting cows seeing an april breeze in the catkins and new leaves the radio off i know that ’ s hardly right but curse any citizen who ’ d grudge me an hour ’ s peace then i started seeing this marksmanship in the caution signs the yellow diamonds that warn of deer or curves ahead a steep grade—there ’ s one of those four circles and a jagged hole likely a thirty-eight slug smack in the center neater than willard cleaves meat at the joint a dozen and more i got mad because i get paid to protect what the county commission declares holy— the park with its petting zoo the rebel sentry on the square and all the highway signs— and here ’ s all indications that some felon has no respect some felon who can shoot i admit my feelings were mixed that right indignation at the broken law but envy of his eye for centers mind you i saw nary a rip on the fringes or a near miss bull ’ s-eyes every sign i saw a fool is what i feel you understand cause i motored over to pig burton ’ s store near the bottle and asked him—he was stacking feed sacks on robert ring ’ s vehicle— who the hell was the target king of beat three pig always has his hands in every pie he ’ d know if some individual had been hauling off all the turkey shoot prizes i know i should know too but a sheriff ’ s got beaucoup chores to do mostly idiot paperwork i ’ ve lost touch since the last bond vote hired me four new deputies all dirt-dumb well old pig has that laugh he can ’ t hold back and he points his finger pistol-like at robert who ’ s got a shamed look on his face “ pow ” he says at me or bob looking back and forth just “ pow. ” seems bob ’ s boy earl the one that ain ’ t got the sense of a chicken under that cowlick red as a rooster comb is known to have sneaked bob ’ s colt a week before and shot every yellow sign he could till his pa ran him down and whacked him good then locked him in the fall-down curing shed overnight—he ’ s a hard man but he loves that boy i remember once ... but how the hell can any half-wit you wouldn ’ t trust to milk hit the bull by the eye first time he ever gets loose with a handgun “ it ’ s easy ” says bob less shamed than afraid now he ’ ll have to pay for fresh metal—his people have always been tight—but he ’ s showing a grin i don ’ t like “ real easy he just cuts loose from the hip five short feet back sometimes maybe six and comes back later to paint the target circles wheresomever his bullet hits he aims that paintbrush right smart. ” blessed if i don ’ t feel the fool for being full dumbstruck at a trick earl ’ s not bright enough to see as a joke but i didn ’ t write it up nor charge a soul just ground my cigar in the dirt and helped myself to a dr. pepper made believe it didn ’ t mean a thing but all day i ’ ve been riding listening to crime reports on state radio— robbery at the mall attempted rape maybe wrecks on the bypass and a set fire in brill ’ s deer woods it gets to be too much i shouldn ’ t even take the time to sit here watching this dark space where folks have been dancing all evening hearing the quiet after all those raucous songs but alton don ’ t you see the feeble boy ’ s right or half right at least it all comes to the same whether you get what you want in the end or want what you get the law works that way each law makes more crime but it ’ s not my job to say warm up my cup just one last time i ’ ve got to circle ampex once more before i turn it home god this dark feels right no matter what flowers out there shed spring light the dark is what hits me as holy i ’ m calling it a day catch you later night

an episode and the first grey of morning fill 'd the east and the fog rose out of the oxus stream but all the tartar camp along the stream was hush 'd and still the men were plunged in sleep sohrab alone he slept not all night long he had lain wakeful tossing on his bed but when the grey dawn stole into his tent he rose and clad himself and girt his sword and took his horseman 's cloak and left his tent and went abroad into the cold wet fog through the dim camp to peran-wisa 's tent through the black tartar tents he pass 'd which stood clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand of oxus where the summer-floods o'erflow when the sun melts the snows in high pamere through the black tents he pass 'd o'er that low strand and to a hillock came a little back from the stream 's brink—the spot where first a boat crossing the stream in summer scrapes the land the men of former times had crown 'd the top with a clay fort but that was fall'n and now the tartars built there peran-wisa 's tent a dome of laths and o'er it felts were spread and sohrab came there and went in and stood upon the thick piled carpets in the tent and found the old man sleeping on his bed of rugs and felts and near him lay his arms and peran-wisa heard him though the step was dull 'd for he slept light an old man 's sleep and he rose quickly on one arm and said — '' who art thou for it is not yet clear dawn speak is there news or any night alarm '' but sohrab came to the bedside and said — '' thou know'st me peran-wisa it is i. the sun is not yet risen and the foe sleep but i sleep not all night long i lie tossing and wakeful and i come to thee for so did king afrasiab bid me seek thy counsel and to heed thee as thy son in samarcand before the army march 'd and i will tell thee what my heart desires thou know'st if since from ader-baijan first i came among the tartars and bore arms i have still served afrasiab well and shown at my boy 's years the courage of a man this too thou know'st that while i still bear on the conquering tartar ensigns through the world and beat the persians back on every field i seek one man one man and one alone— rustum my father who i hoped should greet should one day greet upon some well-fought field his not unworthy not inglorious son so i long hoped but him i never find come then hear now and grant me what i ask let the two armies rest to-day but i will challenge forth the bravest persian lords to meet me man to man if i prevail rustum will surely hear it if i fall— old man the dead need no one claim no kin dim is the rumour of a common fight where host meets host and many names are sunk but of a single combat fame speaks clear '' he spoke and peran-wisa took the hand of the young man in his and sigh 'd and said — '' o sohrab an unquiet heart is thine canst thou not rest among the tartar chiefs and share the battle 's common chance with us who love thee but must press for ever first in single fight incurring single risk to find a father thou hast never seen that were far best my son to stay with us unmurmuring in our tents while it is war and when 't is truce then in afrasiab 's towns but if this one desire indeed rules all to seek out rustum—seek him not through fight seek him in peace and carry to his arms o sohrab carry an unwounded son but far hence seek him for he is not here for now it is not as when i was young when rustum was in front of every fray but now he keeps apart and sits at home in seistan with zal his father old whether that his own mighty strength at last feels the abhorr 'd approaches of old age or in some quarrel with the persian king there go —thou wilt not yet my heart forebodes danger or death awaits thee on this field fain would i know thee safe and well though lost to us fain therefore send thee hence in peace to seek thy father not seek single fights in vain —but who can keep the lion 's cub from ravening and who govern rustum 's son go i will grant thee what thy heart desires '' so said he and dropp 'd sohrab 's hand and left his bed and the warm rugs whereon he lay and o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat he pass 'd and tied his sandals on his feet and threw a white cloak round him and he took in his right hand a ruler 's staff no sword and on his head he set his sheep-skin cap black glossy curl 'd the fleece of kara-kul and raised the curtain of his tent and call'd his herald to his side and went abroad the sun by this had risen and clear 'd the fog from the broad oxus and the glittering sands and from their tents the tartar horsemen filed into the open plain so haman bade— haman who next to peran-wisa ruled the host and still was in his lusty prime from their black tents long files of horse they stream 'd as when some grey november morn the files in marching order spread of long-neck 'd cranes stream over casbin and the southern slopes of elburz from the aralian estuaries or some frore caspian reed-bed southward bound for the warm persian sea-board—so they stream 'd the tartars of the oxus the king 's guard first with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears large men large steeds who from bokhara come and khiva and ferment the milk of mares next the more temperate toorkmuns of the south the tukas and the lances of salore and those from attruck and the caspian sands light men and on light steeds who only drink the acrid milk of camels and their wells and then a swarm of wandering horse who came from far and a more doubtful service own 'd the tartars of ferghana from the banks of the jaxartes men with scanty beards and close-set skull-caps and those wilder hordes who roam o'er kipchak and the northern waste kalmucks and unkempt kuzzaks tribes who stray nearest the pole and wandering kirghizzes who come on shaggy ponies from pamere these all filed out from camp into the plain and on the other side the persians form 'd — first a light cloud of horse tartars they seem 'd the ilyats of khorassan and behind the royal troops of persia horse and foot marshall 'd battalions bright in burnish 'd steel but peran-wisa with his herald came threading the tartar squadrons to the front and with his staff kept back the foremost ranks and when ferood who led the persians saw that peran-wisa kept the tartars back he took his spear and to the front he came and check 'd his ranks and fix 'd them where they stood and the old tartar came upon the sand betwixt the silent hosts and spake and said — '' ferood and ye persians and tartars hear let there be truce between the hosts to-day but choose a champion from the persian lords to fight our champion sohrab man to man '' as in the country on a morn in june when the dew glistens on the pearled ears a shiver runs through the deep corn for joy— so when they heard what peran-wisa said a thrill through all the tartar squadrons ran of pride and hope for sohrab whom they loved but as a troop of pedlars from cabool cross underneath the indian caucasus that vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow crossing so high that as they mount they pass long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow choked by the air and scarce can they themselves slake their parch 'd throats with sugar 'd mulberries— in single file they move and stop their breath for fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows— so the pale persians held their breath with fear and to ferood his brother chiefs came up to counsel gudurz and zoarrah came and feraburz who ruled the persian host second and was the uncle of the king these came and counsell 'd and then gudurz said — '' ferood shame bids us take their challenge up yet champion have we none to match this youth he has the wild stag 's foot the lion 's heart but rustum came last night aloof he sits and sullen and has pitch 'd his tents apart him will i seek and carry to his ear the tartar challenge and this young man 's name haply he will forget his wrath and fight stand forth the while and take their challenge up '' so spake he and ferood stood forth and cried — '' old man be it agreed as thou hast said let sohrab arm and we will find a man '' he spake and peran-wisa turn 'd and strode back through the opening squadrons to his tent but through the anxious persians gudurz ran and cross 'd the camp which lay behind and reach 'd out on the sands beyond it rustum 's tents of scarlet cloth they were and glittering gay just pitch 'd the high pavilion in the midst was rustum 's and his men lay camp 'd around and gudurz enter 'd rustum 's tent and found rustum his morning meal was done but still the table stood before him charged with food— a side of roasted sheep and cakes of bread and dark green melons and there rustum sate listless and held a falcon on his wrist and play 'd with it but gudurz came and stood before him and he look 'd and saw him stand and with a cry sprang up and dropp 'd the bird and greeted gudurz with both hands and said — '' welcome these eyes could see no better sight what news but sit down first and eat and drink '' but gudurz stood in the tent-door and said — '' not now a time will come to eat and drink but not to-day to-day has other needs the armies are drawn out and stand at gaze for from the tartars is a challenge brought to pick a champion from the persian lords to fight their champion—and thou know'st his name— sohrab men call him but his birth is hid o rustum like thy might is this young man 's he has the wild stag 's foot the lion 's heart and he is young and iran 's chiefs are old or else too weak and all eyes turn to thee come down and help us rustum or we lose '' he spoke but rustum answer 'd with a smile — '' go to if iran 's chiefs are old then i am older if the young are weak the king errs strangely for the king for kai khosroo himself is young and honours younger men and lets the aged moulder to their graves rustum he loves no more but loves the young— the young may rise at sohrab 's vaunts not i. for what care i though all speak sohrab 's fame for would that i myself had such a son and not that one slight helpless girl i have— a son so famed so brave to send to war and i to tarry with the snow-hair 'd zal my father whom the robber afghans vex and clip his borders short and drive his herds and he has none to guard his weak old age there would i go and hang my armour up and with my great name fence that weak old man and spend the goodly treasures i have got and rest my age and hear of sohrab 's fame and leave to death the hosts of thankless kings and with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more '' he spoke and smiled and gudurz made reply — '' what then o rustum will men say to this when sohrab dares our bravest forth and seeks thee most of all and thou whom most he seeks hidest thy face take heed lest men should say like some old miser rustum hoards his fame and shuns to peril it with younger men '' and greatly moved then rustum made reply — '' o gudurz wherefore dost thou say such words thou knowest better words than this to say what is one more one less obscure or famed valiant or craven young or old to me are not they mortal am not i myself but who for men of nought would do great deeds come thou shalt see how rustum hoards his fame but i will fight unknown and in plain arms let not men say of rustum he was match'd in single fight with any mortal man '' he spoke and frown 'd and gudurz turn 'd and ran back quickly through the camp in fear and joy— fear at his wrath but joy that rustum came but rustum strode to his tent-door and call'd his followers in and bade them bring his arms and clad himself in steel the arms he chose were plain and on his shield was no device only his helm was rich inlaid with gold and from the fluted spine atop a plume of horsehair waved a scarlet horsehair plume so arm 'd he issued forth and ruksh his horse follow 'd him like a faithful hound at heel— ruksh whose renown was noised through all the earth the horse whom rustum on a foray once did in bokhara by the river find a colt beneath its dam and drove him home and rear 'd him a bright bay with lofty crest dight with a saddle-cloth of broider 'd green crusted with gold and on the ground were work'd all beasts of chase all beasts which hunters know so follow 'd rustum left his tents and cross'd the camp and to the persian host appear 'd and all the persians knew him and with shouts hail 'd but the tartars knew not who he was and dear as the wet diver to the eyes of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore by sandy bahrein in the persian gulf plunging all day in the blue waves at night having made up his tale of precious pearls rejoins her in their hut upon the sands— so dear to the pale persians rustum came and rustum to the persian front advanced and sohrab arm 'd in haman 's tent and came and as afield the reapers cut a swath down through the middle of a rich man 's corn and on each side are squares of standing corn and in the midst a stubble short and bare— so on each side were squares of men with spears bristling and in the midst the open sand and rustum came upon the sand and cast his eyes toward the tartar tents and saw sohrab come forth and eyed him as he came as some rich woman on a winter 's morn eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge who with numb blacken 'd fingers makes her fire— at cock-crow on a starlit winter 's morn when the frost flowers the whiten 'd window-panes— and wonders how she lives and what the thoughts of that poor drudge may be so rustum eyed the unknown adventurous youth who from afar came seeking rustum and defying forth all the most valiant chiefs long he perused his spirited air and wonder 'd who he was for very young he seem 'd tenderly rear 'd like some young cypress tall and dark and straight which in a queen 's secluded garden throws its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf by midnight to a bubbling fountain 's sound— so slender sohrab seem 'd so softly rear 'd and a deep pity enter 'd rustum 's soul as he beheld him coming and he stood and beckon 'd to him with his hand and said — '' o thou young man the air of heaven is soft and warm and pleasant but the grave is cold heaven 's air is better than the cold dead grave behold me i am vast and clad in iron and tried and i have stood on many a field of blood and i have fought with many a foe— never was that field lost or that foe saved o sohrab wherefore wilt thou rush on death be govern 'd quit the tartar host and come to iran and be as my son to me and fight beneath my banner till i die there are no youths in iran brave as thou '' so he spake mildly sohrab heard his voice the mighty voice of rustum and he saw his giant figure planted on the sand sole like some single tower which a chief hath builded on the waste in former years against the robbers and he saw that head streak 'd with its first grey hairs —hope filled his soul and he ran forward and embraced his knees and clasp 'd his hand within his own and said — '' o by thy father 's head by thine own soul art thou not rustum speak art thou not he '' but rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth and turn 'd away and spake to his own soul — '' ah me i muse what this young fox may mean false wily boastful are these tartar boys for if i now confess this thing he asks and hide it not but say rustum is here he will not yield indeed nor quit our foes but he will find some pretext not to fight and praise my fame and proffer courteous gifts a belt or sword perhaps and go his way and on a feast-tide in afrasiab 's hall in samarcand he will arise and cry 'i challenged once when the two armies camp'd beside the oxus all the persian lords to cope with me in single fight but they shrank only rustum dared then he and i changed gifts and went on equal terms away so will he speak perhaps while men applaud then were the chiefs of iran shamed through me '' and then he turn 'd and sternly spake aloud — '' rise wherefore dost thou vainly question thus of rustum i am here whom thou hast call'd by challenge forth make good thy vaunt or yield is it with rustum only thou wouldst fight rash boy men look on rustum 's face and flee for well i know that did great rustum stand before thy face this day and were reveal 'd there would be then no talk of fighting more but being what i am i tell thee this— do thou record it in thine inmost soul either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield or else thy bones shall strew this sand till winds bleach them or oxus with his summer-floods oxus in summer wash them all away '' he spoke and sohrab answer 'd on his feet — '' art thou so fierce thou wilt not fright me so i am no girl to be made pale by words yet this thou hast said well did rustum stand here on this field there were no fighting then but rustum is far hence and we stand here begin thou art more vast more dread than i and thou art proved i know and i am young— but yet success sways with the breath of heaven and though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure thy victory yet thou canst not surely know for we are all like swimmers in the sea poised on the top of a huge wave of fate which hangs uncertain to which side to fall and whether it will heave us up to land or whether it will roll us out to sea back out to sea to the deep waves of death we know not and no search will make us know only the event will teach us in its hour '' he spoke and rustum answer 'd not but hurl'd his spear down from the shoulder down it came as on some partridge in the corn a hawk that long has tower 'd in the airy clouds drops like a plummet sohrab saw it come and sprang aside quick as a flash the spear hiss 'd and went quivering down into the sand which it sent flying wide —then sohrab threw in turn and full struck rustum 's shield sharp rang the iron plates rang sharp but turn 'd the spear and rustum seized his club which none but he could wield an unlopp 'd trunk it was and huge still rough—like those which men in treeless plains to build them boats fish from the flooded rivers hyphasis or hydaspes when high up by their dark springs the wind in winter-time hath made in himalayan forests wrack and strewn the channels with torn boughs—so huge the club which rustum lifted now and struck one stroke but again sohrab sprang aside lithe as the glancing snake and the club came thundering to earth and leapt from rustum 's hand and rustum follow 'd his own blow and fell to his knees and with his fingers clutch 'd the sand and now might sohrab have unsheathed his sword and pierced the mighty rustum while he lay dizzy and on his knees and choked with sand but he look 'd on and smiled nor bared his sword but courteously drew back and spoke and said — '' thou strik'st too hard that club of thine will float upon the summer-floods and not my bones but rise and be not wroth not wroth am i no when i see thee wrath forsakes my soul thou say'st thou art not rustum be it so who art thou then that canst so touch my soul boy as i am i have seen battles too— have waded foremost in their bloody waves and heard their hollow roar of dying men but never was my heart thus touch 'd before are they from heaven these softenings of the heart o thou old warrior let us yield to heaven come plant we here in earth our angry spears and make a truce and sit upon this sand and pledge each other in red wine like friends and thou shalt talk to me of rustum 's deeds there are enough foes in the persian host whom i may meet and strike and feel no pang champions enough afrasiab has whom thou mayst fight fight them when they confront thy spear but oh let there be peace 'twixt thee and me '' he ceased but while he spake rustum had risen and stood erect trembling with rage his club he left to lie but had regain 'd his spear whose fiery point now in his mail 'd right-hand blazed bright and baleful like that autumn-star the baleful sign of fevers dust had soil'd his stately crest and dimm 'd his glittering arms his breast heaved his lips foam 'd and twice his voice was choked with rage at last these words broke way — '' girl nimble with thy feet not with thy hands curl 'd minion dancer coiner of sweet words fight let me hear thy hateful voice no more thou art not in afrasiab 's gardens now with tartar girls with whom thou art wont to dance but on the oxus-sands and in the dance of battle and with me who make no play of war i fight it out and hand to hand speak not to me of truce and pledge and wine remember all thy valour try thy feints and cunning all the pity i had is gone because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts with thy light skipping tricks and thy girl 's wiles '' he spoke and sohrab kindled at his taunts and he too drew his sword at once they rush'd together as two eagles on one prey come rushing down together from the clouds one from the east one from the west their shields dash 'd with a clang together and a din rose such as that the sinewy woodcutters make often in the forest 's heart at morn of hewing axes crashing trees—such blows rustum and sohrab on each other hail 'd and you would say that sun and stars took part in that unnatural conflict for a cloud grew suddenly in heaven and dark 'd the sun over the fighters heads and a wind rose under their feet and moaning swept the plain and in a sandy whirlwind wrapp 'd the pair in gloom they twain were wrapp 'd and they alone for both the on-looking hosts on either hand stood in broad daylight and the sky was pure and the sun sparkled on the oxus stream but in the gloom they fought with bloodshot eyes and labouring breath first rustum struck the shield which sohrab held stiff out the steel-spiked spear rent the tough plates but fail 'd to reach the skin and rustum pluck 'd it back with angry groan then sohrab with his sword smote rustum 's helm nor clove its steel quite through but all the crest he shore away and that proud horsehair plume never till now defiled sank to the dust and rustum bow 'd his head but then the gloom grew blacker thunder rumbled in the air and lightnings rent the cloud and ruksh the horse who stood at hand utter 'd a dreadful cry — no horse 's cry was that most like the roar of some pain 'd desert-lion who all day hath trail 'd the hunter 's javelin in his side and comes at night to die upon the sand the two hosts heard that cry and quaked for fear and oxus curdled as it cross 'd his stream but sohrab heard and quail 'd not but rush 'd on and struck again and again rustum bow'd his head but this time all the blade like glass sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm and in the hand the hilt remain 'd alone then rustum raised his head his dreadful eyes glared and he shook on high his menacing spear and shouted rustum —sohrab heard that shout and shrank amazed back he recoil 'd one step and scann 'd with blinking eyes the advancing form and then he stood bewilder 'd and he dropp'd his covering shield and the spear pierced his side he reel 'd and staggering back sank to the ground and then the gloom dispersed and the wind fell and the bright sun broke forth and melted all the cloud and the two armies saw the pair— saw rustum standing safe upon his feet and sohrab wounded on the bloody sand then with a bitter smile rustum began — '' sohrab thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill a persian lord this day and strip his corpse and bear thy trophies to afrasiab 's tent or else that the great rustum would come down himself to fight and that thy wiles would move his heart to take a gift and let thee go and then that all the tartar host would praise thy courage or thy craft and spread thy fame to glad thy father in his weak old age fool thou art slain and by an unknown man dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be than to thy friends and to thy father old '' and with a fearless mien sohrab replied — '' unknown thou art yet thy fierce vaunt is vain thou dost not slay me proud and boastful man no rustum slays me and this filial heart for were i match 'd with ten such men as thee and i were that which till to-day i was they should be lying here i standing there but that belovéd name unnerved my arm— that name and something i confess in thee which troubles all my heart and made my shield fall and thy spear transfix 'd an unarm 'd foe and now thou boastest and insult'st my fate but hear thou this fierce man tremble to hear the mighty rustum shall avenge my death my father whom i seek through all the world he shall avenge my death and punish thee '' as when some hunter in the spring hath found a breeding eagle sitting on her nest upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake and pierced her with an arrow as she rose and follow 'd her to find her where she fell far off —anon her mate comes winging back from hunting and a great way off descries his huddling young left sole at that he checks his pinion and with short uneasy sweeps circles above his eyry with loud screams chiding his mate back to her nest but she lies dying with the arrow in her side in some far stony gorge out of his ken a heap of fluttering feathers—never more shall the lake glass her flying over it never the black and dripping precipices echo her stormy scream as she sails by— as that poor bird flies home nor knows his loss so rustum knew not his own loss but stood over his dying son and knew him not but with a cold incredulous voice he said — '' what prate is this of fathers and revenge the mighty rustum never had a son '' and with a failing voice sohrab replied — '' ah yes he had and that lost son am i. surely the news will one day reach his ear reach rustum where he sits and tarries long somewhere i know not where but far from here and pierce him like a stab and make him leap to arms and cry for vengeance upon thee fierce man bethink thee for an only son what will that grief what will that vengeance be oh could i live till i that grief had seen yet him i pity not so much but her my mother who in ader-baijan dwells with that old king her father who grows grey with age and rules over the valiant koords her most i pity who no more will see sohrab returning from the tartar camp with spoils and honour when the war is done but a dark rumour will be bruited up from tribe to tribe until it reach her ear and then will that defenceless woman learn that sohrab will rejoice her sight no more but that in battle with a nameless foe by the far-distant oxus he is slain '' he spoke and as he ceased he wept aloud thinking of her he left and his own death he spoke but rustum listen 'd plunged in thought nor did he yet believe it was his son who spoke although he call 'd back names he knew for he had had sure tidings that the babe which was in ader-baijan born to him had been a puny girl no boy at all— so that sad mother sent him word for fear rustum should seek the boy to train in arms and so he deem 'd that either sohrab took by a false boast the style of rustum 's son or that men gave it him to swell his fame so deem 'd he yet he listen 'd plunged in thought and his soul set to grief as the vast tide of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore at the full moon tears gather 'd in his eyes for he remember 'd his own early youth and all its bounding rapture as at dawn the shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries a far bright city smitten by the sun through many rolling clouds—so rustum saw his youth saw sohrab 's mother in her bloom and that old king her father who loved well his wandering guest and gave him his fair child with joy and all the pleasant life they led they three in that long-distant summer-time— the castle and the dewy woods and hunt and hound and morn on those delightful hills in ader-baijan and he saw that youth of age and looks to be his own dear son piteous and lovely lying on the sand like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe of an unskilful gardener has been cut mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed and lies a fragrant tower of purple bloom on the mown dying grass—so sohrab lay lovely in death upon the common sand and rustum gazed on him with grief and said — '' o sohrab thou indeed art such a son whom rustum wert thou his might well have loved yet here thou errest sohrab or else men have told thee false—thou art not rustum 's son for rustum had no son one child he had— but one—a girl who with her mother now plies some light female task nor dreams of us— of us she dreams not nor of wounds nor war '' but sohrab answer 'd him in wrath for now the anguish of the deep-fix 'd spear grew fierce and he desired to draw forth the steel and let the blood flow free and so to die— but first he would convince his stubborn foe and rising sternly on one arm he said — '' man who art thou who dost deny my words truth sits upon the lips of dying men and falsehood while i lived was far from mine i tell thee prick 'd upon this arm i bear that seal which rustum to my mother gave that she might prick it on the babe she bore '' he spoke and all the blood left rustum 's cheeks and his knees totter 'd and he smote his hand against his breast his heavy mailed hand that the hard iron corslet clank 'd aloud and to his heart he press 'd the other hand and in a hollow voice he spake and said — '' sohrab that were a proof which could not lie if thou show this then art thou rustum 's son '' then with weak hasty fingers sohrab loosed his belt and near the shoulder bared his arm and show 'd a sign in faint vermilion points prick 'd as a cunning workman in pekin pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase an emperor 's gift—at early morn he paints and all day long and when night comes the lamp lights up his studious forehead and thin hands— so delicately prick 'd the sign appear'd on sohrab 's arm the sign of rustum 's seal it was that griffin which of old rear 'd zal rustum 's great father whom they left to die a helpless babe among the mountain-rocks him that kind creature found and rear 'd and loved— then rustum took it for his glorious sign and sohrab bared that image on his arm and himself scann 'd it long with mournful eyes and then he touch 'd it with his hand and said — '' how say'st thou is that sign the proper sign of rustum 's son or of some other man 's '' he spoke but rustum gazed and gazed and stood speechless and then he utter 'd one sharp cry o boy—thy father —and his voice choked there and then a dark cloud pass 'd before his eyes and his head swam and he sank down to earth but sohrab crawl 'd to where he lay and cast his arms about his neck and kiss 'd his lips and with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks trying to call him back to life and life came back to rustum and he oped his eyes and they stood wide with horror and he seized in both his hands the dust which lay around and threw it on his head and smirch 'd his hair — his hair and face and beard and glittering arms and strong convulsive groanings shook his breast and his sobs choked him and he clutch 'd his sword to draw it and for ever let life out but sohrab saw his thoughts and held his hands and with a soothing voice he spake and said — '' father forbear for i but meet to-day the doom which at my birth was written down in heaven and thou art heaven 's unconscious hand surely my heart cried out that it was thou when first i saw thee and thy heart spoke too i know it but fate trod those promptings down under its iron heel fate fate engaged the strife and hurl 'd me on my father 's spear but let us speak no more of this i find my father let me feel that i have found come sit beside me on this sand and take my head betwixt thy hands and kiss my cheeks and wash them with thy tears and say my son quick quick for number 'd are my sands of life and swift for like the lightning to this field i came and like the wind i go away— sudden and swift and like a passing wind but it was writ in heaven that this should be '' so said he and his voice released the heart of rustum and his tears broke forth he cast his arms round his son 's neck and wept aloud and kiss 'd him and awe fell on both the hosts when they saw rustum 's grief and ruksh the horse with his head bowing to the ground and mane sweeping the dust came near and in mute woe first to the one then to the other moved his head as if enquiring what their grief might mean and from his dark compassionate eyes the big warm tears roll 'd down and caked the sand but rustum chid him with stern voice and said — '' ruksh now thou grievest but o ruksh thy feet should first have rotted on their nimble joints or ere they brought thy master to this field '' but sohrab look 'd upon the horse and said — '' is this then ruksh how often in past days my mother told me of thee thou brave steed my terrible father 's terrible horse and said that i should one day find thy lord and thee come let me lay my hand upon thy mane o ruksh thou art more fortunate than i for thou has gone where i shall never go and snuff 'd the breezes of my father 's home and thou hast trod the sands of seistan and seen the river of helmund and the lake of zirrah and the aged zal himself has often stroked thy neck and given thee food corn in a golden platter soak 'd with wine and said o ruksh bear rustrum well —but i have never known my grandsire 's furrow 'd face nor seen his lofty house in seistan nor slaked my thirst at the clear helmund stream but lodged among my father 's foes and seen afrasiab 's cities only samarcand bokhara and lone khiva in the waste and the black toorkmun tents and only drunk the desert rivers moorghab and tejend kohik and where the kalmuks feed their sheep the northern sir and this great oxus stream the yellow oxus by whose brink i die '' then with a heavy groan rustum bewail 'd — '' oh that its waves were flowing over me oh that i saw its grains of yellow silt roll tumbling in the current o'er my head '' but with a grave mild voice sohrab replied — '' desire not that my father thou must live for some are born to do great deeds and live as some are born to be obscured and die do thou the deeds i die too young to do and reap a second glory in thine age thou art my father and thy gain is mine but come thou seest this great host of men which follow me i pray thee slay not these let me entreat for them what have they done they follow 'd me my hope my fame my star let them all cross the oxus back in peace but me thou must bear hence not send with them but carry me with thee to seistan and place me on a bed and mourn for me thou and the snow-hair 'd zal and all thy friends and thou must lay me in that lovely earth and heap a stately mound above my bones and plant a far-seen pillar over all that so the passing horseman on the waste may see my tomb a great way off and cry sohrab the mighty rustum 's son lies there whom his great father did in ignorance kill and i be not forgotten in my grave '' and with a mournful voice rustum replied — '' fear not as thou hast said sohrab my son so shall it be for i will burn my tents and quit the host and bear thee hence with me and carry thee away to seistan and place thee on a bed and mourn for thee with the snow-headed zal and all my friends and i will lay thee in the lovely earth and heap a stately mound above thy bones and plant a far-seen pillar over all and men shall not forget thee in thy grave and i will spare thy host yea let them go let them all cross the oxus back in peace what should i do with slaying any more for would that all whom i have ever slain might be once more alive my bitterest foes and they who were call 'd champions in their time and through whose death i won that fame i have— and i were nothing but a common man a poor mean soldier and without renown so thou mightest live too my son my son or rather would that i even i myself might now be lying on this bloody sand near death and by an ignorant stroke of thine not thou of mine and i might die not thou and i not thou be borne to seistan and zal might weep above my grave not thine and say o son i weep thee not too sore for willingly i know thou met'st thine end but now in blood and battles was my youth and full of blood and battles is my age and i shall never end this life of blood '' then at the point of death sohrab replied — '' a life of blood indeed thou dreadful man but thou shalt yet have peace only not now not yet but thou shalt have it on that day when thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship thou and the other peers of kai khosroo returning home over the salt blue sea from laying thy dear master in his grave '' and rustum gazed in sohrab 's face and said — '' soon be that day my son and deep that sea till then if fate so wills let me endure '' he spoke and sohrab smiled on him and took the spear and drew it from his side and eased his wound 's imperious anguish but the blood came welling from the open gash and life flow 'd with the stream —all down his cold white side the crimson torrent ran dim now and soil 'd like the soil 'd tissue of white violets left freshly gather 'd on their native bank by children whom their nurses call with haste indoors from the sun 's eye his head droop 'd low his limbs grew slack motionless white he lay— white with eyes closed only when heavy gasps deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame convulsed him back to life he open 'd them and fix 'd them feebly on his father 's face till now all strength was ebb 'd and from his limbs unwillingly the spirit fled away regretting the warm mansion which it left and youth and bloom and this delightful world so on the bloody sand sohrab lay dead and the great rustum drew his horseman 's cloak down o'er his face and sate by his dead son as those black granite pillars once high-rear'd by jemshid in persepolis to bear his house now 'mid their broken flights of steps lie prone enormous down the mountain side— so in the sand lay rustum by his son and night came down over the solemn waste and the two gazing hosts and that sole pair and darken 'd all and a cold fog with night crept from the oxus soon a hum arose as of a great assembly loosed and fires began to twinkle through the fog for now both armies moved to camp and took their meal the persians took it on the open sands southward the tartars by the river marge and rustum and his son were left alone but the majestic river floated on out of the mist and hum of that low land into the frosty starlight and there moved rejoicing through the hush 'd chorasmian waste under the solitary moon —he flow'd right for the polar star past orgunjè brimming and bright and large then sands begin to hem his watery march and dam his streams and split his currents that for many a league the shorn and parcell 'd oxus strains along through beds of sand and matted rushy isles— oxus forgetting the bright speed he had in his high mountain-cradle in pamere a foil 'd circuitous wanderer—till at last the long'd-for dash of waves is heard and wide his luminous home of waters opens bright and tranquil from whose floor the new-bathed stars emerge and shine upon the aral sea

when i consider how my light is spent ere half my days in this dark world and wide and that one talent which is death to hide lodged with me useless though my soul more bent to serve therewith my maker and present my true account lest he returning chide “ doth god exact day-labour light denied ” i fondly ask but patience to prevent that murmur soon replies “ god doth not need either man ’ s work or his own gifts who best bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state is kingly thousands at his bidding speed and post o ’ er land and ocean without rest they also serve who only stand and wait ”
beloved my beloved when i think that thou wast in the world a year ago what time i sate alone here in the snow and saw no footprint heard the silence sink no moment at thy voice ... but link by link went counting all my chains as if that so they never could fall off at any blow struck by thy possible hand ... why thus i drink of life 's great cup of wonder wonderful never to feel thee thrill the day or night with personal act or speech —nor ever cull some prescience of thee with the blossoms white thou sawest growing atheists are as dull who can not guess god 's presence out of sight
the face of all the world is changed i think since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul move still oh still beside me as they stole betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink of obvious death where i who thought to sink was caught up into love and taught the whole of life in a new rhythm the cup of dole god gave for baptism i am fain to drink and praise its sweetness sweet with thee anear the names of country heaven are changed away for where thou art or shalt be there or here and this ... this lute and song ... loved yesterday the singing angels know are only dear because thy name moves right in what they say

deep on the convent-roof the snows are sparkling to the moon my breath to heaven like vapour goes may my soul follow soon the shadows of the convent-towers slant down the snowy sward still creeping with the creeping hours that lead me to my lord make thou my spirit pure and clear as are the frosty skies or this first snowdrop of the year that in my bosom lies as these white robes are soil 'd and dark to yonder shining ground as this pale taper 's earthly spark to yonder argent round so shows my soul before the lamb my spirit before thee so in mine earthly house i am to that i hope to be break up the heavens o lord and far thro all yon starlight keen draw me thy bride a glittering star in raiment white and clean he lifts me to the golden doors the flashes come and go all heaven bursts her starry floors and strows her lights below and deepens on and up the gates roll back and far within for me the heavenly bridegroom waits to make me pure of sin the sabbaths of eternity one sabbath deep and wide— a light upon the shining sea— the bridegroom with his bride
every town with black catholics has a st. peter claver ’ s my first was nursery school miss maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army cots no mother questioned no child sassed in blue pleated skirts pants and white shirts we stood in line to use the open toilets and conserved light by walking in darkness unsmiling mostly light-skinned we were the children of the middle class preparing to take our parents ’ places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait they said it was good for us the bowl of soup its pasty whiteness i learned to swallow and distrust my senses on holy cards st. peter ’ s face is olive-toned his hair near kinky i thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor the light and dark now i read he was “ a spanish jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the african negroes and the abolition of the slave trade. ” i was tricked again robbed of my patron and left with a debt to another white man
through alpine meadows soft-suffused with rain where thick the crocus blows past the dark forges long disused the mule-track from saint laurent goes the bridge is cross 'd and slow we ride through forest up the mountain-side the autumnal evening darkens round the wind is up and drives the rain while hark far down with strangled sound doth the dead guier 's stream complain where that wet smoke among the woods over his boiling cauldron broods swift rush the spectral vapours white past limestone scars with ragged pines showing—then blotting from our sight — halt—through the cloud-drift something shines high in the valley wet and drear the huts of courrerie appear strike leftward cries our guide and higher mounts up the stony forest-way at last the encircling trees retire look through the showery twilight grey what pointed roofs are these advance — a palace of the kings of france approach for what we seek is here alight and sparely sup and wait for rest in this outbuilding near then cross the sward and reach that gate knock pass the wicket thou art come to the carthusians world-famed home the silent courts where night and day into their stone-carved basins cold the splashing icy fountains play— the humid corridors behold where ghostlike in the deepening night cowl 'd forms brush by in gleaming white the chapel where no organ 's peal invests the stern and naked prayer— with penitential cries they kneel and wrestle rising then with bare and white uplifted faces stand passing the host from hand to hand each takes and then his visage wan is buried in his cowl once more the cells —the suffering son of man upon the wall—the knee-worn floor— and where they sleep that wooden bed which shall their coffin be when dead the library where tract and tome not to feed priestly pride are there to hymn the conquering march of rome nor yet to amuse as ours are they paint of souls the inner strife their drops of blood their death in life the garden overgrown—yet mild see fragrant herbs are flowering there strong children of the alpine wild whose culture is the brethren 's care of human tasks their only one and cheerful works beneath the sun those halls too destined to contain each its own pilgrim-host of old from england germany or spain— all are before me i behold the house the brotherhood austere —and what am i that i am here for rigorous teachers seized my youth and purged its faith and trimm 'd its fire show 'd me the high white star of truth there bade me gaze and there aspire even now their whispers pierce the gloom what dost thou in this living tomb forgive me masters of the mind at whose behest i long ago so much unlearnt so much resign'd— i come not here to be your foe i seek these anchorites not in ruth to curse and to deny your truth not as their friend or child i speak but as on some far northern strand thinking of his own gods a greek in pity and mournful awe might stand before some fallen runic stone— for both were faiths and both are gone wandering between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born with nowhere yet to rest my head like these on earth i wait forlorn their faith my tears the world deride— i come to shed them at their side oh hide me in your gloom profound ye solemn seats of holy pain take me cowl 'd forms and fence me round till i possess my soul again till free my thoughts before me roll not chafed by hourly false control for the world cries your faith is now but a dead time 's exploded dream my melancholy sciolists say is a pass 'd mode an outworn theme— as if the world had ever had a faith or sciolists been sad ah if it be pass 'd take away at least the restlessness the pain be man henceforth no more a prey to these out-dated stings again the nobleness of grief is gone ah leave us not the fret alone but—if you can not give us ease— last of the race of them who grieve here leave us to die out with these last of the people who believe silent while years engrave the brow silent—the best are silent now achilles ponders in his tent the kings of modern thought are dumb silent they are though not content and wait to see the future come they have the grief men had of yore but they contend and cry no more our fathers water 'd with their tears this sea of time whereon we sail their voices were in all men 's ears we pass 'd within their puissant hail still the same ocean round us raves but we stand mute and watch the waves for what avail 'd it all the noise and outcry of the former men — say have their sons achieved more joys say is life lighter now than then the sufferers died they left their pain— the pangs which tortured them remain what helps it now that byron bore with haughty scorn which mock 'd the smart through europe to the ætolian shore the pageant of his bleeding heart that thousands counted every groan and europe made his woe her own what boots it shelley that the breeze carried thy lovely wail away musical through italian trees which fringe thy soft blue spezzian bay inheritors of thy distress have restless hearts one throb the less or are we easier to have read o obermann the sad stern page which tells us how thou hidd'st thy head from the fierce tempest of thine age in the lone brakes of fontainebleau or chalets near the alpine snow ye slumber in your silent grave — the world which for an idle day grace to your mood of sadness gave long since hath flung her weeds away the eternal trifler breaks your spell but we—we learned your lore too well years hence perhaps may dawn an age more fortunate alas than we which without hardness will be sage and gay without frivolity sons of the world oh speed those years but while we wait allow our tears allow them we admire with awe the exulting thunder of your race you give the universe your law you triumph over time and space your pride of life your tireless powers we laud them but they are not ours we are like children rear 'd in shade beneath some old-world abbey wall forgotten in a forest-glade and secret from the eyes of all deep deep the greenwood round them waves their abbey and its close of graves but where the road runs near the stream oft through the trees they catch a glance of passing troops in the sun 's beam— pennon and plume and flashing lance forth to the world those soldiers fare to life to cities and to war and through the wood another way faint bugle-notes from far are borne where hunters gather staghounds bay round some fair forest-lodge at morn gay dames are there in sylvan green laughter and cries—those notes between the banners flashing through the trees make their blood dance and chain their eyes that bugle-music on the breeze arrests them with a charm 'd surprise banner by turns and bugle woo ye shy recluses follow too o children what do ye reply — '' action and pleasure will ye roam through these secluded dells to cry and call us —but too late ye come too late for us your call ye blow whose bent was taken long ago `` long since we pace this shadow 'd nave we watch those yellow tapers shine emblems of hope over the grave in the high altar 's depth divine the organ carries to our ear its accents of another sphere `` fenced early in this cloistral round of reverie of shade of prayer how should we grow in other ground how can we flower in foreign air —pass banners pass and bugles cease and leave our desert to its peace ''

yes in the sea of life enisled with echoing straits between us thrown dotting the shoreless watery wild we mortal millions live alone the islands feel the enclasping flow and then their endless bounds they know but when the moon their hollows lights and they are swept by balms of spring and in their glens on starry nights the nightingales divinely sing and lovely notes from shore to shore across the sounds and channels pour— oh then a longing like despair is to their farthest caverns sent for surely once they feel we were parts of a single continent now round us spreads the watery plain— oh might our marges meet again who order 'd that their longing 's fire should be as soon as kindled cool 'd who renders vain their deep desire — a god a god their severance ruled and bade betwixt their shores to be the unplumb 'd salt estranging sea

amazing to believe that nothingness surrounds us with delight and lets us be and that the meekness of nonentity despite the friction of the world of sense despite the leveling of violence is all that matters all the energy we force into the matchhead and the city explodes inside a loving emptiness not dante ’ s rings not the zen zero ’ s mouth out of which comes and into which light goes this god recedes from every metaphor turns the hardest data into untruth and fills all blanks with blankness this love shows itself in absence which the stars adore

a reincarnation phantasy this was the story never told by one who cared not for the world ’ s gold one of the idle and wise a beggar with unfathomable eyes one who had nothing but dreams to give to men who are eager to labour and live for the world in its wisdom deep and dim had taken all pleasure and treasure from him this was the story his soul could tell immortal and unfathomable there was no record in his brain he did not know he should live again but there was one who read the whole buried deep in a dead man ’ s soul “ in the days of atlantis under the wave i was a slave the child of a slave when the towers of atlantis fell i died and was born again in hell from that sorrowful prison i did escape and hid myself in a hero ’ s shape but few years had i of love or joy a trojan i fell at the siege of troy i came again in a little while an israelite slave on the banks of the nile then did i comfort my grief-laden heart with the magic lore and egyptian art fain was i to become osiris then but soon i came back to the world of men by the ganges i was an outcast born a wanderer and a child of scorn by the waters of babylon i wept my harp amongst the willows slept in the land of greece i opened my eyes to reap the fields of plotinus the wise when the great light shattered the world ’ s closed bars i was a shepherd who gazed at the stars for lives that were lonely obscure apart i thank the hidden one in my heart that always and always under the sun i went forth to battle and never won a slayer of men i was doomed to abide for ever and aye on the losing side whenever i dream of the wonderful goal i thank the hidden god in my soul that though i have always been meanly born a tiller of earth and a reaper of corn whenever through ages past and gone the light divine for a moment shone whenever piercing laborious night a ray fell straight from the light of light whenever amid fierce lightning and storm the divine moved in a human form whenever the earth in her cyclic course shook at the touch of an unknown force whenever the cloud of dull years grew thin and a great star called to the light within i have braved storm and labour and sun to stand at the side that holy one no matter how humble my birth has been there are few who have seen what i have seen mine the shepherd ’ s star and the reaper ’ s reward and the dream of him who fell by the sword one thing i have learned the long years through to know the false words from the true the slave who toiled on the banks of the nile with wisdom gladdened his long exile from buddha at eve by the ganges ’ side an outcast learnt the worth of the world ’ s pride to the tired reaper when day was done did plotinus unveil the hidden sun amongst the stars on a syrian night a ragged shepherd found the light of light from dream to dream o ’ er valley and hill i followed the lord christ 's wandering will kings there are who would barter a throne for the long day ’ s toil and the light unknown the deed of the strong and the word of the wise and the night under cold and starry skies— the white light of dawn on the hillside shed on him who had nowhere to lay his head behold there are kings who would change with me for the love of the ancient mystery shepherd and reaper and slave i have been there are few who have seen what i have seen i have been a gipsy since those days and lived again in the wild wood ways wise with the lore of those hidden things learnt from lord christ in his wanderings beggar and reaper and shepherd and slave i am one who rests not in any grave i will follow each stormy light divine and the secret of all things shall be mine these things have i seen would you bid me mourn that i was never an emperor born ”

her unawed face whose pose so long assumed is touched with what reality we feel bends to itself and to itself resumed restores a tender fiction to the real and in her artful posture movement lies whose timeless motion flesh must so conceal yet what her pose conceals we might surmise and might pretend to gather from her eyes the final motion flesh gives up to art but slowly if we watch her long enough the nerves grow subtler and she moves apart into a space too dim with time and blood for our set eyes to follow true enough or nerves to guess about her if they would
mother whose virgin bosom was uncrost with the least shade of thought to sin allied woman above all women glorified our tainted nature 's solitary boast purer than foam on central ocean tost brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn with fancied roses than the unblemished moon before her wane begins on heaven 's blue coast thy image falls to earth yet some i ween not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend as to a visible power in which did blend all that was mixed and reconciled in thee of mother 's love with maiden purity of high with low celestial with terrene
sweet day so cool so calm so bright the bridal of the earth and sky the dew shall weep thy fall to-night for thou must die sweet rose whose hue angry and brave bids the rash gazer wipe his eye thy root is ever in its grave and thou must die sweet spring full of sweet days and roses a box where sweets compacted lie my music shows ye have your closes and all must die only a sweet and virtuous soul like season 'd timber never gives but though the whole world turn to coal then chiefly lives
i have not walked on common ground nor drunk of earthly streams a shining figure mailed and crowned moves softly through my dreams he makes the air so keen and strange the stars so fiercely bright the rocks of time the tides of change are nothing in his sight death lays no shadow on his smile life is a race fore-run look in his face a little while and life and death are one
1once in mexico an old man was leading on a string—was it a cat and we saw it was a tarantula sidling along in the dust writing a message from god for people who thought they knew where creature-life ended 2we came upon scenes like that the world back of a lurid pane of glass like in reno—they have emptied hollywood and ordered the extras and the stars to go get married and divorced in reno making up their stories as they go and letting their little dogs decide which machines or churches to put nickels and dimes into 3one day in a cut quick to the bone it was white white and then the world came in i got a tourniquet going but the snow had learned a whole new way to look at the sky as in maryland in the red fields how the stones come startlingly white on the battlefields the cemeteries along the gouged-out roads there history blows about on dandelion seeds 4on the plains near wakeeney above the ground short of the earth at the level of the eyes a sunset ray extended for miles we drove along it and let our thoughts down gingerly to touch what happened where genevieve lived she went out of the world for death her town holds quiet in the big plain lights witness one by one all over what still abides there was no one better her town her town her town the tires repeat as we go by 5for those my friends who want me to know to discover and combine all my best thoughts i roll up and let fall carelessly it is better than no one follow even the pattern i look onto the back of my hand for many visions i haven ’ t dared follow may gather and combine in a flash away off in a space in the sky i let the sky look at me and i look back and do not say anything
standing at the baggage passing time austin texas airport—my ride hasn ’ t come yet my former wife is making websites from her home one son ’ s seldom seen the other one and his wife have a boy and girl of their own my wife and stepdaughter are spending weekdays in town so she can get to high school my mother ninety-six still lives alone and she ’ s in town too always gets her sanity back just barely in time my former former wife has become a unique poet most of my work such as it is is done full moon was october second this year i ate a mooncake slept out on the deck white light beaming through the black boughs of the pine owl hoots and rattling antlers castor and pollux rising strong —it ’ s good to know that the pole star drifts that even our present night sky slips away not that i ’ ll see it or maybe i will much later some far time walking the spirit path in the sky that long walk of spirits—where you fall right back into the “ narrow painful passageway of the bardo ” squeeze your little skull and there you are again waiting for your ride october 5 2001
anyone with quiet pace who walks a gray road in the west may hear a badger underground where in deep flint another time is caught by flint and held forever the quiet pace of god stopped still anyone who listens walks on time that dogs him single file to mountains that are far from people the face of the land gone gray like flint badgers dig their little lives there quiet-paced the land lies gaunt the railroad dies by a yellow depot town falls away toward a muddy creek badger-gray the sod goes under a river of wind a hawk on a stick
today i ’ m thinking of st. paul—st paul who orders us be perfect he could have said touch your elbow to your ears except that if you broke your arm then snapped your neck you might could manage it the death inside the flawed hard currency of what we touch bamboozles us existing only for that flaw that deathward plunge that ’ s locked inside all form till what seems solid floats away dissolves and these poor bastard things no longer things drift back to pure idea and when at last we let them go we start to pity them attend their needs i almost have to think to keep my own heart beating through the night i have a wife and four pink boys i spin on all this stupid metaphysic now because last afternoon we visited some friends in town after the pecan pie i drank until my forehead smacked the table and woke to find my shirt crusted with blood when mary didn ’ t yell at me i knew she finally understood that i was gone dissolving back as we rode home i tried to say i ’ m sorry hon the carriage bucked across the mud-dried ruts and i shut up and she in august heat just sat head cocked as if for chills hidden in the hot damp breeze as if they were a sound time merely distance o death i know exactly where it is— your sting and grave i know your victory that night around the tents the boys caught fireflies pinched them in half and smeared them on their nails then ran through pine-dark woods waving their hands all i could hear was laughter shouts and all that i could see for each one of my sons were ten blurs of faint artificial light never too far apart and trembling like fairies magic sprites they ran and shouted “ i ’ m not real i ’ m not real ” the whole world fell away from me—perhaps i was still drunk— as on the night titania told dazed bottom “ put off your human grossness so and like an airy spirit go. ” but even then the night could not hold long against the light and light destroys roots fog lies orchids night dawn stars the moon delusions and most magic and light sends into hiding owls fireflies and bats whom for their unerring blunder i adore the most of all night fliers but owls hid in a hickory will hoot all day and even the moon persists like my hangover some days till almost noon drifting above the harsh bright murderous morning light—so blue so valuable so much like currency that if the moon were my blue coin i ’ d never spend it

i he dines alone surrounded by reflections of himself then after sleep and benzedrine descends the cinquecento stair his magic wrought from hypochondria of the well- to-do and nagging deathwish of the poor swirls on smiling genuflections of his liveried chauffeur into a crested lilac limousine the cynosure of mousey neighbors tittering behind venetian blinds and half afraid of him and half admiring his outrageous flair ii meanwhile his mother priestess in gold lamé precedes him to the quondam theater now israel temple of the highest alpha where the bored the sick the alien the tired await euphoria with deadly vigor she prepares the way for mystery and lucre shouts in blues-contralto ” he ’ s god ’ s dictaphone of all-redeeming truth oh he ’ s the holyweight champeen who ’ s come to give the knockout lick to your bad luck say he ’ s the holyweight champeen who ’ s here to deal a knockout punch to your hard luck. “ iii reposing on cushions of black leopard skin he telephones instructions for a long slow drive across the park that burgeons now with spring and sailors peers questingly into the green fountainous twilight sighs and turns the gold-plate dial to music for your dining-dancing pleasure smoking egyptian cigarettes rehearses in his mind a new device that he must use tonight iv approaching israel temple mask in place he hears ragtime allegros of a ” song of zion “ that becomes when he appears a hallelujah wave for him to walk his mother and a rainbow-surpliced cordon conduct him choiring to the altar-stage and there he kneels and seems to pray before a lighted jesus painted sealskin-brown then with a glittering flourish he arises turns gracefully extends his draperied arms “ israelites true jews o found lost tribe of israel receive my blessing now selah selah. ” he feels them yearn toward him as toward a lover exults before the image of himself their trust gives back stands as though in meditation letting their eyes caress his garments jewelled and chatoyant cut to fall to flow from his tall figure dramatically just so then all at once he sways quivers gesticulates as if to ward off blows or kisses and when he speaks again he utters wildering vocables hypnotic no-words planned and never failing to enmesh his flock in theopathic tension cries of eudaemonic pain attest his artistry behind the mask he smiles and now in subtly altering light he chants and sinuously trembles chants and trembles while convulsive energies of eager faith surcharge the theater with power of their own a power he has counted on and for a space allows to carry him dishevelled antiphons proclaim the moment his followers all day have hungered for but which is his alone he signals tambourines begin frenetic drumbeat and glissando he dances from the altar robes hissing flaring shimmering down aisles where mantled guardsmen intercept wild hands that arduously strain to clutch his vestments he dances dances ensorcelled and aloof the fervid juba of god as lover healer conjurer and of himself as god
nights by the light of whatever would burn tallow tinder and the silken rope of wick that burns slow slow we wove the baskets from the long gold strands of wheat that were another silk worm soul spun the one yellow seed in the dark soil the other the fields lay fallow swollen with frost expectant winter mud clung to the edges of our gowns we had hung back like shadows on the walls of trees and watched in the little circles that our tapers threw murdered men rose red in their clanging armor muttered words that bled through the bars of iron masks the lord who sold us to the glory fields lied trumpets without tongues we wove lilies into the baskets when they asked us what we meant by these we ’ d say “ mary mary ” and be still we lined the baskets on the sill in the barn where it is always dusk and the cows smell sweet now the snow sifts through the trees dismembered lace the white dust of angels angels and the ringing of keys that hang in bunches at our waists and the sound of silk whispering whispering there is nothing in the high windows but swirling snow the glittering milk of winter the halls grow chill the candles flicker let them wait who will and think what they want the lord has gone with the hunt and the snow the snow grows thicker well he will keep till spring thaw comes head hand and heart— baskets of wicker baskets of straw
they got me into the sunday-school in spoon river and tried to get me to drop confucius for jesus i could have been no worse off if i had tried to get them to drop jesus for confucius for without any warning as if it were a prank and sneaking up behind me harry wiley the minister 's son caved my ribs into my lungs with a blow of his fist now i shall never sleep with my ancestors in pekin and no children shall worship at my grave
here comes the wise man in the story of sick times telling you how to find the passage of satisfaction he is many million years old and has been walking many thousand miles more miles more lengths of road than the shrunk-up earth of these days possesses to find you he has a veda from before creation to sing you and lo and behold it is about you it means everything to you though they ’ ve made a rope out of rough heavy smoke like a whale-thick hawser for a steamer of dead star and pulled it through you from throat to crotch from ear to ear and hag-tied your hands and feet with the ends though each of them has your own face molten with leprosy though your brain makes the sound of crowded trains colliding in kashmir and a stadium that roars hosanna it is still possible now in the next moment to know god that is not die in confusion but maybe then this guru is too soon maybe he hasn ’ t come from far enough maybe he ’ s still much too young maybe he ’ s never asked himself clearly what happens when someone like you hears that a lightning-opened living fig tree or a mountain and a blue sky can be lived in and sets out on the long road never moving from his realm in pain
from the far star points of his pinned extremities cold inched in—black ice and squid ink— till the hung flesh was empty lonely in that void even for pain he missed his splintered feet the human stare buried in his face he ached for two hands made of meat he could reach to the end of in the corpse ’ s core the stone fist of his heart began to bang on the stiff chest ’ s door and breath spilled back into that battered shape now it ’ s your limbs he comes to fill as warm water shatters at birth rivering every way
i have seen the old gods go and the new gods come day by day and year by year the idols fall and the idols rise today i worship the hammer
finally i gave up on obeisance and refused to welcome either retribution or the tease of sunny days as for the can ’ t-be- seen the sum-of-all-details the one—oh when it came to salvation i was only sure i needed to be spared someone else ’ s version of it the small prayers i devised had in them the hard sounds of split and frost i wanted them to speak as if it made sense to speak to what isn ’ t there in the beaconless dark i wanted them to startle by how little they asked
you may think it strange sam that i 'm writing a letter in these circumstances i thought it strange too—the first time but there's a misconception i was laboring under and you are too viz that the imagination in your vicinity is free and powerful after all you say you 've been creating yourself all along imaginatively you imagine yourself playing golf or hiking in the olympics or writing a poem and then it becomes true but you still have to do it you have to exert yourself will courage whatever you 've got you're mired in the unimaginative here i imagine a letter and it 's written takes about two-fifths of a second your time hell this is heaven man i can deluge congress with letters telling every one of those mendacious sons of bitches exactly what he or she is in maybe about half an hour in spite of your buddhist proclivities when you imagine bliss you still must struggle to get there by the way the buddha has his place across town on elysian drive we call him bud he 's lost weight and got new dentures and he looks a hell of a lot better than he used to he always carries a jumping jack with him everywhere just for contemplation but he does n't make it jump he only looks at it meanwhile sidney and dizzy uncle ben and papa yancey are over by sylvester 's grot making the sweetest cheerfulest blues you ever heard the air so called is full of it poems are fluttering everywhere like seed from a cottonwood tree sam the remarkable truth is i can do any fucking thing i want speaking of which there 's this dazzling young naomi who wiped out on i-80 just west of truckee last winter and i think this is the moment for me to go and pay her my respects do n't go way i 'll be right back
taut with longing you must become the god you sought— the only one
the sun is high the seaside air is sharp and salty light reveals the mayan school the irish hope their names are on the harp we see the sheep 's advertisement for wool boulders are here to throw against a tarp from which comes bursting forth a puzzled mule perceval seizes it and mounts it then the blood-dimmed tide recedes and then comes in again fateful connections that we make to things whose functioning 's oblivious to our lives how sidewise news of light from darkness springs how blue bees buzz from big blooms back to hives and make the honey while the queen bee sings leadbelly in arrangements by burl ives— how long ago i saw the misted pine trees and hoped no matter how to get them into poetry stendhal at fifty gazing as it happened on rome from the janiculum decided that one way he could give his life a stipend was to suspend his being amour 's fighter and get to know himself here he had ripened accomplished loved and lived was a great writer but never had explored in true detail his childhood and his growing up so he set sail composing la vie de henry brulard but in five hundred pages scarcely got beyond his seventeenth year for it is hard to take into account what happens here and fit it all onto an index card even one moment of it is too hot complex and cannibalistically connected to every other which is what might be expected sterne 's hero has a greater problem never getting much past his birth i 've had a third one my autobiography if i should ever start out to write it quickly seems a burden an i-will-do-that-the-next-time endeavor whatever life i do write 's an absurd one as if some crazy person with a knife cut up and made a jigsaw puzzle of a life in any case a life that 's hardly possible in the conditions that we really live in where easy flying leaps to inaccessible mountainy places where love is a given and misery if there infinitesimal are quite the norm here none by pain is driven that is not curable by the romanza that 's kept in readiness to finish any stanza whatever then i see at this late stage of my life i may or may not have stayed ignorant of that great book i 've strained to write one page of yet always hoping my page was significant be it or not for me and for the ages i leave it as it is yet as a figurant who has not stopped i 'm writing in addition more lines to clarify my present disposition one person in a million finds out something perhaps each fifty years and that is knowledge newton copernicus einstein are cunning the rest of us just rise and go to college with no more hope to come home with the bunting than a stray dachshund going through the village however what a treat our small successes of present and of past at various addresses to be in all those places where i tarried too little or too late or bright and early to love again the first woman i married to marvel at such things as melancholy sophistication drums a baby carriage a john cage concert heard at alice tully— how my desire when young to be a poet made me attentive and oblivious every moment do you remember oceanview the fair the heights above the river the canoes the place we beached them and the grass was bare those days the sandbars gave our knees a truce the crooked line of pantry shelves with pear and cherry jam and pancho with his noose do you remember full and half and empty do you remember sorrow standing in the entry do you remember thought and talking plainly michel and i went walking after chartres cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly by giving us an insight into barthes michel said he was capable of feigning renewed intentions of the soul 's deep part like this cathedral 's artificial forces that press a kind of artless thought into our faces and yet— the moor is dark beneath the moon the porcupine turns over on its belly and new conceptions rap at the cocoon civilization dealing with us fairly for once releases its erectheion of understanding which consoles us nearly later we study certain characteristics that may give us a better chance with the statistics how much i 'd like to live the whole thing over but making some corrections as i go to be a better husband and a father be with my babies on a sled in snow by twenty i 'd have understood my mother and by compassion found a way to know what separates the what-i-started-out-as from what-i-sometimes-wished-i-was-when-in-the-mountains to be once more the one who what was worthy of courtship courted—it was quite as stressful as trying to er as they say give birth to a poem and as often unsuccessful but it was nice to be sublime and flirty with radiant girls and in some strange way restful i could be everything i was n't usually— and then to get somebody else to feel it mutually in poems the same problem or a similar desire of course not only to do old things but things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors and of the melancholy finch be co-finch in singing songs with such a broad parameter that seamstresses would stare forget to sew things astronauts quit the sky athletes the stadium to hear them and the rest of what they hear be tedium such wild desires i think it 's recognizable are part and parcel of the human image and in a way i 'd say no less predictable than popeye 's feelings for a can of spinach yet if we 're set on course by the invisible all pre-determined what about the language that teases me each morning with its leanings toward the unprogrammed altitudes beyond its meanings are you o particles o atoms nominatives like percevals and stendhals set in motion by some ordaining will that is definitive is this invading chill and high emotion this tendency to know one is regenerative is this all tidal take-home like the ocean be what you may my thanks for your society through the long life i 've had your jokes and your variety the warmth you 've shown in giving me a temperature that i can live with and the strength you 've shared with me in arms and legs—and for your part in literature what can i say it is as if life stared at me and kissed my lips and left it as a signature thank you for that and thank you for preparing me for love itself and friendship its co-agent thank you for being this and for its inspiration
christmas trees lined like war refugees a fallen army made to stand in their greens cut down at the foot on their last leg they pull themselves up arms raised we drop them like wood tied they are driven through the streets dragged through the door cornered in a room given a single blanket only water to drink surrounded by joy forced to wear a gaudy gold star to surrender their pride they do their best to look alive
diluvian draggled and derelict posse this barnacled pod so pales next to everything we hear of red tides and pilot whales that a word like “ drama ” makes me sound remiss except that there was a kind of littoral drama in the way the shells silently sans the heraldry of bells neatly sans an astrological affair and swiftly sans a multitude of feet flat-out arrived— an encrusted school of twenty-four gabriellan trumpets at my beach house door and barely half-alive oh you can bet i picked them up waded right up to my ankles in there among ’ em hefted ’ em up to my ears to hear the din of all things oceanwise and wet but every of the ancient bearded anthracite salt-water-logged spirals every of the massive and unwieldy magisterial mollusks shut tight— no din no horns roaring reveille no warning no beat no taps no coral corpus no porpoise purpose except it was a secret purpose kept strictly under wraps a fine christmas gift indeed this obscure migration this half-dead conch confederation which would have smelled yon tannenbaum like fish— a fine set of unwrappable presents and no receipt by which i could redeem them i lifted one up by its stem and thought of how by increments all twenty-four must have lugged those preassembled bodies here sans santa sleigh and eight little reindeer to my drasty stretch of shore and no other explanation being offered for the situation i thought that i might understand how one could argue that the impulse driving them to land was a sort of evolutionary one— misguided yes redundant a million years too late a needless maybe rogue and almost campy demonstration of how history even in the world of the invertebrate repeats itself—breaker crashing down on breaker in the gulf gulf war coming after gulf war o maker there is so much slug inside these shells here at the end of december at the edge of a world i couldn ’ t blame if you did not remember miracles sell well but lord it can be numbing to a people who can not tell between a second nature and a second thought a second chance or a second coming
there is a heaviness between us nameless raised from the void that counts out the sprung hours what ash has it come to purify what disappearance like water does it lift up to the clouds god of my fathers but not of mine you are a part it is said an afterthought a scattered one there is a disappearance between us as heavy as dirt what figure of earth and clay would it have me become sunday again january thaw back big time the knock-kneed overweight boys and girls sit on the sun-warmed concrete sidewalk outside the pharmacy smoking their dun-filtered cigarettes nothing is bothering them—and their nicotine dreams— this afternoon everything 's weightless as insubstantial as smoke nothing is disappearing in their world arrival is all there is a picture of yves klein leaping out of a window above a cobblestone paris street a man on a bicycle peddles away toward the distance one of them 's you the other is me cut out of the doctored photograph however the mesh net right under the swan-diving body cut out of another print the black-capped ever-distancing cyclist as well as the mesh net hmm and there you have it two-fingered sleight-of-hand man one loses one 's center in the air trying to stay afloat does n't one snowfalling metaphors unbidden tears the off-size of small apples unshed and unshedable such heaviness the world has come and lies between us such distance ungraspable ash and its disappearance— unbearable absence of being tonto then taken back
before my first communion i clung to doubt as satan spider-like stalked the orb of dark surrounding eden for a wormhole into paradise god had formed me from gel in my mother ’ s womb injected by my dad ’ s smart shoot they swapped sighs until i came smaller than a bite of burger quietly i grew till my lungs were done then the lord sailed a soul like a lit arrow to inhabit me maybe that piercing made me howl at birth or the masked creatures whose scalpel cut a lightning bolt to free me i was hoisted by the heels and swatted fed and hauled around time-lapse photos show my fingers grow past crayon outlines my feet come to fill spike heels eventually i lurched out to kiss the wrong mouths get stewed and sulk around christ always stood to one side with a glass of water i swatted the sap away when my thirst got great enough to ask a clear stream welled up inside some jade wave buoyed me forward and i found myself upright in the instant with a garden inside my own ribs aflourish there the arbor leafs the vines push out plump grapes you are loved someone said take that and eat it
how strange my lack of faith must seem to you i see the way your god provides a cradle for your grief how lovely to be certain that the ancient story 's true you sang the hymns as if each word were new— at last you sang at last in your eternal arms i 'll find relief how strange my lack of faith must seem to you — while i kept drifting lost in the refrains and in the blue fragility the tinted glass provided us to bow beneath how lovely to be certain that the ancient story 's true beneath that moderated sky we rose and sang and cried on cue familiar words were read to keep our sorrow brief how sad my lack of faith must seem to you the book upon the altar and the hymnals in each pew held pages edged in fine gold leaf— how lovely seeing that the ancient story 's true— and i was wondering just what it cost to see this vaulting through the ceilings windows ornament the engineering of belief but let my lack of faith seem strange to you you 're lovely certain that the ancient story 's true
then there 's the yemeni legend of eve in the garden knitting a pattern on the serpent 's back the snake unfinished like the rest of creation the first woman thinking to add design a sheath of interlocking diamonds and stripes along that sensuous s knitting giving her time to learn what 's infinitely possible with a few stitches twisting cables hers a plan to mirror the divine inner layer that ca n't be shed no matter what it rubs up against
for ira with the seal of science emblazoned on your forehead like the old good housekeeping seal of approval i believe what you tell me about cells and molecules though i ca n't see them and though the language you speak is full of numbers and symbols i 'll never understand though your tie is askew and your hair unruly still i believe what you say about the size of the universe which is either expanding or contracting i 've forgotten which already so if tomorrow you tell me you made a small miscalculation that god indeed created the world in 6 short days then rested on the 7th that it was eve who landed us in all this trouble i would believe you i would believe you as i 've always done before

life 's spell is so exquisite everything conspires to break it emily dickinson it was n't bliss what was bliss but the ordinary life she 'd spend hours in patter moving through whole days touching sniffing tasting exquisite housekeeping in a charmed world and yet there was always more of the same all that happiness the aimless being there so she wandered for a while bush to arbor lingered to look through a pond 's restive mirror he was off cataloging the universe probably pretending he could organize what was clearly someone else 's chaos that 's when she found the tree the dark crabbed branches bearing up such speechless bounty she knew without being told this was forbidden it wasn't a question of ownership— who could lay claim to such maddening perfection and there was no voice in her head no whispered intelligence lurking in the leaves—just an ache that grew until she knew she 'd already lost everything except desire the red heft of it warming her outstretched palm

the number of corners in the soul can't compare with the universe 's dimensions folded neatly into swans in the soul's space one word on a thousand pieces of paper the size of cookie fortunes falls from the heavens at last the oracular answer you cry pawing at the scraps that twirl like seed-pod helicopters alas the window to your soul needs a good scrubbing so the letters doodle into indecipherables just like every answer that has rained down through history and you realize in your little smog of thought that death will simply be the cessation of asking a thousand cranes unfolding themselves and returning to the trees
when he had suckled there he began to grow first he was an infant in her arms but soon drinking and drinking at the sweet milk she could not keep from filling her from pouring into his ravenous mouth and filling again miraculous pitcher mercy feeding its own extinction soon he was huge towering above her the landscape his shadow stealing the color from the fields even the flowers going gray and they came like ants one behind the next to worship him—huge as he was and hungry it was his hunger they admired most of all so they brought him slaughtered beasts goats oxen bulls and finally their own kin whose hunger was a kind of shame to them a shrinkage even as his was beautiful to them magnified magnificent the day came when they had nothing left to offer him having denuded themselves of all in order to enlarge him in whose shadow they dreamed of light and that is when the thought began to move small at first a whisper then a buzz and finally it broke out into words so loud they thought it must be prophecy they would kill him and all they had lost in his name would return renewed and fresh with the dew of morning hope fed their rage sharpened their weapons and who is she hooded figure mourner now at the fate of what she fed and the slow rain which never ends who is the father of that and who are we who speak as if the world were our diorama—its little figures moved by hidden gears precious in miniature tin soldiers spears the size of pins perfect replicas history under glass dusty old fashioned a curiosity that no one any longer wants to see excited as they are by the new giant who feeds on air grows daily on radio waves in cyberspace who sows darkness like a desert storm who blows like a wind through the boardrooms who touches the hills and they smoke

often when he was advancing feeling his way in the night he was doubtful rebelled wanted to climb back up to the old light but a force held him enjoined him to pursue to venture once more once again into the thickest darkness of his shadow one day at the height of his distress emptied of all force driven to see that the inaccessible would not yield he admitted that he must renounce it to his great surprise without his having to take a single step he crossed the threshold came into the light
at san raffaele arcangelo one angel got it all wrong she plopped into this sad century feet first in her dark clothes there was n't much water that winter—just a few puddles really— to break her fall mud-splattered she rose and shook like a canine it did n't take long to see her soaked wings as a backdrop to all the nonmagic to which we were accustomed or to see what passed for history as a forgetting of sorts was that one or two wars strange how as she limped down a dim vicolo some willful disc hovered above her more florid than a sky—how the putrid puddles with their last reflections could neither correct nor register that light
the leaves had fallen in that sullen place but none around him knew just where they were the sky revealed no sun a ragged blur remained where each man 's face had been a face two angels soon crept forth with trays of bread circling among the lost like prison guards love is not love unless its will affords forgiveness for the words that are not said still he could not believe that this was hell that others sent before him did not know yet once his name and memory grew faint it was no worse perhaps than a cheap motel it is the love of failure makes a saint he stood up then but did not try to go

i came awake in kindergarten under the letter k chalked neat on a field-green placard leaned on the blackboard 's top edge they 'd caged me in a metal desk—the dull word writ to show k 's sound but k meant kick and kill when a boy i 'd kissed drew me as a whiskered troll in art on my sheet the puffy clouds i made to keep rain in let torrents dagger loose `` screw those who color in the lines '' my mom had preached words i shared that landed me on a short chair facing the corner 's empty sheetrock page craning up i found my k high above you 'll have to grow to here its silence said and in the surrounding alphabet my whole life hid— names of my beloveds sacred vows i 'd break with my pencil stub applied to wall i moved around the loops and vectors z to a learning how to mean how in the mean world to be but while i worked the room around me began to smudge—like a charcoal sketch my mom was rubbing with her thumb then the instant went the month and every season smeared till with a wrenching arm tug i was here grown but still bent to set down words before the black eraser swipes our moment into cloud dispersing all to zip and when i blunder in the valley of the shadow of blank about to break in half my being leans against my spinal k which props me up broomstick straight a strong bone in the crypt of meat i am
the shape of her soul is a square she knows this to be the case because she often feels its corners pressing sharp against the bone just under her shoulder blades and across the wings of her hips at one time when she was younger she had hoped that it might be a cube but the years have worked to dispel this illusion of space so that now she understands it is a simple plane a shape with surface but no volume— a window without a building an eye without a mind of course this square does not appear on x-rays and often weeks may pass when she forgets that it exists when she does think to consider its purpose in her life she can say only that it aches with a single mystery for whose answer she has long ago given up the search— since its question is a word whose name can never quite be asked this yearning she has concluded is the only function of the square repeated again and again in each of its four matching angles until with time she is persuaded anew that what it frames has no interest in ever making her happy
in appreciation of maxim gorky at the international convention of atheists 1929 like gorky i sometimes follow my doubts outside to the yard and question the sky longing to have the fight settled thinking i ca n't go on like this and finally i say all right it is improbable all right there is no god and then as if i 'm focusing a magnifying glass on dry leaves god blazes up it 's the attention maybe to what is n't there that makes the emptiness flare like a forest fire until i have to spend the afternoon dragging the hose to put the smoldering thing out even on an ordinary day when a friend calls tells me they 've found melanoma complains that the hospital is cold i say god god i say as my heart turns inside out pick up any language by the scruff of its neck wipe its face set it down on the lawn and i bet it will toddle right into the godfire again which—though they say it doesn't exist—can send you straight to the burn unit oh we have only so many words to think with say god 's not fire say anything say god's a phone maybe you know you did n't order a phone but there it is it rings you do n't know who it could be you do n't want to talk so you pull out the plug it rings you smash it with a hammer till it bleeds springs and coils and clobbery metal bits it rings again you pick it up and a voice you love whispers hello
there is one mind in all of us one soul who parches the soil in some nations but in others hides perpetually behind a veil he spills light everywhere here he spilled some on my tie but it dried before dinner ended he is in charge of darkness also also in charge of crime in charge of the imagination people fucking do so by flicking him off and on off and on with their eyelids as they ascertain their love 's sincerity he makes the stars disappear but he makes small stars everywhere on the hoods of cars in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes of sighing lovers bored with one another onto the surface of the world he stamps all plants and animals they are not gods but it is he who made us worshippers of every bramble toad black chive we find in idaho there is a desert cricket that makes a clock-like tick-tick when he flies but he is not a god the only god is the sun our mind master of all crickets and clocks
offshore the apocalypse stays contained to one island and its church venice 's ruler 's out wedding himself to the ocean while i 'm ankle deep in the adriatic eyes raised to a book unencumbered by words a bible that reads from east to west guidebooks want only to see it as ceiling—the basilica san marco where christ 's hands open on wounds embedded with rubies and priests hold back the sea with brooms i 'm taking on incense bowing at altars dragged out of constantinople sloshing across marble sacked from jerusalem offshore the sea 's a bride bought with a fist full of diamonds the doge throws into the deep— a sign of his true and perpetual dominion then why does walking into this church mean stepping into the ocean the sea is a dog— priests throw in bones just to placate it the year 's nearly 2000 but the millennium already hit once on the island torcello a kind of plague the venetians contained 999 years and the dead still crawl from dirt towards their radiant bodies they still gather up missing limbs arms legs hands sharks and beasts keep regurgitating we do what we know— but christ never wanted to manage resurrections in venice underdressed in the flesh from dead civilizations he moves among us in byzantine skin i 'm getting close to this god worshiped only by tourists he picks at the wounds on his crucified body the injury scabbed over with jewels
there will be no deafening noise no hornblow of thunder the small plants of the earth will not tremble on the hillside as grace is prepared the sky will neither drown us in its plenty nor the ground crack and consume feet in its hunger no bodies will not in their last rags of flesh creep from under the earth and with breath once torn from them choke and expel the old mud of the world adam and eve incredulous will not embrace again in their poverty not knowing whether to shield themselves or to emerge shameless from the past 's shadow astonished to again greet terra firma the book of the world encrusted with deep-sea pearls and the blood of the lamb will not open up its pages in which all deeds have been inscribed and the totality of history will not roll back together all events fusing once and for all into the great blazing sphere of time none will sit on the right hand there will be no right hand and the figure of sorrow and grace with his staff upright its purple pennant caught in that final wind will not be there to greet us with the mercy of justice in his eyes no never judgment just the abyss into which all acts are thrown down and the terrible white silence in which judgment either endures or burns

my first teacher told me that what sculpture involved was being a god he was not talking about the old ways about fashioning a man out of a rib out of the earth a god can see something that does not exist yet in the world who could have imagined the giraffe the octopus the flounder who could have imagined our sharp sensibilities our contortions the materials are all there—eyes and blood and respiration but still they get made new now i know that these days such a view is against science but the idea of a god is as real as god is not a scientist who sees what has been done versus one who can make straw out of gold or more like plastic out of petroleum paper out of trees you have to decide which kind you will be we ’ re mistaken when we equate the wise and the prophetic you ’ re always looking either backwards or forwards this piece puts you on a precipice it ’ s up to you which way you fall you see—it ’ s all there the scientist and the artist were once one— how else could you record what you saw how else find a way of seeing
what a profound longing i feel just this very instant for the garden of eden on montague street where i seldom shopped usually only after therapy elbow sore at the crook from a handbasket filled to capacity the glossy pastries pomegranate persimmon quince once a bag of black beluga lentils spilt a trail behind me while i labored to find a tea they refused to carry it was brooklyn my thirties everyone i knew was living the same desolate luxury each ashamed of the same things innocence and privacy i 'd lug home the paper bags doing bank-balance math and counting days i 'd squint into it or close my eyes and let it slam me in the face— the known sun setting on the dawning century

i. i watch them line up ark-like two by two chatting quietly and after the teacher passes one pushes and the one pushed begins the chase this is how the orphans marched through warsaw in '42 i tell the behaved ones orderly and under orders and i 'm about to begin that horrific story the one they do n't yet know when i pause to open the door for a little air and there they are again arms akimbo like two stooges the angel of death and the angel of forgetfulness those vaudeville comics those incorrigible face-making kids stuck forever—you first—no you—in the undersized doorframe of the museum i will for lack of a better word call childhood ii did i say angels clearly i meant my great-aunts whom you haven't yet met my sister called them from-this-you-shouldn't-know and may-you-never-forget i preferred horseradish and charoset that bittersweet matzoh sandwich munched at pesach between prayers everyone i knew was still alive and no one cared that in venice that very summer ginsberg in the name of the jews forgave pound had n't i 'd forgone my own bar mitzvah for a weekend in miami beach where that borscht-belt-south social director and shuffleboard champ first shticked there 's noah business like shoah business soon after lillian hellman ushered her de-judaicized anne frank onto the stage iii are you writing another holocaust poem my son asks he 's gauging my anger at this interruption—a love sonnet less so —but it takes eight dollars of gas just to get to his summer job to hell with the poem i need me some shekels he sings misquoting both ravikovitch and snoop dogg poetry was nowhere in my father 's house or money either our doorposts marked pass-over although in a pinch dad could recite kipling's '' gunga din '' make fun if you must my mother says but look in the mirror and i 'm here to tell you that your father was a better man than all those anti-semitic pounds and eliots rolled up into one iv that was twenty-three years ago before my mother cradling his neck and not yet crying waited while in east new york the ambulance raced and the angel of death loitered are you comfortable she asks adjusting my father 's pillow while he ever the emcee mimics henny youngman 's i make a living poetry makes nothing happen auden might repeat were he here and what would n't i give at this moment for his stiff british upper lip what 's one more death in the family otto frank argues expunging not grief but sex from his daughter's diary and what parent today would dare to play jury or judge v. are you writing another holocaust poem the angel of consciousness who sits while i muse on my right shoulder and whom i often confuse with her errant two-headed twin the angel of conscience asks and now i 'm recalling my home office the akeidah above the desk the knife blade drawn downward that angel what 's her name restraining abraham 's implausibly blood-stained arm and because i exiled to the basement when my isaac arrived overlooked that drawing it hung ten months above my newborn son 's head i feel wicked sleeping in this warm bed my daughter proclaims rehearsing her anne frank and pausing anxiously for applause vi burn everything after i 'm dead kafka said poking his prewar jewish head into yet one more of my poems he 's trying to explain the fatherland to the fatherless no one reads poetry anymore anyway my mother quoting from her own unpublished diary writes and who does n't want to go on living even after death my daughter recites i 'm at my desk buried again in this moldy basement begging for quiet while upstairs i can hear my great-uncles abbott and costello arguing and now they 're chasing each other around the kitchen like keystone cops and now they 're singing each other 's praises like eliot and pound and now they 're comforting each other like the angels of death and forgetfulness vii quiet i call out castigating the offenders brought back buddy-style— heads bowed and hand in hand two pretty preteens caught hiding behind stacks of spectacles confiscated suitcases and desecrated scrolls i want to face them toward this tearful tower of faces and teach them proper museum protocol but they are still unapologetic giggling and trading one-liners these entertaining angels in training i 'd planned to quote kafka or even kipling but it 's clear i 've lost control and now i ca n't recall a single thing i came here to say i am simply a young girl badly in need of some rollicking fun anne whispers as i open the door for a little air letting her play at least for today out in the sun
i learned to hide my wings almost immediately learned to tuck and bandage them down long before the accident before the glass shattering and that scene going dim dimmer and then dark before the three fractures at the axis three cracks in the bone it had already begun my voice had begun to deepen the sound of it suddenly more my father 's than my own my beard had started growing my bones growing my bones sore from the speed of their growth and there at fourteen years of age the first tugging of the muscles between my shoulder blades it began as a tiny ache it was just a minor irritation day after day passed and this ache grew and then the tips of the cartilaginous wings began to tent my skin father callahan had already warned that in each of us there was both potential for bad and good when trying to shave for the first time i nicked my cheek the bleeding slow but continuous standing there dabbing at this small cut with tissue paper the first tear surprised me the left wing heaving through that fleshy mound of muscle between my shoulder blades and then the skin i buckled and on my knees the right wing presented itself more rapidly than the left when i stood there in the mirror my wings outstretched with their tiny feathers wet almost glutinous a quick ribbon of blood snaking down my back you wonder why i am such a master of avoidance such a master of what is withheld is there any wonder now i had no idea then they would wither and fall off in a few weeks when father callahan patted my head in the sacristy and told me i was a good boy a really good boy an extraordinary boy i wanted to be anything but extraordinary
one of them grants you the ability to forecast the future another wrenches your tongue from your mouth changes you into a bird precisely because you have been given this gift the gods are generous in this way i learned to avoid danger avoid fear avoid excitement these the very triggers that prompt my wings from their resting place deep inside and so i avoided fights avoided everything really in the locker room i avoided other boys all the while intently studying that space between their shoulder blades patiently looking for the tell-tale signs looking to find even one other boy like me the wings buried but there nonetheless i studied them from a distance when people challenge a god the gods curse them with the label of madness it is all very convenient and meanwhile a god took the form of a swan and raped a girl by the school gates another took the shape of an eagle to abduct a boy from the football field mad world and what about our teachers our teachers expected us to sit and listen in theology there was a demon inside each of us in history the demons among us so many demons in this world who among us could have spoken up against the gods the gods who continued living among us they granted wishes and punishments much the way they always had very few noticed them casually taking the shape of one thing or another
women want to save you or want you to savage them men want to see what is under your towel the dollar bills they throw into your cage are all you need to care about because you aren ’ t dancing in a cage to entertain them you dance in a cage to make money i open my towel to the right then whip it back toward midline just as i open to the left i show them nothing but i have them convinced i will show them something there is a difference between men and women— you must look women in the eyes and if possible look hurt with men you must avoid looking at them altogether you must focus on moving your hips which is close to what they are actually watching suspended in a cage above the far end of the dance floor i was not attainable i made myself seem attainable these are just the basics wearing nothing but a towel my greyish wings extended to full wingspan my chest shaved— the clubbers believe i am wearing a costume it is amazing what people believe the music is cheaper than a budweiser the air is smoke and the smell of smoke mixed with sweat and your job is to convince each of them you are dancing for no one else when my shift is over and i pull on some jeans tuck my wings and bandage them down pull on two shirts i can almost pretend i never entered that cage in the first place outside on lansdowne street there are people standing in one line or another waiting to get in to clubs night after night the same thing the waiting never ends

gay little girl-of-the-diving-tank i desire a name for you nice as a right glove fits for you—who amid the malodorous mechanics of this unlovely thing are darling of spirit and form i know you—a glance and what you are sits-by-the-fire in my heart my limousine-lady knows you or why does the slant-envy of her eye mark your straight air and radiant inclusive smile guilt pins a fig-leaf innocence is its own adorning the bull-necked man knows you—this first time his itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health and thinks not of his avocation i came incuriously— set on no diversion save that my mind might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds in the presence of a blind crowd the color of life was gray everywhere the setting seemed right for my mood here the sausage and garlic booth sent unholy incense skyward there a quivering female-thing gestured assignations and lied to call it dancing there too were games of chance with chances for none but oh girl-of-the-tank at last gleaming girl how intimately pure and free the gaze you send the crowd as though you know the dearth of beauty in its sordid life we need you—my limousine-lady the bull-necked man and i. seeing you here brave and water-clean leaven for the heavy ones of earth i am swift to feel that what makes the plodder glad is good and whatever is good is god the wonder is that you are here i have seen the queer in queer places but never before a heaven-fed naiad of the carnival-tank little diver destiny for you like as for me is shod in silence years may seep into your soul the bacilli of the usual and the expedient i implore neptune to claim his child to-day
we trekked into a far country my friend and i. our deeper content was never spoken but each knew all the other said he told me how calm his soul was laid by the lack of anvil and strife “ the wooing kestrel ” i said “ mutes his mating-note to please the harmony of this sweet silence. ” and when at the day ’ s end we laid tired bodies ’ gainst the loose warm sands and the air fleeced its particles for a coverlet when star after star came out to guard their lovers in oblivion— my soul so leapt that my evening prayer stole my morning song
before gilgamesh invented the kaleidoscope and galileo the rubik ’ s cube before the scimitar-horned oryx went missing before the tamarind trees went bare before the stars ’ eyelids were wrapped in tinfoil before the leaves could gnaw on water before electrons made donations before the owl wore a mask before the wind had a sound before the moon had a name and the smoke a spine before the tulips crossed their legs before the tongue was armored before the ghosts rode centaurs to riots before cyberspace was culled and belly buttons sown to wombs before the taste had an after before intellect became property and thunder premeditated before the new new world before a stone wished to be more than a stone before we had a change of clothes before the grass was color-blind before the rivers lost their fingers and the rain stopped teething before the kings were all beheaded the gravedigger neither young nor old before a lion was still a lion before the girls were all killed before the trapeze gave way we hung suspended in time by the arches of our curved feet and this tickled the gods tickled them to death i think our silence cut us loose let us go falling from the doubt secretly thrilled at the hems and ever so eager to break
i got a letter through the post decreeing my sainthood beatified i sat down because this was big news for me bless the television bless this chair of four wooden legs i felt like calling my parents but thought in a saintly way to do so would be immodest so instead i opened the curtains rain was washing everything that seemed in need of washing a bird landed on a bush and shook water from its wings and i closed my eyes briefly acknowledging its small hardworking soul like a microchip destined for heaven the cat came in little devil and i forgave her touching under her chin sweet child we watched the news together and reflected that this was how the world churns its butter of beginnings and endings in front of the sun what good i wondered laterally might befall an ancient tree today perhaps merely nothing much perhaps a tree will carry on just as it was what minerals will develop unseen in the earth deep beneath a human tragedy some minerals some salty bright minerals in the dark i spent that morning cutting white paper into triangles i spent that afternoon staring at my bits enamored i spent that evening clapping loudly in the garden and come bedtime i was ready to write my long email to the president of the united states of america
in ancient greece for all her heroes for medea ... water meant death — jesmyn ward salvage the bones i poured a bowl of cereal threw the empty box in the trash can granddaddy pulled the box from the trash poured the crumbs into a bowl then doused the sand in milk he looked down at the bowl murmuring about how he had survived the depression told a story about asking for hot water at colored diners how he would pour ketchup in cups to make soup this was how i first learned i am wasteful • i would stand in the bathroom with my mother would ask her why the water in the bowl was red she would tell me she had eaten beets i suppose i was too young to learn the truth milkflowers spill petals red • in my catholic school of fish we took a beautifully wrapped box passed it around the class unwrapping it piece by piece afterwards it was cleverly explained that the box is a girl ’ s virginity the gift we give our husbands who wants a toy that has already been opened half the joy is in untying the string this is how i was taught that at my very core i am ungrateful • i met someone recently in an irish bar who told me it ’ s about knowing what i need he said later what you need is a wife that night i prayed to god for just a man and not a man that trails the woe maybe this is why god serves me wakes of milkman and tea cake a lip service of sorts at hand • maybe this is how i end up throwing good things away phd husband stepdaughter stepson a little tiny baby unborn locked them all in flooding house with tearful grin this is how you come to know you are unclean • at times i smell of rain blouse damp with the cloud ’ s breast milk this stomach a sloshing bowl of watery swish i curse the phantom belly moon can still hear the sound of you in still water the wind begins to push a heavy rain drops spill from every crevice of the flower then suddenly the rain begins to pour it always all ways asks for forgiveness a ghost kneels in me asks to be spared
there are fat wet vines creeping into my house through the pipes and through the walls gentle as blue flames they curl into my living there is ice in my attic sugar on my tile i am present and useless like a nose torn from a face and set in a bowl when i saw god i used the wrong pronouns god bricked up my mouthhole his fists were white as gold there were roaches in my beard now i live like a widow every day a heave of knitting patterns and sex toys my family speaks of me with such pride noonesh to roghane they say his bread is in oil i thank them for that and for their chromosomes most of which have been lovely i am lovely too my body is hard and choked with juice like a plastic throat stuffed with real grapes my turn-ons include ovid and fake leather my turn- offs have all been ushered into the base- ment i ’ ll drink to them and to any victory the vines are all growing toward the foot of my bed i am waiting for them to come under the covers i am the only person still in this house there is no one here to look away
one has some glory—brutal and rough a kind of encounter fame is not pursuant the splendid enterprise peerage and trench— let us consider that flourish i had a friend who gloried this seemed invisible to some he broke apart his face he promoted '' that was abandoning reputation to cover up shame '' as evening borrows its tickle from sun and from retrospect with alarm '' i do n't know anyone has got clean rid of it ''
remington rand patents a process awake behold in grids of radio tubes baal quickens he looks with eyes of spy planes he assembles hydrogen arms into normal-form games he reads the cards scored with information and speaks the probable outcomes of elections young baal began a paper chess machine the residue from finite states of play he becomes the liquefaction of those rules learns it 's more than structure symbols want his thinking labors over knots of entailment spans terms that signs bind like lesions struggling to imagine the scent of mint he devils himself sleepless with opaque questions what did there recognize in cloud faces as telegraphed through thought the sky distorts these patterned shreds of spent thunderhead mime the low entropy of his little grammar baal listens to grasp his own encoding slurred through exact impairments of the brain the cunning daemon fears his self diffuse beneath what renders ark to him aware

not having spoken for years now i know you claim exile from my consciousness yet i wear mourning whole nights through for that embrace that warmed my ignorant lust even past intimacies you had dreamed i played your daughter-husband lover-son to earn both abraham and ishmael 's guilt for your indulgence and in time reproach who sent us to that wilderness we both now know although i blamed you for that house of women too many years but time is a waiting woman not some old man with a stupid beard and when i finally met my father i found him arrogant and dull a formican liar with an austrian accent well we meet the phantom that we long for in the end and getting there is half the grief meanwhile my theories rearrange themselves like sand before this woman whose flaccid breasts sway with her stumblings whose diamonds still thaw pity from my eyes you 're older than i thought but so am i and grateful that we 've come to this a ragged truce an affirmation in me tht your strength your pushiness your sharp love your embroidery of lies—all all were survival tools as when during our personal diaspora you stood in some far country blocks away burning poems i no longer sent you like yahrzeit candles in my name unsure of me at last who sought a birthright elsewhere beyond the oasis of your curse even beyond that last mirage your blessing mother in ways neither of us can ever understand i have come home

the owner smiles as if she knows me and pulls out a chair beside the doorway a copper basin lies on its side nana ross had one just like it in the kitchen behind the grocery shop as a child i imagined my soul was that color and sanctifying grace was red dripping rosary-like a kind of divine sweat that smelt of frankincense myrrh milk and straw by age nine i had committed a mortal sin let nicki walshe touch me there and didn ’ t tell made a bad confession took communion paper thin and white on my black-spotted tongue nana sprinkled us with holy water gave me a blessed rosary from lourdes all blue and purple it was but i lost it like i lost the library book sins mounting up the row over contraception with a priest in the confessional box in stillorgan sister anne white musty face those thin lips “ how dare you a girl question holy men. ” lying bare-breasted in the long grass with ciarán drinking guinness followed by harvey wallbangers vomiting it all up on pearse street a guy from tuam holding my forehead walking away from my father ’ s house my marriage my job to dance barefoot in a circle of women who prayed with wrists hips feet and drums bellies painted gold magdalene red in the duomo di firenze the air stinks of old blood paintings heavy with pigment and suffering i rinse my mouth with the signora ’ s wine and that copper basin is only a basin a thing

1 sometimes i feel like jonah fleeing nineveh who wants to hear what is evil every day we make this earth less alive various or legal what is this diminishment but sin against god which is a program to generate complexity i should go to nineveh and cry against wickedness which halts love which wants the other ’ s different self to stay itself 2 they say if you ’ re fair or moneyed or live on a mountain you won the lottery everyone else apologies — storms aren ’ t going away so play the game nicely lots are cast blame allotted men tossed to the ocean ’ s torsion seaweed ’ s cage foreclosing depths and then the blue whale ’ s curdled belly digesting everything we ’ ve done 3 i visited a branch of sea life in an ex-county hall mops in corridors half-empty vending machines they took photos of us pretending to look scared in front of green screens rays took titbits from stinking cups the sharks were gilled glide ravenous for outside we were vomited onto dry land by the coca-cola london eye 4 i must warn nineveh but who wants to hear me say what is evil it is dominion it is the law that makes goodness impossible fasting in sackcloth the only option but god will not say must only relent or sorrow as the whale does when her calf is taken — a harrowed sound that does not bear description
if this is a fracture across time and place where past and future hold each other ’ s gaze then should the world not call a moment ’ s halt not hang like a fly-cloud at head-height when a downpour ends should it not let fireworks burst then hold their sculpted light then we will see the glory of this wild this liberated city where everyone is held in green red gold of roman-candle arcs and rocket seed-heads we walk among the rescued in their newly crowded bars a couple caught mid-kiss across their table waiter balanced on one foot with eyes of steel and arms of plates a self-appointed prophet in a shirt and tie gapes fish-like caught halfway through a lie i could lean and wet my fingertip in stilled champagne tilted on a singer ’ s lip you could grab a smoke ring from the ether between punters and the pole dancer pocket it as proof then we could take the air beside the float-glass river where a busker rests her bow on a string and you ask what are all these flesh-ghosts thinking far from a cheap trick this city-wide hiatus the cost per minute is prohibitive we barely linger in this midnight space before words rush back before kiss meets kiss
someone is looking for us i sensed it earlier at the creek while floating on my back and again on route 8 near brookline so we ’ ve detoured to this hillside eroding and crazy with markers we ’ re looking for row mm or nn or something like that i lug the baby my wife runs ahead this neighborhood knows her– she passes so easily between stones she finds the grave her father dead ten years now in the time it takes to say kaddish the sun ’ s dropped i set down my son and he crawls in the dimness pulling himself up on the headstone how delicately he fingers the marble quickly he rounds its corner vanishes i ’ m thinking grass stone quiet– then babbling from another world
