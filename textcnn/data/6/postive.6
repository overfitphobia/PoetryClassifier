for michael coyle and donna frieze 1 you said anyone could walk in with a pack of explosives as we passed through the crowds of tourists and school kids — under the glass-grid ceiling lit with sun i was saying she ’ s our earth our body our sex as we drifted down the halls of statues and colonnades and hunks of facades of greek temples until we found room 22 “ the hellenistic world ” where a bronze face in a glass box on the wall stared back at us head from a bronze cult statue of anahita a local goddess in the guise of aphrodite 200–100 bc the text hung there in space — found in satala in ne asia minor armenia minor a left hand holding drapery was found with the head // and out of some bad comedy central joke my iphone buzzed with a flash news update about isis or isil or whatever they called themselves that week — temple of baalshamin at palmyra — blown up — the phrase re-circled — blown up — 2 and my head was back in the white van with the tv crew in ’ 09 winding through the buttes and roadside gullies of the syrian desert to the armenian memorial in der zor before we went to palmyra where i sat under 50-foot corinthian columns — the corners chipped by wind and sand in late may when it hit 110 at noon and the sun melted the plastic rim of my cell phone — as our driver appeared out of nowhere with stacks of zaatar bread and diet cokes — we found some shade under a portico as the visionary pillars disappeared into blue sky 3 outside students were buzzing through the gates of ucl and the brown brick of bloomsbury was lit up with sun after rain — inside the wunderkammer of hans sloane and the collectors who hauled their stuff from the middle east — what is the middle east my turkish publisher asked an audience at nyu — istanbul jerusalem mumbai srinagar you kept asking what is year zero to us didn ’ t our war destroy some temples and museums i called the curator on the phone at the info desk to leave my complaint on the message machine about the signage “ satala wasn ’ t armenia minor/ne asia minor — it was central armenia /anatolia — make correction. ” 4 what questions were we asking staring at the misinformation on the wall and the beautiful armenian head of anahit why was i back in der zor at the chapel digging armenian bones out of the baked ground — scratching the marrow and dried mildew 5 in the age of throat-slitting on twitter the imperial shock and awe of burning tigris — the lynching of saddam on the internet vanishing tomb of jonah — which fetishized objects ... whose museum 6 i ’ m gazing at the head of anahit — armenian goddess of fertility and love — no more local than the brooklyn bridge staring at the green and red paint still speckled on her bronze head i love her serpentine upper lip her eyes of black space — i stare into the screw hole in her neck the two curlicues of hair on her forehead her august throat her dense acanthine hair
for francisco x. alarcón rip it considers those men that ambled flushed their swords cut off the neck of the blue horses scraped off death dust from the carcass — rape of women tresses in boilers — the tin-colored animals on the viridian grasses in particular the howler monkey let the word shoot up to the spheres — later we charged our blood with these accounts we hid the arms unforgiving texts designs sewn into our tiny alabaster lockets we visited the last ridge where victor jara denounced the paramilitary — from la obrera in the heights of tijuana we sketched the reddish moon scratched poems those things that could carry the letters we hauled on our backs we were separated from something we could not describe yet we were in the totality in the long winding turquoise that broke us put us back together again what was that totality it could not be written — green moon green blood — we wrote we marched to the ends of lacanjá chansayab the heights of el colorín central méxico we were too late — the waters in which people bathed were cloudy malignant — bellies bloated children leaned on the twig house women stood up some sat cross- legged under the fire rays of noon — we knew they knew the rubble land was not theirs or ours it was stuffed into the cigarette packs of the ladino hacendados who kicked up their short boots in the city of bones below with our faces in new faces we rolled back to la do you change it do you leave it the same words — what are they a new cognition was required — then with the ecstasy of the unleashed other things pulled us apart other things reassembled us now we are here

careening over the highway in my lightweight japanese death star buffeted by the great and powerful winds icy winds of winter warming cold air with hot air under it accordion pleats of natural disaster my disaster in the past if you were to say to me or to rage at me in a poem about america i would charge you a great failure to even use the word it is banality this land is suffering because poets— their great cohort— i look twice to save lives
one thing i ’ m not doing in my poems reporting on anything that really happened when i say i ’ m from new york glaswegians say “ oh i love woody allen. ” they can not construe how large a state can be i just happen to actually be from manhattan how impractical to imagine that a structure like a government would be responsive to the needs of such a lot of people held like in a holding pen in the early 1990s i saw a yellow indian drunk in a tattoo parlor in seattle he literally said he could literally see right through me if he said it figuratively i took it literally a lot of people in america do not want regulation from the government in principle our forefathers our persecution ideally we wouldn ’ t need industries and individual actions to be regulated we wouldn ’ t even need laws people including people who run corporations or work for them would just behave responsibly corporations would take the responsibility of personhood seriously my mother can not be trusted to restrict me from buying r-rated videogames at the porn store my mother struggled to love me—the firstborn had been so tractable—she still struggles to love me—can she be commanded to love me now i see what those commandments are about there must be a god objectively we could expect that our family members would go out of their way to behave toward us with extra care concern and with love sometimes there is a harsh disjunction between what objective perception would suggest to us we might expect and what really takes place or “ occurs ” within the framework of what we call “ our lives. ” i really saw the other day for the first time that my mother did not naturally take to me—i am not much like her it would take an effort for her to understand what matters to me her love will come around my own daughter is quite different from me—i think—it ’ s hard to tell she is only five years old but she looks different—takes after her father as i took after mine—and so far her concerns are not my own she loves pink i hate pink my love moves faster where would that moral activity come from to behave responsibly toward others not to overcharge not to seek loopholes not to dominate not to oppress does anyone consciously oppress i guess some spousal abuse comes from the pure urge to dominate and the ire that results when that domination is resisted or thwarted but is it a pure urge or is it coming from an inscribed narrative of gendered hierarchy like a man wearing a wife-beater has been told too many times that his wife is supposed to listen to him and obey him now if he can be told by the government that “ my strength is not for hurting ” a local billboard campaign maybe that will ring in his ears when he lifts his fist if the government doesn ’ t do it who will do it the church used to do it and still does the one time i went to church with my mother in tennessee when we were at a family reunion and the whole family had certain activities and one of them was “ church on sunday ” i was brought to tears by the simple goodness of the message that the pastor or reverend —minister —this was a methodist church—was preaching it was father ’ s day actually and he talked about how fathers ought to make sure to spend time with their kids turn off the tv he said and spend some time with your kids i was crying because i am not used to an experience of shared instruction in goodness it was very moving to be in a room with real people all receiving the same instruction
it takes more than a wish to catch a fish you take the hook you add the bait you concentrate and then you wait you wait you wait but not a bite the fish don ’ t have an appetite so tell them what good bait you ’ ve got and how your bait can hit the spot this works a whole lot better than a wish if you really want to catch a fish

halfway between crib and cage the french language puts crate a simple slatted box for transporting those fruits that fall ill at the least lack of air built in such a way that it can be broken down effortlessly after use it is never used twice it is really more perishable than the deliquescing foodstuffs that it carries on the corners of streets that lead to the markets it gleams like white wood without wood ’ s vanity still very new and slightly surprised to find itself in this awkward position having been thrown into the gutter without hope of retrieval it remains a most likable object on whose fate we will not dwell for long translated from the french

it ’ s not so easy to smash the compass to rely on the winds the golden hum of herb kane clouds navigating the tips of these mountains it ’ s not so easy to modify the compass to apologize when your brothers are spreading the sashimi and churning the shoyu mustard it ’ s not so easy to ignore the compass because it seems to have always been here in all its sextant glory pointing distracting you from wākea ’ s blue teeth nibbling papa ’ s chest it ’ s not so easy but it ’ s possible to say “ aloha for now ” to family and friends pouring bags of ice into clean coolers before the big show to walk past uncle ’ s squid lū ‘ au bubbling green to get in that car and drive with nothing but a fistful of quarters for the library xerox machine it ’ s possible because when those books slide across the counter and you walk to an empty table the compass begins to shake and the needle is never the same again with every turn of a pacific page you realize pukas are being filled or new ones uncovered and the art of listening brings with it memories of the physics of his hips and hands when you first saw him cast that net slicing the horizon the needle doesn ’ t like it when you flatten the cube to discover your kūpuna were always just around the corner from where you sit now and the halftime show hasn ’ t even started yet the time it takes to get from the third million-dollar commercial to the fifth is equal to the time it takes to find the kānaka maoli name of the land that raised you buried under the pavements under the brand new two-lane fast food drive-thru but what the compass really hates what it ’ s really afraid of is when you see the lo ‘ i in the same way that you see that empty sunday afternoon library when you finally see the moana in your kūpuna ’ s eye so now when you return home and the cooler is empty and the sashimi spiral is nearly gone unfurl those xerox copies across the dining table consoling the cousins who lost money on the spread and as the compass repairs itself as it always does it will feel the sting when it finds you tomorrow with your back being warmed by the morning sun
i carry my spikes and step on the field an hour ahead of the others last day of march with april offering tickets for the new season i 'm full of sun on wet grass in love with blistered benches a sparrow sits on the backstop watching ready to dart if i catch its eye i drop my bag on home plate and swirl my foot in the dust the way my cousin does with his fingers on the skin of a drum head next year he 'll be released with the others who spent mornings breaking windows and trashing vacation homes like drunks in the right field bleachers here i 'm alone with a sparrow and the smell of a baseball morning settling around me like a comforter i start trotting to first base the ankles loosening then the knees as the dust begins to lift into the breaking light around second and third i stretch my arms in a rotary motion ready to fly a hand waves back from a passing car someone who knows me or remembers rising one morning when the game of who you are is played out in your mind and around you a stadium full of fans begs you to do what you usually do in the clutch the bat i pull from the bag for the first time is my father's louisville slugger thirty-three inches wood barrel i thought enough time had passed the attic dust hard in the grooves i stroke it slowly like a weapon you love to touch but would never use he hit .304 at omaha the season he was drafted all-star rookie-of-the-year he said we 'd join him soon then that other draft he would have been here i swear he would the silence feels oppressive now i dig for a scuffed ball and throw it up shoulder high but let it fall a natural hitter my father said holding my hands i grip the tar-stained handle tears blur the wall that 's so far away it looks warped i aim for marrow deep inside april hungry for the kill

no woman wants to be low-hanging fruit my glamorous girlfriend says but i ’ m indiscriminate and love all fruit i ’ m tempted to list each kind right here in and out of season because even just saying the names gives me pleasure as does saying your name i ’ m not alone with my passion — my whole family we ’ re a little off in this regard we can spend hours talking about cantaloupe or arguing over how many flats to buy when it ’ s peach-o-rama at the metropolitan once i even drove half a day to get to pence orchards where i met and took photos of bert pence who sold me three boxes of peaches at wholesale prices he was so good to me as was the late-summer freestone i picked as i walked back through the orchard in the august heat to the entrance gates which were nothing like the gates of hell on the contrary i was in heaven there in yakima i can still smell that single peach which was profusely low-hanging it was the definition of low-hanging it fell into my hands as you did — or perhaps as i did into yours — but that was months ago when i walked past the stands yesterday on what should have been the first day of spring all produce had been covered with heavy blankets to keep it warm to mitigate harm today the temperature dropped so low someone thought to remove the fruit entirely and stash it away with this strange weather we ’ re having will i see you again i can ’ t help myself

el patio de mi casa 1990 by maría brito my patio was once a schoolyard or maybe a barracoon perhaps both the ghosts of children nest under the pink sink mouths agape for flakes of rust or they creep to the ceiling sucking on the five taps of blue water their little lips abuzz like cicadas in the moonlight i see them bounce on my feather bed bowed like an old donkey ’ s back or they teeter-totter in my wicker chair darned with burlap string leave them alone i say to my mother who wants to cleanse the house with carvacrol trapping these children ’ s souls in beehives then stringing them up with kites so they fly to the moon let them drum our dented pots let them screech happy carols let them dance with tin spurs on their little feet mother i don ’ t care if they nibble our family photos soil your heirlooms of lace or steal what few grains of rice more like gypsum ants you hoard in the pink pantry let them play cat ’ s cradle with spiderwebs let them rummage in your armoire of moths let them lurk in your shadows of ill will tease you to laughter ghosts are unruly free to be fickle unlike me the pig-tailed girl you kept strapped to the sewing machine in the shed of planks by the mango tree too old to fruit work sweat will set you free you said just like fidel on the radio cut me out of those sepia photos on the wall burn those baby braids you keep in porcelain toss my first communion gown into the sea i wish i ’ d been born into a brood of mice quick to grow quick to breed quick to die among the kapok trees

—zelda fitzgerald 1939 dear one do you have the time can you take the time can you make the time to visit me the hospital doors have opened to spring and its land is high dear one each slope with a vapor of crocuses its citizens alas are low despondent in fact though a jar of sun tea tans on the sill the woman beside me has opened the gift of a china doll an antique frozen charlotte glass face a cap of china hair shellacked to the sheen of a chestnut at breakfast the shifting returned dreadful within me colors were infinite part of the air lines were free of the masses they held the melon a cloud and the melon an empty oval lariat they have moved the canvas chair from the window sun enhanced by the brewing jar threw an apricot scorch on the fabric the fruit a cloud the fruit a doll-sized empty lariat d. o. into what shape will our shaplessness flow dear one italian escapes me still i float to the operas of hasse and handel a word now and then lifting through sole libertà in an earlier time the thrum-plumped voice of a countertenor—half male half female—might place him among us we who are thickened by fracturings d. o. now and then my words break free of the masses they hold think of wind how it barks through the reeds of a dog 's throat how the pungent meaty stream of it cracks into something like words—but not i just sit in the sun room then slumped in my fur and slabber feeling the wolf begin back away then some great-jawed prehistoric other begin back away then the gill-less the gilled then the first pulsed flecks begin back away until only a wind remains vast and seamless no earth no heavens no rise no dip no single flash of syllable that might be me or you d. o. now a gauze of snow on the crocuses i woke to its first brilliance—midnight great moon— and walked through the hallways the pin-shaped leaves of the potted cosmos threw a netted shadow and i stopped in its fragile harmony my arms bare feet the folds of my limp gown striped by such weightless symmetry i might have been myself again through an open screen door i saw a patient drawn out by the brightness perhaps her naked body a ghastly white her face a ghastly frozen white fixed in a bow-mouthed syncope like something out of time as we are d. o. here in the highland time 's infinite cyclic now-and-then one simple flake of consciousness against the heated tongue dear one my italian improves sole libertà and dio of course d. o. although he has forsaken me the tea at the window gleams like the flank of a chestnut horse it darkens imperceptibly as madness does or dusk all morning i held a length of cotton twine— a shaggy oakum filament— between the jar and brewing sun we made a budding universe the solar disc the glassy globe of reddish sea the stillness in the firmament at last across the cotton twine a smoke began a little ashless burn dio that flared and died so suddenly its light has yet to reach me

for asja in predawn dark a rat falling from a rafter is a dollop wind a whir and suddenly i 'm remembering my mother teaching me to bake her hot water sponge cake how we whipped the egg whites with the electric mixer until stiff peaks formed how she warned me not to allow a single thread of yolk to taint the white or the cake would fail to fold white into yolk-sugar-flour was slow patient she let me carve a wedge with the rubber spatula drop it to the batter 's surface then lift from the bowl 's bottom up and over the dollop turning it in warned me never to beat or mix or even stir—the cake would fall once dinking around i stuck a wooden spoon into the still-whirring beaters bent the metal splintered the spoon into the batter once i cut her grandmother 's precious lace for a doll 's clothes and she cried the savaged pieces draped across her wrists so many times i tried to shove my peasant feet into her dainty pumps hand into her evening gloves one spoon at a time that first thin layer drawn across the airy white forming a little hill folding only just enough the batter growing lighter by increments it was mostly space we folded in taming down the cloy it was never so good as then licked off the finer the cake itself to me disappointing layers smeared with homemade jam topped with a stiff merengue never so good as then her instructing trying to domesticate my impertinence teach me a little grace me resisting the sweet on my tongue dissolving so easily in that state of matter never so good as straight from the pyrex bowl never so gentle as the slide of batter into an angel food pan the rest up to her what she created from the baked version brown on top and bottom here i am decades later sitting uner the halogen of a full moon and that moment which was many folded into one is so pure and specific the sugar sharp on my tongue the spatula pushing as if through an undertow my mother taught me to fold never so sweet as now we were incorporating lightness into a deep bowl as some bird—probably an owl out hunting—chacks its was across the lawn sounding like a key chain and now the garden sprinkler comes on so i know it 's 6:00 a.m. there 's the first hint of dawn slow-dissolving one more night this is a fifty- year-old love it 's heavy so i fold in moonlight the sound of water spattered on leaves dim stars bright moon— our lives the cake imperfect but finished —12.17.2013
inside the night this hospital asylum this party for those undone by desire forever unslaked inside a house inside the night i 'm inside this house with eight beams and moonlight pulling on the past through skylights this house of white noise wind and dry heat lonely house on a ridge line house of ordinary shame my sister 's house with corrals and outbuildings around it and beyond that the dog patrolling and beyond that skirts and folds of the mountain rising in rumpled geologic scrolls into the range at the center beneath the moon 's silence that nothing ever changes muffled in blankets with fear beside me on my little bench of sleep i can hear their voices could be three or twenty-three unhinged saints gabbling to their shadows or panty-sniffers drug-trippers in all flavors past vanilla could be birnam wood on the move the shriek of its roots thirsty and air-brushed or a pack of lunatics crooning norteño songs what is certain is advent they 're coming down coming towards the heart beneath the feathers coming for what ca n't be protected on a beam of dread riding that ray i 'm listening my eyes snapped-open inside darkness other people in other rooms who know how to sleep through a night like this night thrown against the roundness of the world which is desire the old bitch guards this night on the ranch half shepherd half other this is her watch she gallops the perimeter anxious to sound like more than one dog though she 's going arthritic and her paws strike the hard ground now they quiet penitents lunatics marauders and ragpickers quiet only one left behind and the moon is his hieroglyph one creature padding down the mountain coming closer coyote knows a good joke he only wants to let her in on it he ca n't stop laughing ca n't stop crying ca n't stop licking the crevices clean licking safety and duty until they 're empty i hear the dog listening ears lifted coyote 's tongue slides into night air pressing narcotic vowels through wonder through longing and longing and wonder awaken she 's close to that edge that border in the night where one thing becomes another and even an old dog who 's worked a ranch eleven years feels the urge to let loose blow this little settlement go wild clouds loose and blue in the arms of the moon slant light on this mountain raking us the dog and i we feel the pull imagine a woman trying to come between coyote and the female he 's after when she knows what is dark and offers itself and vanishes has come for her at last the body wants what it ca n't have to follow the path of thirst through the rent in the wire beyond the corral the dog does n't move but who knows better than she the small outpost death has set up in her maybe she 's all desire now to slip under the moon and chase down that lure coyote wheedles and croons another minute or two then lopes off calling over his shoulder in a language even i can understand the right names for things not kept in heaven
after kees `` travels in north america '' 1. santa fe '' the walls are old '' he says i turn in the plaza and nod to weldon kees his face as dark as the cool shadows that surround us walls keeping him safe honoring his silence though he comes to me to be led away `` the mountains out there are not old '' he claims and slips his hands into his coat we cross the street each indian blanket on the ground holding jewelry i would love to touch but kees and the navajo man selling his crafts are whispering to the ground kees surprises me by entering the museum of arts i follow him the stone floor ringing with our footsteps empty arches blending above kees stops and turns to me `` one can see only so much '' he says he leads me to the twisted dwarf the tangles form of faith and death arrows bristling from its muscled body a sacrifice of the ugly encased in glass kees staring at the sculpture as if he knows why we really ca n't see it he points to the deepest arrow and places a hand on my shoulder `` when you believe this you are home '' he tells me and walks out 2. albuquerque the sangre de cristo mountains are old and he is driving my car to the highest ridge the valley below avoiding the bright moon the same white light in the bay kees wanted to touch before he left `` mist and clouds are a lie '' he claims `` look down there men are running away '' he drives slowly to the top and we get out the autumn sun burning terraces into scrub cedars and piñon pines he wrote about when he crossed here long ago standing on the edge of the cliff as if this is the only way for him to go `` look past what you want to see '' he sighs as the wind takes his slick hair and makes him into someone i have seen before the streets of albuquerque down there as dusty as his closed eyes we stand on the edge and i wait at this elevation with kees who wrote that the towns we will not visit are places where home truly lies `` i must go '' he decides `` where to '' i ask `` anyplace you have n't seen '' he says and walks down the mountain 3. tyuonyi kees and i are happy when the sun splits the tree for a moment because yesterday controlled this mountain dawn burning mud deeper into the adobe cottonwoods catch fire here give the people time to hide inside turtle shells though they come out to watch us i stop as the drawings come to life under the arches symbols familiar to those who sleep by crossing the street each night as i stare i realize a man who diappears wants to understand and not hide yet the designs tempt me to walk in the wrong direction and leave him behind to go farther up would mean a canyon where i have been a dirt street inside another path tiny houses falling back letting me pass beyond their locked doors as if the smoking windows know where i must go when i enter the placita the old woman is not there because this is about bringing kees back the dirt street opens to the last scorched tree breaking out of walls to shade what ca n't be blessed its branches confusing until their cracks enter the ground in search of peace 4. santa maria water disappears to settle as clear glass that contains memories of thirst the ancient hole found in the ruins kees hand keeping the others from skimming the surface of the still water reaching to be alone under the mountain wall though eyes that watch have seen this before men entering and never coming out one hand keeps the other from touching the surface pulling back allows the echo of falling rocks the deep swimmer breaking through walls to emerge on the other side of the well where the first figures to emerge in centuries are sitting and rubbing sand over their wet shivering bodies 5. fort selden kees is getting tired in the desert heat and sits on a historic slab of western settlement this old fort a museum where thirsty men come to drink from the bitter well kees smokes too many cigarettes and shakes his head at me '' look at the moth and the deep iris in your garden because the equation i found in san francisco is an eclipse drawn on paper by my trembling hands '' he pauses and takes a drag my head bathed in sweat and confusion as he coughs this '' it is too late because jazz has gone away i placed a stone deity of a bird next to an eggplant on my desk its smooth purple skin as significant as the gathering of birds in your head their chirping coming from sorrow even from the bay where i never told a lie though the grand steps lead to the burned church where the musicians used to trace my forehead '' i stare at him and he tosses smoke on the ground because we are close to home 6. el paso kees waits at the bus station in my hometown we can not go farther because the border here is out there and as violent as the reasons he disappeared in san francisco a long time ago i want to tell him who i think he is but i grew up here and must hide how things have really been drawing the light off the mountains as if the doubters of history are simply starving boys offering to shine kees' shoes on the corner of paisano street my hometown has a bridge but kees wo n't go near it because he says to cross it would be to admit there is something wrong on the other side of my family 's house he can never cross because we have found our way here el paso dreaming its population of mute men must keep growing because the border keeps taking too many of them away kees looks at the bus schedule runs out of cigarettes and everything is closed he nods at nothing and waits on the bench with someone he swears looks like me
when i was a boy he says the sky began burning someone ran knocking on our door one night the house became birds in the eaves too low for a boy 's ears i heard a girl talking but they were n't words i knew one good thing a girl was somewhere in our house speaking slow as a sailor 's parrot i glimpsed alice in wonderland her voice smelled like an orange though i 'd never peeled an orange i knocked on the walls in a circle the voice was almost america my ears plucked a word out of the air she said friend i eased open the door hidden behind overcoats in a closet the young woman was smiling at me she was teaching herself a language to take her far far away she taught me a word each day to keep secret but one night i woke to other voices in the house a commotion downstairs a pleading there are promises made at night that turn into stones at daybreak from my window i saw the stars burning in the river brighter than a big celebration i waited for her return with my hands over my mouth i ca n't say her name because it was dangerous in our house so close to the water was she a boy 's make-believe friend or a beehive breathing inside the walls years later my aunts said two german soldiers shot the girl one night beside the vistula this is how i learned your language it was long ago it was springtime
i 've come to this one grassy hill in ramallah off tokyo street to a place a few red anemones a sheaf of wheat on darwish 's grave a borrowed line transported me beneath a babylonian moon i found myself lucky to have the shadow of a coat as warmth listening to a poet 's song of jerusalem the hum of a red string caesar stole off gilgamesh 's lute i know a prison of sunlight on the skin the land i come from they also dreamt before they arrived in towering ships battered by the hard atlantic winds crows followed me from my home my coyote heart is an old runagate redskin a noble savage still lakota i knew the bow before the arch i feel the wildflowers all the grasses insects singing to me my sacred dead is the dust of restless plains i come from i love when it gets into my eyes mouth telling me of the roads behind ahead i go back to broken treaties smallpox the irony of barbed wire your envoy could be a reprobate whose inheritance is no more than a swig of firewater the sun made a temple of the bones of my tribe i know a dried-up riverbed extinct animals live in your nightmares sharp as shark teeth from my mountains strung into this brave necklace around my neck i hear chief standing bear saying to judge dundy `` i am a man '' now i know why i 'd rather die a poet than a warrior tattoo tomahawk
if i am not ulysses i am his dear ruthless half brother strap me to the mast so i may endure night sirens singing my birth when water broke into a thousand blossoms in a landlocked town of the south before my name was heard in the womb-shaped world of deep sonorous waters storms ran my ship to the brink i was n't myself in a kingdom of unnamed animals totem trees but never wished to unsay my vows from the salt-crusted timbers i could only raise a battering ram or cross where i learned god is rhythm spores if i am ulysses made of his words deeds i swam with sea cows mermaids in a lost season ate oysters poison berries to approach the idea of death tangled in the lifeline 's slack on that rolling barrel of a ship then come home to more than just the smell of apples the heavy oars creaking the same music as our bed
when the trees were guilty hugged up to history locked in a cross-brace with whitman 's louisiana live oak you went into that mossy weather did you witness the shotguns at angola riding on horseback through the tall sway of sugarcane the glint of blue steel in the bloodred strawberry fields silence was backed up in the cypress but you could hear the birds of woe singing praise where the almost broken- through sorrow rose from the deep woods walked out into moonshine as the brave ones you went among those who had half a voice whose ancestors mastered quicksand by disappearing maybe our paths crossed ghosts hogtied in the wounded night but it is only now i say this galway thanks for going down into our fierce hush at the crossroads to look fear in the eye
the volcano in my grandmother 's mexican village smothered the town though the girl escaped because the axis of revolution sent her family into exile black clouds covering their journey to the north the axis of the earth is a skeletal bone extending from pole to pole the arm of someone holding on the japanese earthquake shifted the axis of the earth moving japan twelve feet closer to north america each day shortened by one second when a poet said the past never happens because it is always present the other one proclaimed the past is in the future the axis bending to allow these words to skip the water like stones thrown by a boy in search of his father the axis of yesterday sinking the stones the boy hurled across the pond
they call the mountain carlos because it is brown though its purple slopes at dusk suggest other names those who name it have to brand the earth with something they know— a name a face even the heat that says '' i know carlos and he is the mountain i am going to cover his eyes in light '' they call its peak carlos because it is the sharpest feature on the face that stares south watching people cross the border pausing to catch their breath and meet the cliffs of carlos because he is there when they ascend the canyons inside the face carlos shifts and the climbers discover what he has done the moving earth changes everything and they are forced to stop playing the game of naming a mountain that keeps touching the sun

already his abdomen was sculpted and already the thin trail descending from beneath his belly button even now it is difficult to explain it i was after all only 7 i did n't even know what turkish meant in the dead of winter which only meant certain flowers had ceased blooming on the island we had driven up into the mountains to `` take the waters '' as our parents put it our parents instructions were simple they would be in one room our sister in another my brother and i in yet another down the dark hallways as dark as tunnels down through the strong smell of minerals and seawater the attendants led us to our rooms what was that smell sulfur aluminum there was the smell of salt but it was not the salt of the earth not the sea itself the old man told us not to sit in the water for more than fifteen minutes at a time to drink lots of cold water to scrub the salts into our skin to take care of each other and then he left us we took off our clothes did it without thinking `` you get in first '' is all he said his voice sounding more like my father 's his voice having changed almost a year ago his body had changed too sitting in the pool my thoughts began to swim in the vapors the steam i felt nauseated i wanted not to look at him i wanted to look at the tile blue and blue-white with the depiction of a terrible vine twisting and creeping around the tops of the walls when he got out and lay on the tile next to the pool his abdomen was already sculpted and the thin trail he knew i watched him and he loved the admiration when i finally got out my head dizzy my heart racing from the heat i lay myself down next to him he scrubbed my back with a rough sponge pulled me against his chest as he scrubbed behind my ears and under my arms there in the steam i was cleaner than i would ever be again
if i told you earl the toughest kid on my block in north philadelphia bow-legged and ominous could beat any man or woman in ten moves playing white or that he traveled to yugoslavia to frustrate the bearded masters at the belgrade chess association you 'd think i was given to hyperbole and if at dinnertime i took you into the faint light of his section 8 home reeking of onions liver and gravy his six little brothers fighting on a broken love-seat for room in front of a cracked flat-screen one whose diaper sags it 's a wonder it has n't fallen to his ankles the walls behind doors exposing the sheetrock the perfect o of a handle and the slats of stairs missing where baby-boy gets stuck trying to ascend to a dominion foreign to you and me with its loud timbales and drums blasting down from the closed room of his cousin whose mother stands on a corner on the other side of town all times of day and night except when her relief check arrives at the beginning of the month you 'd get a better picture of earl 's ferocity after-school on the board in mr. sherman 's class but not necessarily when he stands near you at a downtown bus-stop in a jacket a size too small hunching his shoulders around his ears as you imagine the checkered squares of his poverty and anger and pray he does not turn his precise gaze too long in your direction for fear he blames you and proceeds to take your queen

friends will you bear with me today for i have awakened from a dream in which a robin made with its shabby wings a kind of veil behind which it shimmied and stomped something from the south of spain its breast aflare looking me dead in the eye from the branch that grew into my window coochie-cooing my chin the bird shuffling its little talons left then right while the leaves bristled against the plaster wall two of them drifting onto my blanket while the bird opened and closed its wings like a matador giving up on murder jutting its beak turning a circle and flashing again the ruddy bombast of its breast by which i knew upon waking it was telling me in no uncertain terms to bellow forth the tubas and sousaphones the whole rusty brass band of gratitude not quite dormant in my belly— it said so in a human voice “ bellow forth ” — and who among us could ignore such odd and precise counsel hear ye hear ye i am here to holler that i have hauled tons—by which i don ’ t mean lots i mean tons — of cowshit and stood ankle deep in swales of maggots swirling the spent beer grains the brewery man was good enough to dump off holding his nose for they smell very bad but make the compost writhe giddy and lick its lips twirling dung with my pitchfork again and again with hundreds and hundreds of other people we dreamt an orchard this way furrowing our brows and hauling our wheelbarrows and sweating through our shirts and two years later there was a party at which trees were sunk into the well-fed earth one of which a liberty apple after being watered in was tamped by a baby barefoot with a bow hanging in her hair biting her lip in her joyous work and friends this is the realest place i know it makes me squirm like a worm i am so grateful you could ride your bike there or roller skate or catch the bus there is a fence and a gate twisted by hand there is a fig tree taller than you in indiana it will make you gasp it might make you want to stay alive even thank you and thank you for not taking my pal when the engine of his mind dragged him to swig fistfuls of xanax and a bottle or two of booze and thank you for taking my father a few years after his own father went down thank you mercy mercy thank you for not smoking meth with your mother oh thank you thank you for leaving and for coming back and thank you for what inside my friends ’ love bursts like a throng of roadside goldenrod gleaming into the world likely hauling a shovel with her like one named aralee ought with hands big as a horse ’ s and who like one named aralee ought will laugh time to time til the juice runs from her nose oh thank you for the way a small thing ’ s wail makes the milk or what once was milk in us gather into horses huckle-buckling across a field and thank you friends when last spring the hyacinth bells rang and the crocuses flaunted their upturned skirts and a quiet roved the beehive which when i entered were snugged two or three dead fist-sized clutches of bees between the frames almost clinging to one another this one ’ s tiny head pushed into another ’ s tiny wing one ’ s forelegs resting on another ’ s face the translucent paper of their wings fluttering beneath my breath and when a few dropped to the frames beneath honey and after falling down to cry everything ’ s glacial shine and thank you too and thanks for the corduroy couch i have put you on put your feet up here ’ s a light blanket a pillow dear one for i can feel this is going to be long i can ’ t stop my gratitude which includes dear reader you for staying here with me for moving your lips just so as i speak here is a cup of tea i have spooned honey into it and thank you the tiny bee ’ s shadow perusing these words as i write them and the way my love talks quietly when in the hive so quietly in fact you can not hear her but only notice barely her lips moving in conversation thank you what does not scare her in me but makes her reach my way thank you the love she is which hurts sometimes and the time she misremembered elephants in one of my poems which oh here they come garlanded with morning glory and wisteria blooms trombones all the way down to the river thank you the quiet in which the river bends around the elephant ’ s solemn trunk polishing stones floating on its gentle back the flock of geese flying overhead and to the quick and gentle flocking of men to the old lady falling down on the corner of fairmount and 18th holding patiently with the softest parts of their hands her cane and purple hat gathering for her the contents of her purse and touching her shoulder and elbow thank you the cockeyed court on which in a half-court 3 vs. 3 we oldheads made of some runny-nosed kids a shambles and the 61-year-old after flipping a reverse lay-up off a back door cut from my no-look pass to seal the game ripped off his shirt and threw punches at the gods and hollered at the kids to admire the pacemaker ’ s scar grinning across his chest thank you the glad accordion ’ s wheeze in the chest thank you the bagpipes thank you to the woman barefoot in a gaudy dress for stopping her car in the middle of the road and the tractor trailer behind her and the van behind it whisking a turtle off the road thank you god of gaudy thank you paisley panties thank you the organ up my dress thank you the sheer dress you wore kneeling in my dream at the creek ’ s edge and the light swimming through it the koi kissing halos into the glassy air the room in my mind with the blinds drawn where we nearly injure each other crawling into the shawl of the other ’ s body thank you for saying it plain fuck each other dumb and you again you for the true kindness it has been for you to remain awake with me like this nodding time to time and making that noise which i take to mean yes or i understand or please go on but not too long or why are you spitting so much or easy tiger hands to yourself i am excitable i am sorry i am grateful i just want us to be friends now forever take this bowl of blackberries from the garden the sun has made them warm i picked them just for you i promise i will try to stay on my side of the couch and thank you the baggie of dreadlocks i found in a drawer while washing and folding the clothes of our murdered friend the photo in which his arm slung around the sign to “ the trail of silences ” thank you the way before he died he held his hands open to us for coming back in a waft of incense or in the shape of a boy in another city looking from between his mother ’ s legs or disappearing into the stacks after brushing by for moseying back in dreams where seeing us lost and scared he put his hand on our shoulders and pointed us to the temple across town and thank you to the man all night long hosing a mist on his early-bloomed peach tree so that the hard frost not waste the crop the ice in his beard and the ghosts lifting from him when the warming sun told him sleep now thank you the ancestor who loved you before she knew you by smuggling seeds into her braid for the long journey who loved you before he knew you by putting a walnut tree in the ground who loved you before she knew you by not slaughtering the land thank you who did not bulldoze the ancient grove of dates and olives who sailed his keys into the ocean and walked softly home who did not fire who did not plunge the head into the toilet who said stop don ’ t do that who lifted some broken someone up who volunteered the way a plant birthed of the reseeding plant is called a volunteer like the plum tree that marched beside the raised bed in my garden like the arugula that marched itself between the blueberries nary a bayonet nary an army nary a nation which usage of the word volunteer familiar to gardeners the wide world made my pal shout “ oh ” and dance and plunge his knuckles into the lush soil before gobbling two strawberries and digging a song from his guitar made of wood from a tree someone planted thank you thank you zinnia and gooseberry rudbeckia and pawpaw ashmead ’ s kernel cockscomb and scarlet runner feverfew and lemonbalm thank you knitbone and sweetgrass and sunchoke and false indigo whose petals stammered apart by bumblebees good lord please give me a minute ... and moonglow and catkin and crookneck and painted tongue and seedpod and johnny jump-up thank you what in us rackets glad what gladrackets us and thank you too this knuckleheaded heart this pelican heart this gap-toothed heart flinging open its gaudy maw to the sky oh clumsy oh bumblefucked oh giddy oh dumbstruck oh rickshaw oh goat twisting its head at me from my peach tree ’ s highest branch balanced impossibly gobbling the last fruit its tongue working like an engine a lone sweet drop tumbling by some miracle into my mouth like the smell of someone i ’ ve loved heart like an elephant screaming at the bones of its dead heart like the lady on the bus dressed head to toe in gold the sun shivering her shiny boots singing erykah badu to herself leaning her head against the window and thank you the way my father one time came back in a dream by plucking the two cables beneath my chin like a bass fiddle ’ s strings and played me until i woke singing no kidding singing smiling thank you thank you stumbling into the garden where the juneberry ’ s flowers had burst open like the bells of french horns the lily my mother and i planted oozed into the air the bazillion ants labored in their earthen workshops below the collard greens waved in the wind like the sails of ships and the wasps swam in the mint bloom ’ s viscous swill and you again you for hanging tight dear friend i know i can be long-winded sometimes i want so badly to rub the sponge of gratitude over every last thing including you which yes awkward the suds in your ear and armpit the little sparkling gems slipping into your eye soon it will be over which is precisely what the child in my dream said holding my hand pointing at the roiling sea and the sky hurtling our way like so many buffalo who said it ’ s much worse than we think and sooner to whom i said no duh child in my dreams what do you think this singing and shuddering is what this screaming and reaching and dancing and crying is other than loving what every second goes away goodbye i mean to say and thank you every day

a lot of it lives in the trachea you know but not so much that you won ’ t need more muscle the diaphragm a fist clenching at the bottom inhale so many of us are breathless you know like me kneeling to collect the pottery shards of a house plant my elbow has nudged into oblivion what if i sigh and the black earth beneath me scatters like insects running from my breath am i a god then am i insane because i worry about the disassembling of earth regularly i walk more softly now into gardens or up the steps of old houses with impatiens stuffed in their window boxes when it ’ s you standing there with a letter or voice or face full of solemn news will you hold your breath before you knock

yesterday i lost a country i was in a hurry and did n't notice when it fell from me like a broken branch from a forgetful tree please if anyone passes by and stumbles across it perhaps in a suitcase open to the sky or engraved on a rock like a gaping wound or wrapped in the blankets of emigrants or canceled like a losing lottery ticket or helplessly forgotten in purgatory or rushing forward without a goal like the questions of children or rising with the smoke of war or rolling in a helmet on the sand or stolen in ali baba 's jar or disguised in the uniform of a policeman who stirred up the prisoners and fled or squatting in the mind of a woman who tries to smile or scattered like the dreams of new immigrants in america if anyone stumbles across it return it to me please please return it sir please return it madam it is my country i was in a hurry when i lost it yesterday

saturday i ran to mytilene bushes and grass along the glass-still way were all dabbled with rain and the road reeled with shattered skies towards noon an inky petulant wind ravelled the pools and rinsed the black grass round them gulls were up in the late afternoon and the air gleamed and billowed and broadcast flung astringent spray all swordy-silver i saw the hills lie brown and vast and passive the men of mytilene waited restive until the yellow melt of sun i shouted out my news as i sped towards them that all rejoicing could go down to dark all nests with all moist downy young blinking and gulping daylight and all lambs four-braced in straw shivering and mild and the first blood-root up from the ravaged beaches of the old equinox and frangible robins blue teethed right around to sun these first we loudly hymned and then the hour of genesis when the first moody firmament swam out of arctic chaos orbed solidly as the huge frame for this cramped little swaddled creature 's coming forth to slowly foolishly marvellously discover a unique estate held wrapt away from all men else which to embrace our world would have to stretch and swell with strangeness this made us smile and laugh at last there was rejoicing all night long in mytilene
winter advances leaving its white tracks bounding over the hills i climb each december to get to the river where velvety shrews voles and squirrels crisscross in the snow their claw marks reminding me of the exquisitely complicated pattern i watched an ojibwe bite into a birchbark art as old as the world the woman said to me • in the origin myth of eskimos the first children sprouted from fertile soil and like tender plants stayed rooted there being nourished by the earth no one knows how one boy and one girl grew into adults able to walk into the world able to meet and marry • each tree was a letter once pagans spelled out their secrets by threading the proper leaves in proper order— birch tree heather leaf leaf of the ash a language you could hold in your hand words that quivered turned color in the fall that could be taken back burned in regret lonely winters when there was nothing to say • from a north window the choked river a slippery crack of light does my neighbor notice me crouched down my bare fingers exploring the deer tracks i 've found some chips in the ice i wave once but she stares absentmindedly into the cold pure imitation the great bored glacier of her face • how many have known the endless emptiness inside an ordered room how many a silence so profound inside and out • i turn startled as if someone dogged my steps nothing midday sun scatters down among sapling ash at my feet birdtracks wherever i look the only ciphers of the day my footprints merge with the ones laid down here my whole body heart lung muscle leaving its trace • everything that moves leaves a story no story can exist by itself • what am i to the wolf and the rabbit and the fox to the songless birds balancing on branches to the solitary pines dipped in frost • first the trough where it plowed forward then the wide belly-slide down the bank the musty scent-post the scat the smooth hole where the otter slipped through a window in the ice scattered all around a wolverine 's fresh tracks the slashes where its claws raked as it slid to a stop stiff gusts of wind kick up around me twigs and bits of debris soon mar the tracks before long the sharp edges will begin to slump by early next week everything will be erased the immaculate snow unable to keep the shape of a single creature
in the middle of this century we turned to each other with half faces and full eyes like an ancient egyptian picture and for a short while i stroked your hair in the opposite direction to your journey we called to each other like calling out the names of towns where nobody stops along the route lovely is the world rising early to evil lovely is the world falling asleep to sin and pity in the mingling of ourselves you and i lovely is the world the earth drinks men and their loves like wine to forget it ca n't and like the contours of the judean hills we shall never find peace in the middle of this century we turned to each other i saw your body throwing shade waiting for me the leather straps for a long journey already tightening across my chest i spoke in praise of your mortal hips you spoke in praise of my passing face i stroked your hair in the direction of your journey i touched your flesh prophet of your end i touched your hand which has never slept i touched your mouth which may yet sing dust from the desert covered the table at which we did not eat but with my finger i wrote on it the letters of your name
the mind ’ s black kettle hisses its wild exigencies at every turn the hour before the coffee and the hour after penscratch of the gone morning woman a pitched hysteria watching the mad-ant scramble her small wants devouring her binge and skin-thrall her old selves being shuffled off into labyrinths this birdless sky a longing her moth-mouth rabble unfacing touch-and-go months under winter torn letters under floorboards each fickle moon pecked through with doubt and one spoiled onion pale cyclops on her kitchen counter now sprouting green missives some act of contrition neighbor-god ’ s vacuum a loud rule thrown down her mother now on the line saying too much this island is not a martyr you tinker too much with each gaunt memory your youth and its unweeding not everything blooms here a private history — consider this immutable consider our galloping sun its life your starved homesickness the paper wasp kingdom you set fire to watched for days until it burnt a city in you until a family your hands could not save became the hurricane how love is still unrooting you and how to grow a new body — to let each word be the wild rain swallowed pure like an antidote her mother at the airport saying don ’ t come back love your landlocked city money buy a coat and even exile can be glamorous some nights she calls across the deaf ocean to no one in particular no answer her heart ’ s double-vault a muted hydra this hour a purge of its own unselfing she must make a home of it

eight-year-old sitting in bramhall ’ s field shoes scuffed from kicking a stone too young for a key but old enough now to walk the short mile back from school you ’ ve spied your mother down in the village crossing the street purse in her fist in her other hand her shopping bag nurses four ugly potatoes caked in mud a boiling of peas rags of meat or a tail of fish in grease-proof paper the price totted up in penciled columns of shillings and pence how warm must she be in that winter coat on old mount road the nearer she gets the smaller she shrinks until you reach out to carry her home on the flat of your hand or your fingertip and she doesn ’ t exist

mugoo was a sweeper boy and the cleanest of the sweeper caste he would leap at the blush of dawn to clean the paths and the steps spotless gugoo was a bootmaker girl who made boots gugoo was higher caste than mugoo by rights he was the floor and she was the foot that trod yet after work while the boys and girls played at tug of war wrestling or archery shy boy mugoo and shy girl gugoo would draw the boys and girls the children smiling at the shining visions would hug mugoo and gugoo then that couple would bury the drawings for fear their elders feel scandalized in manhood for mugoo and womanhood for gugoo how hard that gugoo thread boots for her father when she had no golden stitch for the gaping hole in her soul how hard that mugoo scrub the lanes who dare be swept away from the law of caste by the foul stamp and passport of besotted love yet the hairs at their ears their nipples bomped by a mere sultana breeze then the swirling night when they ’ d escape for arabia than stay near-far ... in mugoo and gugoo love was a rabbit leaping on a radish when they became runaway lovers like hares under the sketched moon they bobbed in the grunch wind before the tossed river timorous gugoo to timorous mugoo “ is it not said the pure of heart are able to turn water into solid crystal orbs ” “ i have heard it gugoo let us swim till the waters turn dot by dot into crystal orbs slowly mounting up for us a solid path so we can bobble across. ” that cub-like couple held on a first-ever daredevil cuddle then snuck a parched kiss and fell into their dive across punjab ’ s muggur of an ogre — the river ravi they were soon to learn the blunderous water was bigger than they they were dabbing onwards on the spot directionless comical pups pawdawdling ... only death was woken by their swallowed screams at the sight of a cutesome pair brinked for his maw death ’ s thin lips aah ’ d and coo ’ d to tickle himself death tipped a witching shriek in the eardrums of the ferryman charan who was rank in a dream charan swore at death “ what bastard panchod is unheroing my dream i was the river god riding the turmeric sea when the fisher king ’ s red bill fished me up a buxom masala mermaid ” death hushed charan bundled him into the boat charan still swearing fished for a scream-trail for bunny-like feet in the sudden dead-stop river ... next morning by the prophecy of the snake-priest the villagers arrived at the shame-faced riverbank charan in his guzzy saffron turban was blaring at the crowd about a passion crime huffing too had arrived the muscly cobbler and sweeper fathers all heard charan “ i am my own king of the sticks i row two weeks that way to the flowers of kashmir the gold-haired men with their bloated bags of honey and one week that way for the spices of samarkand with the red-fingered sellers of kalonji saffron jeera today i catch by the feet a fresh parable of a kutcha- pucka business i sing it for only one rupee each ” all looked down by charan ’ s sandal ’ d feet dared to be rolled in the same shivering blanket like a chapati rolled around saag paneer yet fearing to be parted yet tenuously panting were mugoo and gugoo the frail couple like shy red squirrels “ o father we love you but most we are ... loving this this that is my soul ’ s mirror mugoo is my gugoo gugoo is my mugoo. ” the bony youths clung sauced together stiffed for the glooping apart the bootmaker father been crunching his own fists the sweeper father been hurling daggers from his eyes as the crowd fell silent the fathers spoke as one “ what draws them out of caste their underhand idle drawings such fancy is inking good for nothing. ” gugoo and mugoo raised their necks “ if all hearts were good for nothing could love from each for each blow as one ” the apricot breeze blew a soft cadence but could it push the dominion of the communal mind past its bound and daily utility could sweet nothings clear the world free of blood fear of sweet-faced mugoo and gugoo in a threadbare pleading “ do not part us. ” from their mild rhetoric and politic of love the hills and valleys had swooned into blossoms of heaven and had set the scene with gaudiest cheeks so who dare part them o love be roused take arms and wound for the cause of love or at least shackle the shadows that deepened into that tinsy couple

1 the white butterfly in the park is being read by many i love that cabbage-moth as if it were a fluttering corner of truth itself at dawn the running crowds set our quiet planet in motion then the park fills with people to each one eight faces polished like jade for all situations to avoid making mistakes to each one there 's also the invisible face reflecting `` something you do n't talk about '' something that appears in tired moments and is as rank as a gulp of viper schnapps with its long scaly aftertaste the carp in the pond move continuously swimming while they sleep setting an example for the faithful always in motion 2 it 's midday laundry flutters in the gray sea-wind high over the cyclists who arrive in dense schools notice the labrinths on each side i 'm surrounded by written characters that i ca n't interpret i 'm illiterate through and through but i 've paid what i owe and have receipts for everything i 've accumulated so many illegible receipts i 'm an old tree with withered leaves that hang on and ca n't fall to the ground and a gust from the sea gets all these receipts rustling 3 at dawn the trampling hordes set our quiet planet in motion we 're all aboard the street and it 's as crammed as the deck of a ferry where are we headed are there enough teacups we should consider ourselves lucky to have made it aboard this street it 's a thousand years before the birth of claustrophobia hovering behind each of us who walks here is a cross that wants to catch up with us pass us unite with us something that wants to sneak up on us from behind put its hands over our eyes and whisper `` guess who '' we look almost happy out in the sun while we bleed to death from wounds we don't know about
it 's all foreplay really-this walk through the french quarter exploring souvenir shops each of them carefully deranged as if dust were to settle only at perfect intervals yes to the vetiver fan that smells sweeter than sandalwood or cedar no to the mammy doll dinner bells no to the mammy dolls whose sewn smiles are as fixed as the lives of too many poor black women here motherhood at twelve drugged abandoned by fifteen dead by twenty suicide murder so easily in desire and yet their voices sweeten the snaking air providing the transvestites their proper muses all of whom have streets named for them in the garden district a soft heat settles on terpsichore just inside the gay bar where the owner 's pink flamingos complement silly songs on the rescued rockola who can dance to that lorne greene ballad `` ringo '' dixie beer is the beer of choice marijuana the cheapest drug relaxation is key since it 's all a matter of waiting for the right body to stumble toward you lust perfumes parties in the projects barstool chatter at the hyatt lazy kissing on the median strip stretching down tchoupitoulas if professor longhair were alive he 'd teach a lesson in seamless motion the perfect slide of a man 's hand down a woman 's back a lesson you learned long ago before you met me we are making love as we did before in austin and manhattan but in this room on this costly bed our lovemaking starts out the slowest grind then like this city 's weather goes from hot to hotter from moist to rainstorm wet you 're tall a. and where there should be tribal markings there are scars-football basketball mid-sixties grind parties where something always got out of hand there 's the perfect amen you 're your own gospel and you bring good news to me-the way you enter me like grace the way you say my name a psalm no that 's not it it 's the engineer in you that gets me your search for the secret line that goes straight to the center of the earth deeper and deeper you go until there 's no earth left in me and we hum and moan a song as old as our selves gone back there are too many souvenirs in your eyes gifts given too often too hastily never opened outside a city sprawls its heat seeks out every pore licks every moment of sweat as we shiver in this chilly room taking each other 's measure we say good-bye again and again as if every kiss every touch we make will shadow all our celebrations and they do
fat face the color of blanc on blanc smelling of cheap tobacco and many unwashed garments from the other end of the car the unmistakable melody of la vi en rose scratched against tender ears of parisian commuters `` not la vi en rose again '' said the young frenchman facing me i understood every word he said the old woman singing was no tiny sparrow no waif her corpulent canine companion was equally uncouth she sang piaf 's signature song with a hostile gusto each syllable enunciated loudly we sniggered as the singing voice came closer so close we began to sing along conspirators smiling and we welcomed the doleful silence at the song 's inevitable end i gave her a centime or was it two she deserved it was she blind did it matter as for me i am weary of speaking shattered spanish with argentinean intellectuals and outmoded american slang with the moroccan grocer and his cousins on the boulevard saint-michel near rue du val-de-grâce and i can not seem to count past the number sept gloved hands push apart the metro 's doors it is journey 's end i try singing piaf 's mysterious refrain grateful for my own soulful silly version on the walk towards the rue henri-barbusse a short slice of street named for a revolutionary or was he a pirate philosopher tired and cheered outside my american language i am puzzled with the battered glamour of this city built for electric illuminations swift flirtations as i follow the paths to dead poets shaped in solemn statuary harboring the austere lawns of the jardin du luxembourg
if i eat a diet of rain and nuts walk to the p.o in a loincloth file for divorce from the world of matter say not-it to the sea oats not-it to the sky above the disheveled palms not-it to the white or green oyster boats and the men on the bridge with their fishing rods that resemble so many giant whiskers if i repeat this is not it this is not why i 'm waiting here will i fill the universe with all that is not-it and allow myself to grow very still in the center of this fishing town in winter will i look out past the cat sleeping in the windowsill and say not-it garbage can not-it long 's video store until i happen upon what is not not-it will i wake up and behold the `` actual '' the `` real '' the `` awe-thentic '' the is instead i walk down the island quicky take a pound of bait shrimp in an ice-filled baggie then walk to the beach to catch my dinner now waiting is the work i 'm waiting for now the sand crane dive-bombs the surf of his own enlightenment because everything is bait and lust and hard-up for supper i came out here to pare things down wanted to be wind simple as sand to hear each note in the infinite orchestra of waves fizzling out beneath the rotting dock at five o'clock in the afternoon when the voice that i call i is a one-man boat slapping toward the shore of a waning illusion hello waves of salty and epiphanic distance good day bird who will eventually go blind from slamming headfirst into the water what do you say fat flounder out there deep in your need looking like sand speckled with shells lying so still you 're hardly there lungs lifting with such small air flesh both succulent and flakey when baked with white wine lemon and salt your eyes rolling toward their one want when the line jerks and the reel clicks and the rod bends and you give up the ocean floor for a mouthful of land

we could hear her knocking down strands of cobweb from ceilings—sticky filaments sacs of eggs—as we woke most mornings to a worm of discontent it lodged beneath the heart rubbed our frayed nerves gnawed at the gut spleen ovaries filth was mom 's first enemy so each day began with ritual cleaning the stab and sweep of the broom down the dark hall over the stained and scratched oak floors for weeks she held her dust mop one-handed and with the other cupped a hernia while she swore at us kids in that hard voice—a litany of our sins and failures sloth stupidity secrecy we watched her smash the spiders that ran herky-jerky along the baseboards while we ran too glaring at each other we gathered up the scattered laundry our father ’ s shoes his newspapers and tools our books drawings music sweatshirts and jackets whatever we ’ d left lying around we were guilty but good at evasion we cultivated shrewish or obsessive behaviors of our own my tough older sister sneered and stalked out of the house to meet her boyfriend my sweet younger sister trembled and cried comforted by one of our many dogs i slammed doors pounded them with my fists screamed “ shut up shut up shut up ” she couldn ’ t leave us alone she loved us too much though we were quick she was quicker her words stung we must have deserved it
happy birthday kenneth koch/feb 27 we went to all those places where they restore sadness and joy and call it art we were piloted by auden who became unbearably acrimonious when we dropped off senghor into the steamy skies of his beloved west africa the termites and ants were waiting for him to unearth the sun in elissa the clouds were as cool as a dog ’ s nose pressed against our cheeks i notice your eggshell skin is as creamy as a lion ’ s armpit as we cross the horizon on strands of yeats ’ silver hair there is a light coffee flame in his eyes guiding us like an old irish house cleaner holding a candle in a black and white english movie yeats ’ lips look like an angry rimbaud illuminating poetry with his youth and vigorous sunlight he knew eternity would vanish the sun at dusk he caught it with a rainbow tied to his finger there was nothing left after that we cross the equator heading north following emily dickinson ’ s black bag containing stems of her longer poems preserved in darkness and memory like wild pearls thrown overboard to avoid capture by spanish pirates the islands below float by like water hearts in a child ’ s aquarium we are candy wrappers being blown across the waxed floors of poetry we land on the brooklyn bridge whitman ’ s past-port face is grinning at the nineteenth century in the thorny arms of gerard manley hopkins whose head was set on fire by god ’ s little hands the hands that circumcised the world gertrude stein is a match flaring on a young woman ’ s pillow whose birthmarks have been stolen we cross the green atlantic into world war one we are met by rilke dressed in his orpheus uniform wearing white sonnet gloves that once belonged to a stone angel rilke offers us a glass of amontillado made from lorca ’ s private stock of gypsy tears the sherry is not quite as dry as wallace stevens ’ lush mango metaphors of familiar objects although stevens ’ poems are fragrant there is a lingering afterthought of pound on the tongue pound collected his misty feelings to make raindrops into european and american poetry vagueness became as sharp as a pencil our blue box is not allowed to attend apollinaire ’ s birthday party held by the august académie française on the eiffel tower he is being awarded the “ golden frog souffle award ” and a one-way ticket to the greek and roman past to spend afternoons with williams filling wheel- barrows with the twentieth century both apollinaire and williams could hail a cab on madison avenue in any country after the bash we toured paris and london with d.h. lawrence who kept stopping to relieve himself of the great mysteries of life whenever we went by a bavarian gentian plant he claimed he was writing poetry for his new book acts of attention for love poems eliot was rebuilding london when we left it reminded him of detroit or cincinnati or saint louis he was removing despair from the weather he thought it affected people ’ s minds and did not want to overload mayakovsky ’ s emptiness with old english churches that pray for water heaters and cloudless nights mayakovsky on the other hand insisted there were bugs in russia who could write poetry just as interestingly as eliot the russian winter is elegant cruelty compared with the english milk-toast weather “ a man without a cloud in his trousers is not a man. ” eliot thought this was the most boring statement he had ever heard although cummings ’ poems appear unintentional on the surface he did not act like a drunken amputee at the dinner table and always said pleasant things that came out of nowhere his conversation was experimental but logical and he investigated words mixing them on paper with a pencil cummings was all etcetera after a few drinks we move the sun to south america neruda had become an organic poet writing about the fulcra of yes and no he wasn ’ t home when we got there so we went over to allen ’ s for some microbiotic poetry as usual allen was rolling incense and howling at america allen was always mystical and beautiful when he walked on the lower east side when he stepped into the old jewish pavement he mystified the habitués david shapiro the djinn of subatomic poetry asked allen what was the future of poetry in the borough of queens allen placed the palm of his right hand on david ’ s glistening forehead and said “ david don ’ t you know the future has no future it is very old and doesn ’ t worry about its future anymore because it has so little left of it. ” allen made suicide exhilarating when he wrote kaddish finally suicide could talk about the pain of living with unbearable beauty beauty was frank o ’ hara talking to second avenue with a diamond in his head we were the personal details in frank ’ s harem of private lives when leroi insisted on becoming black abandoning us for a noble cause according to frank who loved imamu amiri baraka we were the details in frank ’ s poems and living one ’ s life was a detail in frank ’ s life john ashbery arrived from paris on a plane made of expensive suits shirts and ties like his poems he was sparkling and squeaky clean dressed in elegant language he is the daydream that had become a poet his subject is to have no subject perhaps a casual reference to someone special he is a poet of the less obvious in life the sestina made of clouds we crossed the equator on our way to a cocktail party for gary snyder there is no other life for his outdoor poems hitchhiking on hands-on love gary seems to have time to write poems about the notes in his life kenneth on the other hand has a paper

one way to erase an island is to invent a second island absolved of all the sounds the first one ever made we don ’ t know who concocted this one where the triggerfish and clowns fade to inky neon dashes under a fisherman ’ s skiff a few plastic pontoons knock around makeshift slips dusk coaxes from the shore the small dull chime of a spoon against a pot and tv voices flash slow across a cliff where two pink lovers in matching swimwear kiss their glasses at the edge of a blue pool built just low enough into the hill so the couple can gaze into the sea and think of infinity many many years ago a great emperor wiggled his finger and commanded his army to corral all the lepers in his domain then pack them into a sailing ship to be delivered to the missions on this cluster of verdant volcanic rock the emperor ’ s orders to his captain were clear if the monks refused the ship ’ s freight the skipper was to simply dump the whole sick cargo far from any shore other incurables followed in lots over time or trickled in hiding from nearby tribes or banished from other lands to live among these lush slopes of mahogany papaya and weeds two women filomena and josefa arrived within days of one another by then each had lost most their toes though they had ten full fingers between them each woman with one hand still intact no one is sure how it began but once a week the pair would knock on the door of the scowling madre clementina to borrow the hospital ’ s only guitar carved from jackfruit and cracked pretty bad along the back to these women — no big deal for filomena once transcribed the early moonlight serenades of the horny friars in the royal south for the brats of an andalusian duke josefa was the daughter of a carpenter a maker of tables to be exact she learned to play a harana ’ s tremulous melodies on her mother ’ s bandurria at the age of three the pair of outcasts would stifle laughs thrilled to earn the crusty nun ’ s grudging yes then amble out to low tide and find a flat rock to share so they could prop the old guitar on both their laps the one bad wrist of each woman unwrapped to their stumps pulled for now behind their backs as they looked past the bay toward the violent waters that first carried them here and they jammed filomena with the five deft hammers of her left and josefa with her right thick-muscled — both blue-veined and furious scrubbing from the instrument all those wicked rhythms from castile to nowhere on a fragile scrap of furniture that could barely hold its tune they sat shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh their good hands brushing from time to time what they couldn ’ t remember they made up and everything they made up disappeared over the lagoon and over the ocean every note in every run every lie and desire every nick and crack in the jackfruit the fat harmonics plucked from the old nun ’ s grunts six taut strands of gut whose chords skimmed the water like night locusts in bursts of low clouds and which bore everything in front of them and behind the brine of the women ’ s necks mixed with the salt of the lagoon the cliffs the spoons the bright nimbus of the west dipping like a noose the future of pontoons and fake tits the history of nifty crowns pried loose of their jewels the jiggle of a little finger gone still one way to erase an island is to invent the waters that surround it you can name the waters that will turn all the sounds the island makes into salt it will teach you to listen to everything you love disappear ... or you can invent a song so big it will hold the entire ocean josefa and filomena rocked in the dark hip to hip joined by that third body of wood which made sure there was nothing left in the unbroken world to possibly make them whole
these empty words are so remote they are stories someone wants to believe at the end of the century everyone gathers their sea of telluric pain to greet the beginning of the new world cars stop and watch the deck chairs limp across the street to await the coming of the new year it is the end of summer and autumn and winters and springs and panzer infatuation after four hundred eighty-one years i can not pull out the spanish arrow in my eye suddenly everything i knew was inhuman the oceans the tadpoles in their new cars the clams became cheerleaders the palm trees strippers and everyone forgot deer are the shapes of god his official language became latin when he ceased to be a jew biting his nails and collecting cans like a cheap minister with sunny gold teeth the tender years that once wore oysters would never speak to him again the female spider became a lesbian devouring our new long legs that would never again climb the toy steps our fathers left us although our legs are hairy and the lilies of a theater the gentle lips of our pyramids rest on our souls like a lover ’ s fingers how many aspirins will we take to reach the surface of truth my existence is for sale the dawn is learning english the waves of the sea are unionizing the stones that were once our troubled hearts are eating chocolate i come to sell you fish the bread in my blood and my existence

i will tell you what he told me in the years just after the war as we then called the second world war do n't lose your arrogance yet he said you can do that when you 're older lose it too soon and you may merely replace it with vanity just one time he suggested changing the usual order of the same words in a line of verse why point out a thing twice he suggested i pray to the muse get down on my knees and pray right there in the corner and he said he meant it literally it was in the days before the beard and the drink but he was deep in tides of his own through which he sailed chin sideways and head tilted like a tacking sloop he was far older than the dates allowed for much older than i was he was in his thirties he snapped down his nose with an accent i think he had affected in england as for publishing he advised me to paper my wall with rejection slips his lips and the bones of his long fingers trembled with the vehemence of his views about poetry he said the great presence that permitted everything and transmuted it in poetry was passion passion was genius and he praised movement and invention i had hardly begun to read i asked how can you ever be sure that what you write is really any good at all and he said you can't you ca n't you can never be sure you die without knowing whether anything you wrote was any good if you have to be sure do n't write

the brent geese fly in long low wavering lines on their migrations they start in western europe fatten in iceland then fly over the greenland ice cap to canada they sometimes breed on the arctic coasts of central and western siberia and winter in western europe some in england the rest in germany and france what i have to offer here is nothing revolutionary they learn the map from their parents or through culture rather than through genetics it is just an observation a small observation that sometimes art can hold the oil wars and all that they mean and might yet mean within just as sometimes there are seven stanzas in a song and just as sometimes there is a refrain between each stanza and just as often this sort of song tells a certain sort of story one about having something and then losing it just as sometimes the refrain of a song is just one word said four times just as sometimes the word is huge sometimes coming from a machine and yet hitting in the heart uplifting and ironic and big enough to hold all these things in its four syllables just as some- times often even it contradicts and thus works with the stanzas just as the police clear out yet another public space and yet another camera follows along behind just as the stream has no narration only ambient noise and the police move slowly methodically in a line as if they are a many-legged machine they know what they are doing it is their third time clearing the park and they will clear it many more times and then they will win and a building will be built where there once was the park in this song as is true of many songs it is unclear why the singer has lost something maybe someone in this time the time of the oil wars there are many reasons that singers give for being so lost often they are lost because of love sometimes they are lost because of drugs sometimes they have lost their country and in their heart it feels as if they have lost something big and then sometimes they are lost just because they are in bakersfield really though they are lost because in this time song holds loss and this time is a time of loss the police know as they move through the park yet one more time that they will win and a building will be built on the space but right now the building is not there all that is there are the police and debris and the police deal with the debris they push over book- shelves open up boxes and look inside tear into tents awkwardly the poles springing they are only there to see if any humans remain tomorrow the bulldozers will push the debris into big piles and load it into trucks the police wear white helmets and short sleeves under their kevlar vests for many years the brent geese ate eelgrass but once the eelgrass was gone to the wasting disease and the estuaries filled they moved inland to agricultural lands and began eating grasses and winter-sown cereals the brent geese are social adaptable they fly around together learning from each other even as these groups are often unstable changing from season to season songs in their most popular versions tend to be epiphanic gorgeous with swelling chord changes full of lament too and this song like many expresses the desire to be near someone who is now lost it travels as something layered infiltrated unconfused with its refusals to make a simple sense i want to give you this song sung in a bar in oakland one night during the ongoing oil wars the singer had clearly been lost once but they sang as someone who eventually got in the car and drove out of bakersfield perhaps early in the morning the sun just starting to rise or perhaps later after sun-up the light washing out everything in bakersfield as the sun is wont to do there eventually they arrived to sing this song this might have taken them many years there was nothing that implied that the lostness was recent but the lostness it was clear was huge and had been experienced fully by them it probably does n't matter where the sun was that day in bakersfield when they got in the car it probably just matters that there is a sun still and they got in the car and drove drove through the oil fields with their wells pumping out amber colored oils and their refineries with tall towers that heat the oil so as to sort its various viscosities and drove through the black cloud that is the slow constant burn of the oil wars then at some point they were in oakland the oil near bakersfield is heavy but it often benchmarks against the brent blend brent blend is a light crude oil though not as light as west texas intermediate it contains approximately 0.37 of sulphur classifying it as sweet crude yet not as sweet as west texas intermediate when the park is cleared and the building is built it will headquarter an oil company when this oil company named their oil fields off the coast of scotland they choose the names of water birds in alphabetical order auk brent cormorant dunlin eider fulmar and so on brent is also an acronym for the jurassic brent formation that makes up the brent oilfield for broom rannoch etive ness and tarbert about two thirds of oil is benchmarked against what is called the brent crude oil spot price petroleum suppliers in europe africa and the middle east often price their oil according to brent crude 's value on the interconti- nential exchange if it is being sold to the west the brent crude oil spot price is set in dollars maintained by force endlessly manipulated by commodity futures markets the refrain is the moment when the singer makes it clear that they understand something about what is being lost it was obvious they had lost their country it being taken over by bankers and all they had clearly been rejected loved too much and gotten too little of it back in return many times but none of this matters it was obvious in comparison to what is now being lost for that night even though the song is about a minor loss about the loss of tongue on clit or cock the singer seemed to understand s0mething about the other things that are lost while a formation of police clear the far side of the park of the debris of its occupation another forma- tion of police on the other side shoot the new gasses the ones we do not yet know by name into another part of the park where people are now clustered this camera has sound and every few seconds there is a pop it is unevenly steady the song is just about two people who are not near each other who have probably chosen not to be near each other any more the song reflects and refracts the oil in ways both relevant and trivial in how it tells about what happens when one lets love go when one gives up the tongue it might be that only through the minor we can feel enormity it might be that there is nothing to epiphany if it does not hint at the moment of sweaty relation larger than the intimate for what is epiphanic song if it does n't spill out and over the many that are pulled from intimacies by oil 's circulations the truckers the sailors and deckhands the assembly line workers those who maintain the pipelines those who drive support in the caravans that escort the tankers the fertilizers the thousands of interlocking plastic parts the workers who move two hundred miles and live in a dorm near a factory alone those on the ships who spend fifty weeks circulating with the oil unable to talk to each other because of no shared language and so are left only with two weeks in each year where they can experience the tongue in meaningful conversation a life that is only circulations before the police come before the building in the middle of one night a group of people form a line leading to the entrance of the park or several groups form several lines all leading to the entrance some wear medical masks some wear glasses too all pass bricks one by one down the line so as to make a pile they are silent for the most part silent enough that it is possible to hear the bricks make a clink as they fall the pile gets bigger and bigger it is waist high then chest high some get out of the line and climb on the pile hold both their hands in the air because they know now is the transitory momentary triumph and it should be felt others continue passing brick after brick from one hand to another hand arms extended torsos at moments also going back and forth with the bricks when they run out of bricks the pile is topped with fencing then they gather behind it waiting back there some- one might possibly be singing to a child singing the epiphanic song that alludes to losing the moment of tongue on clit or cock over and over because the child can not be comforted because the singer knows only loss the room will be dark the light will be on in the hall there will be shadows in other words and the singer will know about these shadows at this moment and know they had agreed to be with shadows when they had the child they had gambled in a sense on a question of sustaining they had agreed to exist from now on with a shadow a shadow of love and a shadow of the burning of the oil fields that has already happened and is yet to come and yet must come and a million other shadows that might possibly disappear in the light at that moment

the host 's girlfriend is barely seen she 's busy giving away wild animals to reluctant guests i agree to take a snake-dog maybe an electric eel but when i feel its sharp teeth in my shoulder i start to worry about the future welfare of our fragile cat the precarious order of our rented home and remember i am supposed to be looking for someone ... a half-wolf half-elephant cracks through the walls of the peeling wallpapered bedroom where my former student in a fuschia robe and curlers sits by a lighted make-up mirror the shadows off elongated fake eyelashes are as dark as the branches of an evening tree the hovering body of a fiery sparrow is almost transparent like flute music or an idea i turn my back and finally i spot her my friend the host she 's sipping rum punch from a martini glass her whole body appears to be smiling glowing and i do n't know what to think i know she does n't drink has n't in decades and i wonder what 's suddenly changed but then i remember the cancer won my friend is n't actually here there is no party there was never a house
i hope the only reason that i am this pre-autumn afternoon in the privacy of my suspicious living room grant myself permission to believe in god once again is solely because i saw an unexpected grasshopper staring at my thoughts on the table that keeps the telephone from having a mind of its very own at first i was startled and then i was startled less at the sight of this insect put together in green details to pay me an afternoon visit 39 floors above floor level in my high rise hobo apartment miracle on 53rd street grasshopper hopped all the way 39 floors above floor level to deliberately invade my privacy and i did n't mind at all after grasshopper assured me it did n't speak english or spanish or chinese with an italian accent so we hit it off right away you mind your own business and i will not ask you any personal questions aside from how the hell did you get here i 've never written a poem about grasshoppers this high up before and i know it was n't something my non existing paint brushes conceived behind my back and the only grass i have here is to smoke not hop around in until i get dizzy and levitate there has to be a mistake or did the grasshopper take the elevator to the 39th floor and enter my apartment without knocking to make it obvious grasshoppers have the right to remain silent also and give credit to the desert for his arrival and not no almighty the only other mystery capable

somewhere between here and belen the rio grande will narrow to a muddy bead no more than three feet across from shore to shore my friend nick markulis claims he loves the river 's color there and will bathe his toes in the water and will go on and on about a dry river in athens that measures its life in olive groves stratis thalassinos told me about these peculiar waters that disappear and turn up again and of course you know of arethusa's fountain in syracuse i do not accuse markopoulos do i have the name right —markopoulos markulis fugitive names fugitive lives docking in halifax of being too conversant with asphodel meadows but one can not remain composed when hunters and cultic figures press their claims upon a sainted afternoon think now of the intimate authority of la candelaria the sunday morning concert the walk through the abandoned streets where all was an occasion of bogotá a memory of mazatlán a shaping necessity we might have met at salamis who can be sure that this white cloth will be dissolved by death

i stand there under the high limbs of locust watching my father point a black gun into the air his arms steepled for the stillness required to split the proverbial hair with a bb i would like to throw a red hat to catch what will smack from the barrel but instead the songbird drops fast—a warm stone through liquid swimming between us the stink of yellow sulfur thick and the twist of his mouth like tangled purple boughs or crossed legs of what he never dreamed he 'd hit years after i will admit only to so much blue moon tomorrow do we ever get a second chance it 's what i do n't say that speaks loudest
o benjamin p. lovell 19 from oneonta new york state who appears in the police blotter in thursday ’ s daily star for unlawful possession of marijuana the police blotter hangs just below the cast of hairpsray rehearsing at the suny oneonta goodrich theater where the girl playing tracy turnblad looks as if she ’ s been helping herself to donuts maybe the donuts we were eating at barlow ’ s general store treadwell do you ever get an upstate rush i ’ ve never been crazy about donuts but these are the aristocrats of the donut world and i salute them and i hope benjamin your mom isn ’ t going to be too mad as she casts her eye down the police blotter and sees your name there you little shit and i hope the authorities remember being young when the whole world sometimes seemed somehow like a gargantuan donut that either pulled you to its bosom o tracy or kicked down — somewhere — to the bloodstream sweet donut do i love thee i haven ’ t mentioned brando k. goodluck 18 from manhattan charged with seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance o brando o brando what were you thinking as i put a donut in my mouth i ’ m thinking i wouldn ’ t mind a joint and in any case maybe all these donuts are pretty dangerous and i wonder what would happen if the rules got jumbled up and the girl playing tracy turnblad slid down the page and found herself in the police blotter charged with unlawful possession of a donut suddenly america feels different and i like it police blotters throughout the nation packed with donutheads and half the country on the run as college girls make secret calls and meet their dealers in dusty ghost towns sweet vapors drifting through the trees o america where even the robins are bigger where every car that slides into the forecourt of barlow ’ s general store is a dodge where half the population is chasing the perfect donut let ’ s imagine that benjamin p. lovell and brando k. goodluck nice slim boys who never touched a donut in their lives wander into barlow ’ s and roll a joint and talk about those losers who kneel down before “ the big one. ” they know the girl who was playing tracy turnblad she was sweet they say who went and threw it all away for a sleazy bun with a hole in it they pass the joint to me and i can feel the donuts i stuffed in haste somewhere down my slacks i blush real shame i say mrs. barlow says you boys want more coffee the donuts on her shelves have gone
1 claude says he too was given the tracks and not the train the way — and not the way out not the beyond beyond that bend or the next the place they call drybridge — for the waterless bed of rails — where on the banks you grow up learning more news from hoboes than from the mailman but you know nothing of the train as it passes behind the backs of grander houses gutted warehouses chained dogs as it grazes an alien grid of fences — of stone metal and chain-link or that when it passes beneath the underside of a bridge a boy your own age waves the way you do and that there is a horse doesn ’ t lift its head and one that does only to lower it again 2 you are a grown man when the train comes to a scalding stop and a lantern swings down the road a man has been killed they call out from behind the light ’ s aura and would you come see what you can tell of him by what ’ s left you do know his hat and that burn scar on the back of his hand what you know of his wife you do not say and will not even the next night when you sit up with the body in the house he wanted that much shut of her voice rigid as its walls while the train you hear out there in the darkness passes by the way it always does as though the same the very same and again on the time it will this night be able to keep

what stopped her bawling was the doorbell ringing and a man standing there with five yellow roses bulked up with green fronds and tied in a dinky knot with olive twine there was no card to say who the flowers came from the man ’ s uniform was blue with a brown insignia of a spider on his right top pocket that she saw he kept unbuttoned as he waltzed down the path to the gate the siamese cat that frequented the garden raised its back and hissed the man laughed and flounced out to his waiting white van oh the shit-faced side streets of life ok she ’ d been born in madras in a flowery tea shop while an albino conjurer magicked a hare to leap from his heavily-ringed brown fingers five yellow roses enough to encourage her to cook saffron rice with turmeric-tinged prawns and sautéed yellow courgettes she didn ’ t play the ry cooder where yellow roses say goodbye

she perches high on the stand gleaming whistle dangling on her suit a dutiful faded red cross mine her only life to guard she does for a while watch the middle-aged woman who has nothing better to do than swim laps in the y 's indoor pool on a late friday afternoon i am slow though boring length after predictable length of breaststroke or the duller lap of elementary backstroke perfectly executed within the taut confines of the brightly buoyed lane so she abandons me to study split-ends hangnail wristwatch until—the body of the whistle cupped loosely in her palm—her head nods toward shallow dreams i 've never felt so safe in my life making flawless practiced turns pushing invisible to reenter my own wake reverse it
for micah ruelle we were not green in judgment or cold in blood like cleopatra in her youth who still was ordering chopped radish in her bowls back then the hearts all gone to pieces next to the winter greens that in our days we never had use for so smitten were we with fire and ovens that i was gravy in judgment which might not mean much unless you ’ ve taken a spoon of it and poured it back over a dumpling shaped like your heart so that it became even softer something you could not have thought possible it ’ s all happening now you liked to say and i agreed though it was not the news from the outside i relished but the daily extra extra the light of the morning brought to my attention every time we woke in your house or my house and my heart — salty risen — was warm again in a way it hadn ’ t been for years organ of passion organ of righteousness that has never had a single flavor cross its lips how could you know how much i would miss the honey of those days her drizzle of it on the turkey bacon my cracking pepper up and down the pan the sweet meat of happiness i would no longer let pass between our teeth
last night this commercial came on tv it was this white lady making a nice dinner for her husband she made him some baked chicken with potatoes and gravy and some kind of greens—not collards but they still looked real good everything looked so delicious i just wanted to reach into that television and snatch a plate for myself he gave her a kiss and then a voice came on saying he 'll love you for it and then the commercial went off i sat on miss edna 's scratchy couch wondering if that man and woman really ate that food or just threw it all away now ms. marcus wants to know why i wrote that the lady is white and i say because it 's true and ms. marcus says lonnie what does race have to do with it forgetting that she asked us to use lots of details when we wrote forgetting that whole long talk she gave yesterday about the importance of description i do n't say anything back to her just look down at my arm it 's dark brown and there 's a scab by my wrist that i do n't pick at if i remember not to i look at my knuckles they 're real dark too outside it 's starting to rain and the way the rain comes down—tap tapping against the window—gets me to thinking ms. marcus do n't understand some things even though she 's my favorite teacher in the world things like my brown brown arm and the white lady and man with all that good food to throw away how if you turn on your tv that 's what you see—people with lots and lots of stuff not having to sit on scratchy couches in miss edna 's house and the true fact is alotta those people are white maybe it 's that if you 're white you ca n't see all the whiteness around you
the monsters that come at night don't breathe fire have two heads or long claws the monsters that come at night don't come bloody and half-dead and calling your name they come looking like regular boys going through your drawers and pockets saying you better not tell counselor else i 'll beat you down the monsters that come at night snatch the covers off your bed take your pillow and in the morning steal your bacon when the cook 's back is turned call themselves the throwaway boys say you one of us now when the relatives stop coming when you do n't know where your sister is anymore when every sign around you says group home rules don't do this and do n't do that until it sinks in one rainy saturday afternoon while you 're sitting at the group home window reading a beat-up group home book wearing a group home hand-me-down shirt hearing all the group home loudness that you are a throwaway boy and the news just sits in your stomach hard and heavy as group home food
ms. marcus says that an occasional poem is a poem written about something important or special that 's gon na happen or already did think of a specific occasion she says—and write about it like what lamont asks he 's all slouched down in his seat i do n't feel like writing about no occasion how about your birthday ms. marcus says what about it just a birthday comes in june and it ain't june lamont says as a matter of fact he says it 's january and it 's snowing then his voice gets real low and he says and when it 's january and all cold like this feels like june 's a long long ways away the whole class looks at ms. marcus some of the kids are nodding outside the sky looks like it 's made out of metal and the cold cold air is rattling the windowpanes and coming underneath them too i seen lamont 's coat it 's gray and the sleeves are too short it 's down but it looks like a lot of the feathers fell out a long time ago ms. marcus got a nice coat it 's down too but real puffy so maybe when she 's inside it she ca n't even tell january from june then write about january ms. marcus says that's an occasion but she looks a little bit sad when she says it like she 's sorry she ever brought the whole occasional poem thing up i was gon na write about mama 's funeral but lamont and ms. marcus going back and forth zapped all the ideas from my head i guess them arguing on a tuesday in january 's an occasion so i guess this is an occasional poem
when the kids in my class ask why i am not allowed to pledge to the flag i tell them it 's against my religion but do n't say i am in the world but not of the world this they would not understand even though my mother 's not a jehovah 's witness she makes us follow their rules and leave the classroom when the pledge is being said every morning i walk out with gina and alina the two other witnesses in my class sometimes gina says maybe we should pray for the kids inside who do n't know that god said '' no other idols before me '' that our god is a jealous god gina is a true believer her bible open during reading time but alina and i walk through our roles as witnesses as though this is the part we 've been given in a play and once offstage we run free sing '' america the beautiful '' and `` the star-spangled banner '' far away from our families—knowing every word alina and i want more than anything to walk back into our classroom press our hands against our hearts say '' i pledge allegiance '' loud without our jealous god looking down on us without our parents finding out without our mothers voices in our heads saying you are different chosen good when the pledge is over we walk single file back into the classroom take our separate seats alina and i far away from gina but gina always looks back at us—as if to say i 'm watching you as if to say i know
no one was faster than my father on the football field no one could keep him from crossing the line then touching down again coaches were watching the way he moved his easy stride his long arms reaching up snatching the ball from its soft pockets of air my father dreamed football dreams and woke up to a scholarship at ohio state university grown now living the big-city life in columbus just sixty miles from nelsonville and from there interstate 70 could get you on your way west to chicago interstate 77 could take you south but my father said no colored buckeye in his right mind would ever want to go there from columbus my father said you could go just about anywhere
my mother says when mama tried to teach me to make collards and potato salad i did n't want to learn she opens the box of pancake mix adds milk and eggs stirs i watch grateful for the food we have now—syrup waiting in the cabinet bananas to slice on top it 's saturday morning five days a week she leaves us to work at an office back in brownsville saturday we have her to ourselves all day long me and kay did n't want to be inside cooking she stirs the lumps from the batter pours it into the buttered hissing pan wanted to be with our friends running wild through greenville there was a man with a peach tree down the road one day robert climbed over that fence filled a bucket with peaches would n't share them with any of us but told us where the peach three was and that 's where we wanted to be sneaking peaches from that man 's tree throwing the rotten ones at your uncles mama wanted us to learn to cook ask the boys we said and mama knew that was n't fair girls inside and the boys going off to steal peaches so she let all of us stay outside until suppertime and by then she says putting our breakfast on the table it was too late

they ’ d barely emerged from the deep-green forests of that epauletted century geraniums bloomed on windowsills in heidelberg student princes eyed the tavern keeper ’ s daughter through the blond foam of their tankards the future must have seemed weightless as it came nosing through the clouds smooth as a biblical fish throwing its giant shadow on the sea floor its thin gold-beater ’ s skin pressed back against its ribs cloche-hatted women in fox furs waving through its observation windows composed of too much dream stuff to be echt matériel shoals of them congregated silently over london in the moon ’ s dark phases concealed above clouds their crews were unnerved by crackling blue halos eerie lightning shot from frostbitten fingers as they lowered spy baskets on trapeze wires below the cloud cover taking careful soundings then dropped their antique payloads on the gaping population those whom they did not kill scarcely believed in them improbable contraptions the parchment-yellow color of old maps vessels a rational traveler might have chosen a half-century earlier to pursue daft round-the-world steampunk wagers but for them — the gilded aerialists in their giant dirigibles — the world remained a storybook unfolding endlessly in signs and wonders over which they drifted in stylish accidie leviathan hunters relaxed as victorian naturalists and up there everything looked different the borders absurd the people in their witch-fearing villages as out-of-date as peasants in a medieval breviary the mountains too seemed surpassable offering an alternative angle on the sublime occasionally there was concern a tear in the fabric hooked to a typhoon ’ s tail above the china sea or harried by storms across the atlantic but how lighter than air they were they did not understand as they fell continually upwards how the nature of the element was the price of their rising the assiduous atom seeking an exit thronging the fabric of their cells witness was the privilege of the many newsreels captured the death of a star and — oh the humanity — its last leisurely plummet in fire its ashen armature
i.m and then the sun came slicing sideways clear water reflecting it giving it slant a gloss of rain so quick and light that day hardly made a sound the thought of sheets hung out and drying on the line of seeds in soil and soil itself the glutting ends of stems of leaves that will them to let fall up and out and through the trees the shape that shoots could take of you and this moment as it happens our echoing hush as we try to hold the close music of the blackbird in the bush • and then the sun continued on lough neagh cooled under the firm keels of fishing boats on the water ’ s taut skin their painted hulls in pointed arcs an emblem of balance so finely wrought that they could tell the weight of light or air each night we walk along the shore expecting still to find your sturdy figure waist-deep in waders plumbing darkness hauling it in but never again your grip on the reel and never again the deft music of the blackbird nesting in your hand
from the platform iron iterates way into time the tracks are staples intervaled along my father ’ s spine before me might be somebody ’ s father waited for — white choker of a condor dry lips of lifelong acolyte i barely brush his arm so as not to make him start who knows how he might play out cave in tear apart he deeds toward me wet wood breakable all in all of direst bark this is how it starts at last i recall “ i thought you were someone otherwise. ” the rail lines rattle like beetle files he frowns establishes his palms “ tell me does that happen often lamb ”
when it became my turn to speak all that my tongue produced was dust i hold my cat to this i wear finery in moments of clarity there is no grace it sits into the jar the kitten we pace as i watched the saplings become trees i found a song my father sung in my mouth no words just melody i am unuttered on black and white film we are dressed in a shadow of lace it sits into the jar the kitten we pace i hold my cat still as he becomes the names of ships that sank on their maiden voyages are not its i shall name him castro among the flotsam were documents the sea-air could not erase it sits into the jar the kitten we pace if it becomes like it was is ever shall i will partake in blood-lettings to appease the vengeful sky-god i am deep ecology our feet wet in the sand at night there was a lantern we would always chase it sits into the jar the kitten we pace when my memory becomes like my tongue dust effluvial sunken and pure melody please on sand draw the batavia for me with your hands remember the contours of my aging face we slip into the light your fingers they lace

forget about it for you ’ ll never win never hit the jackpot move in to a solar-powered eco mansion and modest philanthropy become a panjandrum of diaphanous pleasures but must sink or swim beneath mood- mutable skies coconut milk clouds in the shadow of high flats low sales bright fronts strung crowds of literally miraculous people in expensive skin like bed sheets you would wrap yourself in and which you now touch lightly as you enter this café past a clutch of mitching schoolgirls with pierced noses and tintin hairdos who look at you as if to say is it dial-a-dickhead day in here or maybe that ’ s aimed instead at the guy eating flatbread with five thousand friends on his phone who types with a grin all is well with the world when all is not well with the world — the burden of debt as your granny might say heavy as sin — although who would begrudge this incense of crushed coffee in steam this clatter and chatter latex flowers under halogen lights and who ’ d demean that woman with her small child wiping the small child ’ s chin to the delight of a lonely well-off older person or w.o.o.p — i believe they call them woopies — at the next table over who scoops two shaking spoons of sugar into a steaming cup then begins to call her son oh my lost son asking after her granddaughter while the mitching girls swagger out the door — look one forgot her phone — ah good someone caught her — and who would begrudge the yin and yang of this moment sitting here coming or going anyone and no one here or somewhere else stuck nowhere and flowing in the mix like everyone for you are blurring below indigo and ink-dim skies as time passes by like steam vapors into the run-of-the-mill gray coat you put on pausing before leaving to meet this falling day which as your granny might say is the only day you ’ re in
more than ample a deadfall of one meter eighty to split my temple apart on the herringbone parquet and crash the operating system tripping an automated shutdown in the casing and halting all external workings of the moist robot i inhabit at the moment i am out cold and when my eyes roll in again i sit on the edge of the bed and tell you just how taken i am with the place i ’ d been had been compelled to leave airlifted mid-gesture mid-sentence risen of a sudden like a bubble or its glisten or a victim snatched and bundled out helplessly from sunlight the usual day and all particulars of life there fled except the sense that stays with me for hours and hours that i was valuable and needed there
the memory of sun it is what they subsist upon down where the jaws snap blindly at whatever passes where drifter is a meaningless term and to hunt is to proffer teeth and tongue and ghost-lit lantern into a sea like liquid wind without prior compass of the way the wind is blowing should they be gifted with a corpse whose half-spoilt flesh holds distillate eternal summers spent glittering in the euphotic zone they will give gross thanks and in their way be holy in the cartography of sea they are kin not to dragons nor the stella maris but to your own bright band — yes you there eating your sunlight secondhand from a long-gone grocery display drinking it from the guts of lazy lemons

the eiffel tower erected itself in my head we couldn ’ t find the lifts climbed the stairs of course there were fireworks we stared at each other rare exhibits in the louvre — you licked my mona lisa smile right off of course we were both in imaginary chanel we drank warm cider and ate pancakes yours flambéed i got drunk my tights laddered on both legs of course we experienced tachycardia at the moulin rouge our hotel a boxed macaron on a navy boulevard — we spun around in the dark outside rain-dizzy of course we slept at the ritz our little room tucked into the corner a pink pocket you slipped into that night of course our fingers hunted for change in the mirrored elevator i couldn ’ t meet your eye i crushed you into the laminated sample menu and died of course it was only la petite mort
castaways we hit the forest — our camping stove turned low i gripped my tent close for its trial in virgin attitudes of stiffness while lamps fluttered on the dark my roof sank wave on wave accordion-like the only sin we knew and soon the jameson appeared i ’ d burned one back and by the third she laid her hand on mine like a napkin ... later i caught those tiny gasps from joan and michael ’ s tent where he slipped into her like this i thought a frog à la bashō those dark rippling walls where she kept center held her breath so i had to puzzle how one could leave and neither be alone
1 desert heat high clouds and sky the color of lapis on this journey anything seems possible so we stop by an ancient cottonwood to kiss the beauty trembles does n't say a word just watches me so open small birds fly by flock in the shady tree above us what settles in her heart what congeals hope despair far off the river churns in its sandy banks swallows veer turn in fiery air will these kisses seal her to me i her lover she my wife is all of this a dream my whole life 2 she is just this side of wonderful and suddenly the glamorous world fills itself with shining and we laugh at highway monuments that explain how hard the trek had been for franciscans in the indian wilderness poor fellows— conversion is the devil 's own work then the stones of her dream turn up under her feet the back of a huge land turtle i know we must be circling paradise because the ants enter the fleshy petals of the roadside flowers with evident joy and purpose oh my dark pretty one 3 music my adored when is there never music my accordion puffs up with drinkable melodies i spill her tunes into your listening ear one after the other the squeeze-box enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy with its hard rhythms lilts the back- breaking labor song the worker croons to earth warbles romantic notes of dissolving borders you melt like a woman beneath her lover 's touch music is happy and pitiless when it sets fire to combustible souls even the raspy bandoneon 's voice is lyric 4 sacred sacred sacred sacred speak in a whisper we slip into this space half cognizant the land is very large indeed bones of the earth worn down though she is a living thing see how she exposes her grace antelopes graze on the far plain—their high white tails—the red soil throbs its slow heartbeat and the blue sky clears so smartly perfectly like radiance are the ancestors near what can we know we decide to wander around this prairie mistaken for utes buy commodities in little towns 5 late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked malheur after the long curve of the snake river plain above the falls where the shoshone went to pray we soaked our feet in cold water and i observed the arch of her brown foot rabbitbrush and sage along the highway juniper on far hills and bluffs sundown and dusk falls over the wide basin of land in burns we eat eggs in a cafe take a room in the motel 6. in the dark i can see her black hair black against the pillows its clean scent makes me think of corn at dawn i hold her and there are kisses then more kisses then more the day is cold a north wind blew last night but the land is open rain falls in showers of light 6 her hand on my thigh my shoulder in my hair she leans over to kiss my cheek we look at each other smile for miles we travel this way nearly silent point with eyes or chins at the circling hawk the king- fisher on the snag above the swollen creek one night i weep in her arms as she cries `` oh oh oh '' because i have touched her scars lightly throat belly breasts in that communion of lovers thick sobs break from me as i think of my love back home all that i have done and can not say this is the first time i have left her so completely so alone
throughout the years i have designed high-end custom homes crafting spatial poetics with vigas and latillas hand peeled by mojados whose sweat translates into profit for developers working at a nifty rate sometimes i go visit these homes as they are being finished may i help you i am asked by the realtor standing at the door thinking that i may be the guy who mixed the mud and pushed the wheelbarrow i introduce myself as the designer oh well it ’ s so nice to meet you what a wonderful job please come in i was once asked by a home magazine journalist if i felt insulted by such incidents well no i said my mind mixing for an answer a good batch of cement is never accidental last year on my way up through santa fe i made a detour and drove by a house of my design the season ’ s first snow on the ground smoke rising out of the fireplace chimney inch by inch i know that house through its x y and z axis but i can not approach the front door knock and expect to be invited in to sit in the corner of my pleasing and lounge around with the owner as we sip on cups of hot herbal tea making small talk about the weather or discussing a reading by the latest author come through as the sun ’ s last light streams in gallantly through the window just where i placed it and for that reason i take a handful of snow to my mouth toss another into the air my blessings upon the inhabitants que dios los bendiga y les dé más my grandfather would have said i turn my car toward home to my mother ’ s house a place near and far to me she my mother is bedridden and my brother is the self-appointed caretaker to bathe and feed her bring her morsels of conversation it is their own world now ruled by a juxtaposition of understanding against what i have come to know now here so far and away i am greeted at her front yard by an old propped up trunk hood proclaiming my brother ’ s spray-painted inscription jesus saves on the opposite side it reads keep out i guess it just depends on what kind of day he ’ s having someone once remarked like a rattlesnake it ’ s a fair warning years ago i accepted this madness and called it not my own it ’ s better that he be drunk on christ said my mother than on what he used to drink we all agreed
when i learned i might have cancer i bought fifteen white lilies easter was gone the trumpets were wilted plants crooked with roots bound in pots i dug them into the garden knowing they would not bloom for another year all summer the stalks stood like ramshackle posts while i waited for results by autumn the stalks had flopped down more biopsies laser incisions the cancer in my tongue a sprawling mass outside the earth remained bare rhizomes shrunken below the frost line spring shoots appeared in bright green skins and lilies bloomed in july their waxed trumpets pure white dusting gold pollen to the ground this year tripled in number they are popping up again i wait a ceremony for the lilies to open for the serpentine length of the garden to bloom in the shape of my tongue ’ s scar a white path with one end leading into brilliant air the other down the throat ’ s canyon black and unforgiving i try to imagine what could grow in such darkness i am waiting for the lilies to open
all night vigil my two-and-a-half-year-old boy and his 10-month-old sister lay on the same bed facing opposite ends their feet touching they looked soft peaceful bundled there in strands of blankets i brushed away roaches that meandered across their faces but not even that could wake them outside the dark cover of night tore as daybreak bloomed like a rose on a stem of thorns i sat down on the backsteps gazing across the yellowed yard a 1954 chevy bel-air stared back it was my favorite possession i hated it just then it didn ’ t start when i tried to get it going earlier that night it had a bad solenoid i held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap i expected trouble from the paragons gang of the west lynwood barrio somebody said i dove the car that dudes from colonia watts used to shoot up the paragons ’ neighborhood but i got more than trouble that night my wife had left around 10 p.m. to take a friend of mine home she didn ’ t come back i wanted to kill somebody at moments it had nothing to do with the paragons it had to do with a woman i loved but who to kill not her– sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt i ’ d kill myself first kill me first but she was the one who quit kill her no think man i was hurt angry but to kill her to kill a paragon to kill anybody i went into the house and put the gun away later that morning my wife came for her things some clothes the babies their toys a radio broken tv and some dishes remained i didn ’ t stop her there was nothing to say that my face didn ’ t explain already nothing to do but run so i drove the long haul to downey and parked near an enclosed area alongside the los angeles river i got out of the car climbed over the fence and stumbled down the slopes a small line of water rippled in the middle on rainy days this place flooded and flowed but most of the time it was dry with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture since a child the river and its veins of canals were places for me to think places to heal once on the river ’ s bed i began to cleanse i ran i ran into the mist of morning carrying the heat of emotion through the sun ’ s rays i ran past the factories that lay smack in the middle of somebody ’ s backyard i ran past alleys with overturned trashcans and mounds of tires debris lay underfoot overgrown weeds scraped my legs as i streamed past recalling the song of bullets that whirred in the wind i ran across bridges beneath overhead passes and then back alongside the infested walls of the concrete river splashing rainwater as i threaded my heels colliding against the pavement so much energy propelled my legs and just like the river it went on for miles when all was gone the concrete river was always there and me always running

in the middle of rolling grasslands away from lights a moonless night untethers its wild polka-dots the formations we can name competing for attention in a twinkling and crowded sky-bowl out from the corners our eyes detect a maverick meteor a transient streak and lying back toward midnight on the heft of car hood all conversation blunted we are at once unnerved and somehow restored out here a furrow of spring-fed river threads through ranches in the tens of thousands of acres like cattle we are powerless by instinct can see why early people trembled and deliberated the heavens off in the distance those cattle make themselves known a bird song moves singular across the horizon not yet 2:00 and bits of comet dust the perseids startle and skim the atmosphere like skipping stones in the leaden dark we are utterly alone as i rub the ridges on the back of your hand our love for all things warm and pulsing crescendos toward dawn this timeless awe your breath floating with mine upward into the stars
i 'm remembering again the day we stood on the porch and you smoked while the old man told you about his basement full of wine his bad heart and the doctor 's warning how he held the dusty bottle out to you glad he said to give it away to someone who appreciated its value and spirit the years it took to settle into its richness and worth i 'm watching again each cell alive as you reach for the wine your forearm exposed below the rolled sleeve the fine hairs that sweep along the muscle glowing lifting a little in the afternoon breeze i 'm memorizing the shape of the moment your hand and the small bones lengthening beneath the skin as it tightens in the gripping in the receiving of the gift the exact texture and color of your skin and the old man 's face reduced to its essence that and the brief second when both of you had a hand on the bottle— the thing not yet given not yet taken but held between you stoppered full and my body is flooded again with an elemental joy holding onto it against another day in the unknowable future when i 'm given terrible news some dark burden i 'll be forced to carry i know this is useless and ca n't possibly work but i 'm saving that moment for balance
for richard before the days of self service when you never had to pump your own gas i was the one who did it for you the girl who stepped out at the sound of a bell with a blue rag in my hand my hair pulled back in a straight unlovely ponytail this was before automatic shut-offs and vapor seals and once while filling a tank i hit a bubble of trapped air and the gas backed up came arcing out of the hole in a bright gold wave and soaked me — face breasts belly and legs and i had to hurry back to the booth the small employee bathroom with the broken lock to change my uniform peel the gas-soaked cloth from my skin and wash myself in the sink light-headed scrubbed raw i felt pure and amazed — the way the amber gas glazed my flesh the searing subterranean pain of it how my skin shimmered and ached glowed like rainbowed oil on the pavement i was twenty in a few weeks i would fall for the first time in love that man waiting patiently in my future like a red leaf on the sidewalk the kind of beauty that asks to be noticed how was i to know it would begin this way every cell of my body burning with a dangerous beauty the air around me a nimbus of light that would carry me through the days how when he found me weeks later he would find me like that an ordinary woman who could rise in flame all he would have to do is come close and touch me

she never spoke which made her obvious the way death makes the air obvious in an empty chair the way sky compressed between bare branches is more gray or blue the way a window is more apparent than a wall she held her silence to her breast like a worn coat smoke an armful of roses her silence colored the smaller silences that came and went that other students stood up and filled in i leaned near the window in my office she sat on the edge of a chair hips rigid fidgeting while i made my little speech february light pressed its cold back against the glass sealing us in she focused on my lips as i spoke as if to study how it 's done the sheer mechanics of it orchestration of jaw and tongue teeth shifting in tandem shaping the air so i stopped let her silence drift over us let it sift in like smoke or snow let its petals settle on my shoulders i looked outside to the branches of a stripped tree winter starlings folded in their speckled wings chilled flames shuddering at the tips students wandered across campus as if under water hands and hair unfurling their soundless mouths churning— irate or ecstatic i could n't tell—ready to burn it all down or break into song when i looked back her eyes had found the window tree students birds swimming by mute in their element it was painful to hear the papery rasp of her folding and unfolding hands to watch color smudging her neck and temple branching to mist the delicate rim of one ear i listened to the air sunder between us the feverish hush collapse i could hear her breath—smoke rising from ice i could see what it cost her to make that leap what heat it takes for the body to blossom into speech
nothing is nothing although he would call me that she was nothing those were his words but his hand was lifting cigarettes in chains and bridges of ash-light he said he did n't want his body to last it was n't a year i could argue against that kind of talk so i cut the fowl killed on the farm a mile out—brown and silvery wild— and put it over butter lettuce lettuce then lime i heated brandy in the saucepan poured a strip of molasses slowly through the cold slow as i 'd seen a shaman pour pine tincture over the floor of my beaten house she seemed to see my whole life by ordinance of some god who wanted me alive again burnt sage blue smoke then sea salt shaken into the corners of violent sadness she wrote my address across her chest to let everything listening know where my life was made we waited either forgetting what we were or becoming more brightly human in that pine in her trance in the lavender i set on the chipped sills not a trance at all but my deliberate hand cutting from the yard part of what she required now wait longer she said and i did as i would when the molasses warmed over the pot enough to come into the brandy to come into the night begun by small confessions— that this was just a rental and mine just a floor that the woman he loved was with another man his mother mad his apartment haunted in the crawl space then i told of the assault at daybreak between the houses heat asphalt all of it and my face toward the brick school where the apostolate studied first-century script and song there must have been chanting as it was on the hour what we said was liturgy meant only for us and for that night not for anyone else to repeat live by believe never that our only theories were inside of our hands flesh and land body and prairie i reached to smoke down his next-to-last which he lit and made ready the poultry like a war ration we ate all the way through what we wished we said what we said we found that night by these and no other means

1 when i spoke the words i am gay i had let them fester like blood on a prison cell wall i hadn ’ t known that they would free themselves they scaled the swollen gutter of my throat and shot themselves right through uncle andy ’ s diaphragm holding the air in lungs hostage so he had no words left of his own he could only unfurl his vinegar lips to sputter silent thank yous across my brow i kissed the darkness three times because it stole those three merciless words from me before my mother could she told me that i would never survive a new york winter mother painted face and gossamer cheeks it wasn ’ t you walking down the hall to economics when you heard a familiar voice a voice that told jokes you always laughed at in class and he said i can tolerate faggots but if they flirt with me i wouldn ’ t hesitate to beat them down i swore that was the best joke i ’ d ever heard because my stomach laughed itself into hollow tree trunk and then nothingness mother painted face and gossamer cheeks you wouldn ’ t know that i hated him more than he hated me 2 let me tell you what makes me measure my existence by the pauses when the silence between each stammering heartbeat screams like a head snapping forward the taste of gangrene is much too sweet so it ’ s better to slide my fingers across my swollen gutter throat aching for that ticking pulse to just stand still when each throb of the heart will dance to the cadence of euthanasia but the rabid pounding against my ribcage fists upon flesh bare-chested is the wielding of hammer and chisel he is a blacksmith and it is he who wrought my personhood 3 i can ’ t tell you who i am but i can tell you that as i sat in that lavender bedroom when my mother spit that quivering prayer fix my boy fix my boy i knew then the worst combinations of words always came in threes but i made of only jagged elbows clicking jawbone and slivers of teenage torso i pieced each slab of soiled skin back together and i hissed at her i am consummate and i am beauty and you can not fix what is not broken and i can tell you that once a woman christened me angel and told me what my mother couldn ’ t that the venom in my veins was only stardust she had all of her angels turn their eyes up to that slice of heaven and we screamed yes yes yes until we became phoenixes rising from the ashes of our yesterdays and i can tell you that my little brother has the voice of weathered sidewalks rich with the cracks of prepuberty and smooth like innocence unsullied and his i believe in you could sing every spilled breath to sleep i can tell you that my mother could very well be right when she told me i would never survive a new york winter because i am only jagged elbows clicking jawbone and slivers of teenage torso but there is one thing i know for certain that boy who let those three merciless words scale his swollen gutter of a throat he is a blacksmith and he has taught me everything fix my boy 2014 by ana hinojosa
this time i came to the starting place with my best running shoes and pure speed held back for the finish came with only love of the clock and the underfooting and the other runners each of us would be testing excellence and endurance in the other though in the past i ’ d often veer off to follow some feral distraction down a side path allowing myself to pursue something odd or beautiful becoming acquainted with a few of the ways not to blame myself for failing to succeed i had come to believe what ’ s beautiful had more to do with daring to take yourself seriously to stay the course whatever the course might be the person in front seemed ready to fade his long graceful stride shortening as i came up along his side i was sure now i ’ d at least exceed my best time but the man with the famous final kick already had begun his move beautiful i heard a spectator say as if something inevitable about to come from nowhere was again on its way
october–november 1975 autobus on paseo de la reforma with destination signs bellas artes insurgentes exactamente just what ’ s needed insurgent arts poesía insurgente this is not it ... 1 bus to veracruz via puebla xalapa ... adobe house by highway with no roof and one wall covered with words la luz del mundo 2 passing through puebla late sunday afternoon a band concert in a plaza next to a ferris wheel — i have passed through many places like this i have seen the toy trains in many amusement parks when you ’ ve seen them all you ’ ve seen one 3 halfway to xalapa a great white volcano snow peak looms up above the hot altiplano — white god haunting indian dreams 4 a boy and three burros run across a stubble field away from the white mountain he holds a stick there is no other way 5 deep yellow flowers in the dusk by the road beds of them stretching away into darkness a moon the same color comes up 6 as the bus turns turns down the winding hill moon swings wildly from side to side it has had too many pathetic phallusies written about it to stand still for one more 7 in xalapa i am a head taller than anyone else in town — a foot of flesh and two languages separate us 8 at a stand in the park at the center of xalapa i eat white corn on the cob with a stick in the end sprinkled with salt butter grated cheese hot sauce the dark stone indian who hands it to me has been standing there three thousand years 9 i ’ m taking this trip from mexico city to the gulf of mexico and back without any bag or person — only what i can carry in my pockets the need for baggage is a form of insecurity 10 two hours in this town and i feel i might live forever foreign places affect me that way the tall church tower tolls its antique sign pray 11 in early morning in the great garden of xalapa with its terraces and immense jacaranda trees pines palms there are black birds with cries like bells and others with hollow wooden voices like gourds knocked together the great white volcano shimmers far off unreached by the rising sun 12 brown men in white palmetto cowboy hats stand about the fountains in groups of three or four their voices lost to the hollow-sounding birds along a sunlit white stone balustrade student lovers are studying each other novios awaiting the day the sun beats down hot and melts not the mountain 13 on the bus again to veracruz dropping down fast to flat coast a tropical feeling — suddenly coffee plantation palms — everything small except the landscape horses the size of burros small black avocados small strong men with machetes — each still saying to himself me llamo yo
the sea was one thing once the field another either way something got crossed or didn ’ t who ’ s to say about happiness whatever country i mean where inconceivable was a word like any other lies far behind me now i ’ ve learned to spare what ’ s failing if it can keep what ’ s living alive still maybe just awhile longer ghost bamboo that the birds nest in for example not noticing the leaves color of surrender color of poverty as i used to imagine it when i myself was poor but had no idea of it i ’ ve always thought gratitude ’ s the one correct response to having been made however painfully to see this life more up close the higher gods having long refused me let the gods deemed lesser do the best they can — so a friend i somewhere along the way lost hold of used to drunkenly announce usually just before passing out i think he actually believed that stuff he must surely by now be dead there ’ s a rumored humbling effect to loss that i bear no trace of it ’ s not loss that humbles me what used to look like memory — clouds for hours breaking gathering then breaking up again — lately seems instead like a dance one of those slower too complicated numbers i never had much time for not knowing exactly what it ’ s come to is so much different from understanding that it ’ s come to nothing why is it then each day they feel more the same
after “ exile ’ s letter ” by ezra pound to tom s. of missouri possum friend clerk at lloyd ’ s now i remember that you rang a silent bell by the foot of the bridge at the river “ thames. ” with dull roots and dried tubers you wrote poems and laments and grew more english month on month bowing to kings and princes americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west border and with them and with me especially everything was pig-headed and i made hay from poppycock and painted adjectives just so we could start a new fellowship and we all escaped our personalities without expressing them and then i was sent off to rapallo trailed by children and you to your desk at faber-faber till we had nothing but china and silence in common and then when modernism had come to its worst we wrote and published in po-etry through all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silence into a poem of a thousand blank pages that was the first heave and into ten thousand poems full of chinese reticence and with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouth out from the east came confucius and his philosophy and there came also the “ true-man ” ben-it-o to awe me playing in the death-mask of jefferson in the botched houses of europe they gave us more foetid music clanging instruments like the sound of a myriad dying my forefather confucius got me drunk and i danced because my savage mind wouldn ’ t keep still without his music playing and i wrapped in silence woke up with my head on his lap and my voice returning to me from every radio and before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards or bombs i had to be off to china so far across my desktop you back to your london-bridge and our roosevelt who was brave as a rodent was president in washing town and let in the usurious rabble and one may he sent the soldiers for me despite the long distance and what with broken idols and so on i won ’ t say it wasn ’ t hard going over roads twisted like my brain ’ s folds and i was still going late in the war with defeat blowing in from the north not guessing how little i knew of the cost and how soon i would be paying it and what a reception steel cages two books set on a packing-crate table and i was caught and had no hope of escaping and you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cell toward the alpine peak with clouds about it as foul as london air with you whispering and with a bang not a whimper with glasses like dinner plates glowing grass-green in the darkness pleasure-fasting with women coming and going without speech with the dandruff-flakes falling like snow and the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silence and the sea knee-deep reflecting white eyebrows — eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlight hideously aged — and the sea-girls singing back at us drowning in seaweed brocade and the wind twisting the song and desiccating it covering our eyes with dust and this is the way the world ends with a bang not with a whimper i went up to the court for prosecution tried standing mute offered a madman ’ s song and got no conviction and went back to saint elizabeths committed and once again later you stood at the foot of my bed and then the visit ended you went back to bloomsbury and if you ask if i recall that parting it is like the hair falling from my hieratic head confused ... whirl centripetal mate what is the use of talking until i end my song i end my song in the dark i call in the nurse hold the pill in my hand as she says “ take this ” and swallow it down silent
slade was pulling minnows out of the dry river the day we met puddles more or less was what was left but what could live wanted to and tried treading narrow circles a glide of brittle ﬁns he wore those rubber boots though the sun was an anvil and very little wet he smiled i remember that his nickel smile right at me his ﬁngers letting fall the small ﬁsh muscles into a bag ﬁlled with yellow tap i didn ’ t ask his name or what it was he thought he was doing but we talked i listened as he taught me to relax the hand just enough they can smell he said the oils our pores release when we tense to catch you have to believe it he said you don ’ t mean any harm
born of the sun we traveled a short while toward the sun where there were seasons and sky where there were monuments like a single engine plane in a july haze or our nights that pile up like shoes in a guest room i would talk about the weather when i ’ m in the right weather but when at the stanhope hotel just hours before they were people the navy divers found them lying under one hundred and sixteen feet of waves or a small body of water meeting a new larger body healthy body nobody we just couldn ’ t decide spatial disorientation occurs when you don ’ t refer to your instruments and begin to believe the whatever inside you when i punished the austrian roses by forgetting about them i knew that they couldn ’ t keep beauty and they couldn ’ t keep time the day of his father ’ s funeral november 25 1963 was also his third birthday then — sometimes the urge for new windows a color other than black for the best days in fourteen seconds plummeting at a rate beyond the safe maximum the safe maximum at the office bedroom or bar on the way there somewhere between floors no velocity could recover us and again sometimes the right music sometimes lucky to be in good light once a week i go into a room and pretend to have similar interests every day i wake up and brush to the left we ’ re the good people the bad people and the people we aren ’ t socialite journalist lawyer americans these americans they always button their coats when they see luck dear johnny boy thanks for asking me to be your mother but i ’ m afraid i could never do her justice my eyebrows aren ’ t thick enough for one but you know it was like eating the best grapefruit being here here here and then what “ ... yet once you start answering those questions ... where do you stop ” the old photograph of a young salute that one send-off to death family the beginning of character maybe you know it ’ s the last year of the century so come late and leave early others flying similar routes reported no visual horizon it ’ s the last luxury to go early and never come back

i out of scarcity — ... being because when you were nine your father was murdered betrayed because the traveler was betrayed by those with whom he had the right to seek refuge the tatárs because the universe then allowed a creature stronger taller more ruthless than you to fasten around your neck a thick wooden wheel impossible to throw off because at nine your cunning was not equal to iron-fastened immense wood because stripped of what was his from birth the slave at ten outwitted the universe tore the wheel from his neck — because your neck carries it still scarcity is the mother of being • hour in which betrayal and slavery are the great teachers hour in which acquisition looks like and for a moment is safety hour in which the earth looking into a mirror names what it sees by the history of weapons hour from which i can not wake ii ch ’ ang-ch ’ un was determined that he would not prostrate himself before the conqueror of the world though alexander the great drunk had executed aristotle ’ s nephew when he refused to grovel before his uncle ’ s pupil • ch ’ ang-ch ’ un bowed his head with clasped hands the great khan was gracious though ch ’ ang-ch ’ un much younger had refused invitations from the king of gold and even the emperor of hang-chou now in his old age he discovered he was tired of waiting for apotheosis at last invited to court by the terrifying conqueror of the world he said yes • he traveled for a year and a half following the route the great khan himself had taken he passed valley after valley that years later still were filled with ungathered whitening bones • he bowed his head with clasped hands the most powerful man on earth then asked him to teach him the secret of the taoist masters — the elixir that allows men to cheat death temujin was in pain temujin for fifty years lived as if immortal — though surrounded all his life by death now he had fallen from a horse the injury had not entirely after much time healed he brooded about death his death now he must conquer the ancient secret that would bend heaven to his need he asked ch ’ ang-ch ’ un for the fabled elixir iii the world he was born at the great world ’ s poor far edge in order to see the rich debris that must lie at the bottom of the sea he sucked and sucked till he swallowed the ocean • buddhists taoists muslims nestorians — he summoned each each eloquent spokesman praised abnegations offered transformation even ecstasies — just renounce sex or food or love • eating power he fucked a new woman every night best he said was the wife or daughter or mother of an enemy • he watched his friend bo ’ orchu hunt each day as if hunting were the purpose of life work sufficient for a man as a boy he discovered his work when he had a wooden wheel around his neck to escape the wheel every single thing tastes like reeks with the power that put it there weapons keep in place who gets rewarded how much for what the world • is good at telling itself this is a lie the world iv each unit made up of ten ten soldiers whose leader reports to a unit of one hundred soldiers whose leader reports to a unit of one thousand soldiers whose leader reports to a unit of ten thousand with iron logic he had raised the great structure from the flat internecine earth — abyss where absolute necessary power is fettered bewildered by something working within us mud in the veins to paralyze decision — as well as by that necessary sweet daring that leaps across the abyss to risk all to correct and cripple power — ... but then finds in despair it must try to master it v though temujin ’ s father alive was khan the remnant of his family was at his poisoning driven from the circle of the wagons temujin had shining eyes but at nine no force they survived by eating roots berries stray rodents birds the boys ’ cunning pulled from the air • temujin ’ s father out of his mother had two sons his poisoned father out of his second wife also had two sons • one day with a freshly sharpened juniper arrow he brought down a lark and his half-brother bekter nearly his age reaching the bird first refused to give it up temujin ran to his mother who told him he must accept this that four boys with two women alone must cease fighting with his bow and arrow the next day temujin murdered his half-brother • his half-brother at each moment relentlessly disputed and clearly forever would dispute everything temujin possessed • when he confessed to his mother she shrieked only his shadow ever again could bear to be with him he didn ’ t believe her she lived blinded by panic he looked around him human beings live by killing other living beings • his father ’ s rival who told his father that temujin had shining eyes when his father died decided he now could make temujin a slave temujin rammed the wheel down on the idiot guard ’ s skull sorqan-shira and his sons found him drowning among reeds at the edge of the river frenzied risking their lives sorqan-shira and his sons work to cut away the wheel from his body • the arrow flew as if of itself temujin ’ s half-brother turned and saw temujin ’ s unerring aim aimed at his chest before the arrow was released his half-brother did not beg to live his half-brother ’ s gaze was filled with everything that would happen would happen • in the delirium of temujin ’ s adult dreams the knife he stole escaping is useless in unlocking the wheel • how each child finds that it must deal with the intolerable becomes its fate • w o r l d with this a r r o w i thee wed. vi even the conqueror of the world is powerless against the dead the most intricate plan his friend jamuqa ever accomplished was to make temujin execute him • they met as boys by the frozen waters of the onon temujin gave jamuqa the knucklebone of a deer jamuqa gave temujin the knucklebone of a deer they could see their breaths they mingled breaths they swore they were anda brothers they sharpened arrows — juniper cypress • when they met again many years later temujin ’ s wife borte had been seized by another tribe jamuqa commanded a whole tribe he pledged his friend twenty thousand men temujin also by this time was chief but of many fewer the two friends and two armies found and freed borte after nine months the anda celebrated by the waters of the onon • they were too drunk too happy jamuqa pulled a blanket over himself and temujin they lay all night under the same blanket • for either to have expressed desire to have reached would have been to offer the object of desire power it could not be done • jamuqa forever wants them to do it to them together in tandem two couples next to each other — so temujin can and must look over and see his insouciant bravado as he dismounts hear jamuqa ’ s girl cry out first more jaggedly • when the chiefs gather to choose for the first time in decades a great khan to jamuqa ’ s surprise temujin is chosen someone points out his family is royal — jamuqa is merely descended from a favorite concubine • at feasts jamuqa thinks supplicants shuffle him aside to reach temujin as the world more and more defers to temujin jamuqa becomes in his own eyes a ghost he is the memory of jamuqa • in the new army under temujin aristocracy has few privileges a friend who has fought under jamuqa for years must to rise compete against peasants panache the sweet disdain for mere consequences gain victory is lost • many like the tribe that tried to enslave him will never accept temujin whenever a new group rebels temujin finds jamuqa is in their company • men don ’ t want to serve under jamuqa — because his friend would not fight against the great khan he cut off the friend ’ s head and hung it from his horse ’ s tail • jamuqa joined the nayman army jamuqa deserted the nayman army • an outcast with five last remaining followers jamuqa in the high snowy tangu mountains at the very limit of his native country as he eats a wild ram he has killed and roasted is taken prisoner by his companions and delivered to temujin vii your father seized your mother as a girl just after her marriage to someone from her own tribe this was common practice just after your marriage the same tribe seized your wife and gave her to the brother of the chief all proceeded from desire — from deferred justice the chancre of unclosed injury this bred enmity through generation after generation blood feuds tribe against tribe against tribe as the great khan temujin outlawed such seizures he did what was there to be done • the axes of your work work that throughout the illusory chaos of your life absorbed your essential mind were there always — what was there to be done you saw many men refuse or try to refuse what needed to be done whether they could not find it or were finding it disgusted they without it wandered like jamuqa • when temujin entered the dark room the prisoner was naked his genitals hung pendant bulbous — as if swollen from rubbing he still is a creature that is beautiful but all dirty • jamuqa said what you must do is kill me i will never accede to your power alive i will rally your enemies dead i will in their eyes just be one more fool temujin replied that he could not they had been since boyhood anda without him would he have recovered borte jamuqa replied that he did not want his skin broken during execution he repeated twice i will never accede to your power temujin refused jamuqa was sick in the head healthy men don ’ t want to die • jamuqa escaped two men who temujin valued died bringing him back then jamuqa escaped again when jamuqa was returned again temujin hesitated for months then he granted his wish • he insisted the skin not be broken when he saw the body the head was severed as if someone for some reason had been furious • temujin was furious with him for letting pride some sickness of the mind poison feeling — ... they had been since boyhood anda • even the conqueror of the world is powerless against the dead he saw smelt the carcass of jamuqa — ... who had known that temujin was too smart not to be by his death forever tormented • he watched you take from him what he thought was his — the world of indolent chaos inhabited by the beautiful and lucky — fuck anything that walks if that is whatever inside you demands in the end the something that was broken in him was mute he insisted that it did not exist viii there was an immense silence between temujin and borte • in the beginning sweetness because there had been no need to talk • temujin ’ s father had taken him at nine on a journey to find temujin a bride • she was ten and beautiful • his father and her father were old allies and it was agreed • on the way home the tatárs poisoned his father • temujin was sixteen when they were at last married • within days borte was abducted • borte was abducted because when their camp was attacked there was only one free horse • temujin thrust the horse at his mother not his wife • this was as it should be • borte knew this accepted this • when she returned from those who had seized her she returned about to give birth • temujin did not ask what humiliations she had endured • whose child was it • it could have been temujin ’ s or the creature ’ s who took her • temujin declared the child a son his • he needed to be perceived among his own people as someone of impeccable justice • someone whose rectitude is above vanity • they had three more sons • he needed legitimate sons • borte raised as well orphans that temujin ’ s soldiers plucked from burning villages that they themselves had burned • those thus saved proved to be among the fiercest the most loyal of his soldiers • after borte returned the armies of temujin and jamuqa camped together for a year and a half • borte and temujin ’ s mother found the closeness between the two men humiliating an insult an embarrassment • borte and temujin ’ s mother told temujin that as long as he was tied to this debauched fickle friendship the other chiefs never would choose temujin as the great khan • it was the first month of spring • the two armies had to move off to fresh grazing • temujin furious listened to the two women as if he were a statue • he heard jamuqa say that camp pitched on the slopes of the mountain gave the herders of horses what they wanted but camp pitched on the banks of the river was better for the herders of sheep • the women said that when night fell and jamuqa ’ s wagon stopped to pitch camp temujin ’ s wagon should continue • temujin ’ s wagon as jamuqa ’ s wagon stopped to pitch camp on a mountainside continued • as the night passed the clans realized what was happening and frightened debated to stop with jamuqa or stop with temujin • schisms within a tribe even sometimes within a clan • one shaman dreamt that a cow white as snow struck at jamuqa ’ s wagon until it broke one of its horns bellowing that jamuqa had to give back its lost horn striking the ground with its hoof • the shaman dreamt that a white bull followed temujin ’ s wagon bellowing that heaven and earth have decided the empire should be temujin ’ s • when temujin heard this he promised the shaman thirty concubines • as day broke and temujin at last stopped count could be taken of which clans followed temujin and which stopped with jamuqa • temujin camped near the sources of the onon • the clans who had chosen temujin in the disorder and uncertainty of the night now were joined by others • they had weighed the situation • temujin was famous for the care and probity of his decisions • the princes of the royal blood joined temujin • many days passed before temujin looked directly at borte when they spoke • she was the vehicle of necessity • of what had to be • he would not forgive her • in time he lost interest in forgiving her • when he returned from his last long campaign which lasted eight unbroken years he was grateful she did not ask about each night ’ s new woman • in time near the sources of the onon the princes of the royal blood elected temujin great khan • fame clung to the story of how he saved the beautiful borte • the irony was not lost on borte that as mother of orphans she was married to the force that made them orphans ix only at the age of thirty-nine temujin at last was master of all mongolia the emissaries of the kings of gold had played tribe against tribe all his life to castrate them to achieve unity to achieve the empire essential to maintain unity half the tribes had to be massacred • the tatárs killed his father then after subduing them followed by their unending involuted betrayals and rebellions temujin without sorrow exterminated them every male standing higher than a wagon axle was killed the rest enslaved • extermination is not a question of vengeance it is a question of safety of not allowing what happened to happen • under temujin the mongols crossed the great wall that the kingdom of gold over centuries built to contain them before them the lush cultivated great plain stretched five hundred miles — ... from beijing to nanking • between the mongols and the kings of gold lay a trench of blood inexpiable wrongs fifty years earlier betraying tatárs handed off the mongol khan ambaqay to beijing ’ s king of gold — ... who impaled him on a wooden ass • temujin drummed into his troops past atrocities after they took huai-lai the ground for some ten miles around was for years still strewn with human bones • the full fury of the mongols was reserved for the great cities of islam their sultan had twice murdered temujin ’ s emissaries — what rose in temujin was the rage to annihilate not just the civilization that insulted him but what made it possible ... in the end there was little left for his tax collectors in the future to tax this was a world everywhere on the edge of desert — the mongols in fury dismantled the intricate networks that preserved and gathered and channeled water without dams without the multitudinous screens of trees that were the handiwork of centuries for samarkand for the cities of scheherazade not just defeat but dismemberment • nightmare from which not even the rich awoke • ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... stonework of hive-like intrication its hard face airy as lace indifferent hooves erased to sand x ch ’ ang-ch ’ un thought if he answered honestly he would be executed he asked temujin to tell him temujin ’ s story the great khan to his own surprise wasn ’ t offended he liked the earnest old man seized suddenly absorbed with relish he began to tell the old man his story omitting nothing he imagined essential the taoist master at last answered that there exists no elixir for eternal life he told him that the largest square has no corners he told him that they go east and west at the will of the wind so that in the end they know not if the wind carries them or they the wind but as temujin listened to his own voice tell his story the lineaments of his story this is what he heard — because you could not master whatever enmeshed you you became its slave — you learned this bitterly early in order not to become its slave you had to become its master you became its master even as master of course you remain its slave • a s h. what yesterday was the lockstep logic of his every position purity in which he took just pride cunning solutions to what the universe thrust at him appeared to him now ash not his or if his not his • too often now he woke with his mouth gasping above water the great wooden wheel around his neck now buoy now too heavy to lift jamuqa ’ s face mutilated — jamuqa with whom he lay under the same blanket the familiar universe began to assume its shape inherent enmity of equals each master not a master a fraud a master slave • his own voice said it • old he included himself in his scorn for those who young want the opposite of this earth then settle for more of it • the life he had not led could not even now lead was a burning-glass between himself and the sun • temujin saw that the taoist master was terrified the old man facing the verge had leapt into the sea — he had given the conqueror of the world simply what he had already he liked the old man after dallying for months discussing the dead surrounding them he allowed him to return to his own country • master slave you who have survived thus far the lottery of who will live and who will die — contemplate genghis khan great ocean khan born temujin master slave xi the death of his grandson mutugen seemed to temujin harbinger of his own death this boy raised in a desert dust-storm was innocent of dust he who made one imagine something undeformed could emerge from deformity died by an arrow that he should die — that he should die assaulting a muslim citadel meant that temujin himself bareheaded took part in the final attack that destroyed it that every living thing therein man and beast the child slain in its mother ’ s womb must die — that no loot no booty should be taken but everything inexorably erased a place thereafter forever accursed • when temujin heard of his grandson ’ s death he learned it before the boy ’ s own father he called all his sons to share a meal and at it announced that he was angry his sons no longer obeyed him jaghatay mutugen ’ s father protested then temujin told jaghatay that the boy was dead gazing fixedly temujin with a choked voice forbade jaghatay grief forbade him not just the signs of grief but grief itself he kept them at table for hours at the end jaghatay when temujin left the room wept • he now knew how he wanted to be buried he wanted the course of the onon temporarily diverted — there at its muddy center burial in a sealed chamber then the river sent back over it any travelers encountering by chance the funeral cortege were to be executed xii imagination clings to apotheosis — ... those who inherit the powerful dead imagine them and cling hero to his people — ... curse except in imagination to everyone else the dream i dreamed was not denied me it was not in the mind denied me • this is the end of the fourth hour of the night
when heavy tells a story the millwright shanty under the electric furnaces chokes with quiet amid the roar as heavy pauses adjusts his mountainous weight over a creaky grease-stained metal chair and looks up at the whirling ceiling fan next to fluorescent lights hanging by wires his fingers lace like so many sausages across the canvas of blue workshirt on his chest heavy tells his story and the voice of reason quickens the demise of foulness from red-faced millwrights just back from a repair job and sitting around for the five air whistles that again call them to combat on the furnace floor all laughter stops all nonsense sayings and cuts of wisdom cease their echo when heavy tells a story heavy talks about the mexican melter who once had an affair with the pit boss ’ s wife the heart of the problem–and the fact from which the story ’ s plot revolves– was that the melter lived across the street from the pit boss one night just before the graveyard shift the melter left his home kissed his wife ’ s round face and proceeded to walk to the bus stop but a bullet pierced through his hardhat and he fell like an overturned stack of fire bricks onto the pavement the moral of this story never have an affair with someone whose old man lives within shooting distance heavy tells a story about a furnace foreman who always yelled at the laborers for failing to clean the bag house of the built-up filth from hours of cooking scrap iron and ore. the men told him it was too dangerous to walk on the tin-roofed panels their weight could cause them to fall some 30 feet into the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below “ nonsense ” the foreman yelled “ you ’ re all just lazy polacks. ” he called everyone polacks the foreman then proceeded to walk across the roof as the men stood nearby with mouths open near the safety of side beams “ you see ” he said standing in the middle as hydraulics moved shutters up and down to capture the sulphur dust then the foreman moved forward and before anyone could shout he crashed through the roof screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal the oxygen in his body making popping sounds as it entered the furnace operates continued to pour ladles of scrap iron and to melt the steel they skimmed the slag off the top and when it was ready they poured the molten mass into ingot molds there was nothing they could do for the foreman they said production had to keep going heavy looks into the eyes of his listeners and says somewhere there ’ s a skyscraper in downtown la with steel beams made from the ingot with the foreman ’ s body in it somewhere there ’ s a bridge or underground pipe with the man ’ s remains chemically bound within the molecular structure heavy tells a story and the men lay down their tools and coffee is poured into heavy ceramic cups the shanty stills beneath the rumbling and even foremen stop by to pay a listen when heavy tells a story

the unsympathetic wind how she has evaded me for years now leaving a guileless shell and no way to navigate once when i stood on a plateau of earth just at the moment before the dangerous jutting peaks converged upon the lilting sway of grasslands i almost found a way back there the sky quite possibly all the elements caused the rock and soil and vegetation to congregate their prayer was not new and so faint i could hardly discern simple remembrances like a tiny syncopated chorus calling everyone home across a thousand eastward miles and what little wind was left at my back but i could not move and then the music was gone all that was left were the spring time faces of mountains gazing down their last patches of snow luminous i dreamed of becoming snow melt gliding down the slope and in to the valley with the promise an assurance that there is always a way to become bird tree water again
the age of portrait is drugged beauty is symmetry so rare it ’ s a mystery my left eye is smaller than my right my big mouth shows my nice teeth perfectly aligned like muslims in prayer my lips an accordion each sneeze a facial thumbprint one corner of my mouth hangs downward when i want to hold a guffaw hostage bell ’ s palsy perhaps or what mark twain said about steamboat piloting that a doctor ’ s unable to look upon the blush in a young beauty ’ s face without thinking it could be a fever a malar rash a butterfly announcing a wolf can i lie facedown now as cadavers posed on first anatomy lesson i didn ’ t know mine was a woman until three weeks later we turned her over out of reverence there was to be no untimely exposure of donors our patrons who were covered in patches of scrubs-green dish towels and by semester ’ s end we were sick of all that tossed mega livers and mammoth hearts into lab air and caught them my body was margaret that ’ s what the death certificate said when it was released before finals the cause of her death nothing memorable frail old age but the colonel on table nineteen with an accessory spleen had put a bullet through his temple a final prayer not in entry or exit were there skull cracks to condemn the house of death no shattered glass in the brain only a smooth tunnel of deep violet that bloomed in concentric circles the weekends were lonely he had the most beautiful muscles of all 32 bodies that were neatly arranged zipped up as if a mass grave had been disinterred or when unzipped and facing the ceiling had cloth over their eyes as if they ’ d just been executed gray silver hair chiseled countenance he was sixty-seven a veteran of more than one war i had come across that which will end me ex­- tend me at least once without knowing it
august is the cruelest month never enough daylight too much heat no holidays and nothing matters except september ’ s dawning responsibilities but the august of 1994 i was holden caulfield summer camp senior counselor for the junior trail blazers black and brown children two weeks shy of first second and third grade nothing is as positive as motivating a force within one ’ s life as a school bus full of kids singing along to the local radio station blazing hip-hop and r b imagine this cherubic chorus riding upstate to ini kamoze ’ s “ here comes the hotstepper. ” “ muuur-derah ” my workday is filled with hazards like chocolate melted sticky swim trunk pockets insistent sunburn and the assorted rah rah of parental unsupervision but those bus rides back from upstate water parks and pools were my favorite times working have you ever ridden in a cheesebus with ashy children asleep against you staring at sudden trees — more numerous than project windows — blurring along the highways like confusion giving way to doubt the heady smell of dried chlorine and musty towels lulling you into the soft timbre of a midwest falsetto tell me what it is to fall in love with a lightskin girl covering the isley brothers i was not two weeks into 21 years old i had yet to wear a box cutter in my fifth pocket or see a semi-automatic aimed at my center mass to feel its dumbness against my spine my life was uncertain save for its unlikely length under my control like the pilot who falls short of what he says what he says he ’ s all about all about all my homeboys were still alive just like aaliyah dana haughton not yet an angel of the cruelest august begging a boy who may not be in the mood to learn what he thinks he knows to look beyond his world and try to find a place for her

1. it is cold enough for rain to coagulate and fall in heavy drops tonight a skin of ice will grow over the bones of the smallest bush making it droop like the wrist of someone carrying a heavy suitcase this moving on from season to season is exhausting and violent the break from the berlin wall of winter especially like a frostbitten hand coming to life i color first with warmth then with pain thawing letting the great powers go their own way in rivers and in flesh frightens me as this day warns me of an icy night 2. each year i am astonished at the havoc wrought on other lives fathers made tiny by cancer a mother swollen around a bad heart `` brought on by aggravation '' to suffer is to do something new yet always the same— a change of life from the sexual dread some women wish they were men some men wish they were dead still there is coin in suffering it makes us rich as croesus in his golden tears and we are rarely hated for it this coin i store in a purse made of my mother's milk and flesh which god says i must not mix i use it instead to seek pleasure 3. walking around with this thing in me all day this loving cup full of jelly waiting for you to come home—seven o'clock eight o'clock eight-thirty what could be more important than love i ca n't imagine you can not a good day not about to get better 4. the bird comes complete with heart liver and neck-bone wrapped chastely in white paper still half-frozen the legs are hard to separate inside wax paper sticks to the ribs i reach like a vet delivering pigs or a boy finger-fucking a virgin 5. air the same sweet temperature inside the house as outside the house stepping up from the cellar with an armful of sheets i listen for the dirge of flies under the chittering birds both painfully loud there is a stridency that 's stubborn in a life grown by inches the fat little fingers of buds bursting ugly ducklings the slow war of day against night as i pin the swelling sheets with clothespins damp and too narrow at the mouth i wonder how flies know to come out to feed the birds and feast themselves on the new stillborn this stubborn great chain of being
que será el café of this holy incorporated place the wild steam of scorched espresso cakes rising like mirages from the aromatic waste waving over the coffee-glossed lips of these faces assembled for a standing breakfast of nostalgia of tastes that swirl with the delicacy of memories in these forty-cent cups of brown sugar histories in the swirling froth of café-con-leche que será what have they seen that they can not forget— the broad-leaf waves of tabaco and plantains the clay dust of red and nameless mountains que será that this morning i too am a speck i am the brilliant guitar of a tropical morning speaking spanish and ribboning through potions of waist-high steam and green cane oceans que será drums vanishing and returning the african gods that rule a rhythmic land playing their music bongó bembé conga que será that cast the spells of this rumba this wild birthright this tropical dance with the palms of this exotic confusion que será that i too should be a question que será what have i seen what do i know— culture of café and loss this place i call home

the poem in which we drive an hour to the beach and uncle dave does n't get out of his lawn chair once the poem in which we left the yellow plastic shovel behind and everyone is bereft the poem in which i ca n't stop talking about how you walked deep into lake erie and the water was still only up to your knees when you turned into a speck past the rock jetty the poem in which everyone listens to celebrity gossip in the car on the way back the poem in which i pontificate on how ugly the fiancée of that jonas brother is and how they 're too young to get married and how my grandmother 's old neighbor would have said `` ugly she ca n't help that she 's ugly it 's that she's so stupid '' and i would have yelled at her for assuming that all former hair- dressers are dim the poem in which i turn into my grandmother 's old neighbor the poem in which i remember very clearly how they both stored tissues in their bras the poem in which i think about how this would horrify your mother—the pendulous breasts the moist tissues the dipping into the cleavage to retrieve anything the poem in which your mother tries not to wince when i order whatever i want from the menu despite her coupon for two medium 1-topping pizzas the poem in which i try to find a deeper meaning for why i notice the woman ahead of us in line at johnny 's liquor store who buys a pack of menthols and asks the guy behind the counter if he knows her good-for-nothing brother she has hair that looks like cats got at a skein of yarn and a tattoo above her ankle that 's dark and unspecified it 's far enough above her ankle that it 's nearly mid- calf—like her ankle and calf are two different countries and the tattoo got lost in the borderlands on the way to its actual destination the poem in which i am territory that is under dispute and no one will occupy it because of fear and uncertainty the poem in which i reach the conclusion that this feeling is inspired by your mother and the way she hums out-of-season carols while doing kitchen tasks though it 's not really about the humming but rather the time she asked me to light the hanukkah candles in the attic because it would be better if they were out of the way for the christmas party the poem in which you and i are in line waiting to buy a mixed six-pack of great lakes and i am staring at a stranger 's tattoo and thinking about the fact that i am not anne frank while the baby is in the car with your mother the poem in which i go into walmart and buy the baby an olive-green cap that looks suspiciously like fidel castro 's the poem in which i could eradicate the fact that i ever went into walmart and bought anything so the baby can one day start a revolution the poem in which we see a couple on the highway median in a stalled-out buick and do n't stop to help the poem in which the highway median looks like the spit of land between two enemy trenches and i feel a deep longing for my childhood the poem in which i remember for no apparent reason the tornado instructions taped to the sides of all the filing cabinets in one office i worked in that was on the top floor of a mostly abandoned mall in overland park kansas all that was left decorative fountains floor tiles mirrored ceilings nearly famous pizza the carcass of sears the poem in which we leave northeastern ohio the poem in which we return to northeastern ohio the poem in which it is night and we are lost in northeastern ohio and we keep passing amish buggies adorned with reflective tape the poem in which the moon is a vehicle for content and is far less than a perfect reflector of anything the poem in which we are all in some kind of limbo
i almost insist on the words as doors left swinging from the force no one saw a wrap around hotel with empty courtyard boarded up sprayed white hiding out nick is too kind two black and slowly moving marbles against flesh sara a model of containment brian is luminous all eyes twin fires beyond the pit that only crackles green brighter than the edges of the neon lining fairfax family books the films of robert blake we score a trim ocean blue windbreaker and dinosaurs of the land sea air i slipped away from the bench when they brought the car around my black hobo sack abandoned and thought a bomb i was seamlessly high on my air heels and driven away to where the camera could not follow 8-4-13
tossing off expletives into the sea of cab lights i lounge ever more than i work i wear my silk pants to the middle-of-america themed bar as if white-collar were this halloween's hottest new costume it sinks like a stone this attention to the lives of others i think i have evolved to respect my social obligations only complaining to the cell phone 's warm illicit glow i feel drunk on the whole leafy season when you hear me working ever to avoid work sentiment forbidden by custom industrialization forbidden by nothing down the block they have begun restoring the mid-century antique dresser men shuffling back and forth with gold polish and sand it 's insane that i care to ask towards its progress we repeat a process of hoping our bodies to the future though for now mine eats cucumbers in bed i had a dream about a crystal blue pool i felt stupid when i saw the ocean

for scott harris last summer ’ s fishing failures dangled from trees a rapala and jitterbug a stand of privet paid for half-ounce jigs with rubber skirts and jelly worms with wide-gap hooks on ten-pound test we tithed with overzealous casts at bass then off we ’ d go our stringers bare to find a yard to cut a truck to wash so we could fill the tackle box we shared again today is 12/12/12 the mayan end and i a country boy in brooklyn for the week will hail a cab for the first time and think of cows unnerved by fish we missed and shouts of “ shit ” that followed and dawns to dusks and always back with you my childhood friend our girls will never know that pond ’ s deep hole a baseball diamond now fills — the city leaders ’ bright idea — or how their fathers sitting in the bleachers on saturdays a couple decades later can almost feel the stinging nettle against their thighs the lunker largemouth sweeping the bed with her tail while plastic lizards jerk and drag across the third base line or how when we untrain our ears to baseballs cracking bats and bitchy parents called strikes and alike we hear the peepers sounding off in oaks on down the way our mothers ’ and fathers ’ voices calling us home not too far behind or ahead

these grapes of stone were being proffered friend — john berryman grapes rough-touched and round stone- carved to be squeezed into the fundaments of rock wine she imagines it would be cold not sought for its smoothness and likely full of grit if not refined with care the satyr laughs carelessly for one caught in stone the cracked edges of his mouth spill grit as he leers after the loss of his fundaments which fall along the smooth cold torso plane exhibiting immaculate coolness at this literal loss of face carefully she strokes his head as if smoothing the fetlocks handcrafted from stone her affection is unforced a fundamental attraction to those beautiful gritty things made lovely by decay their gritted teeth so much more interesting than the art gallery ’ s cold geometrics which appear fundamental but fail to consider the careless chaos spinning at the stone center of all smooth creations and those grapes their unsmooth surface mirrors the messy passion flushing the grit- dusted cheek the hideous mouth of crumbling stone what heat from the dionysian ’ s cold brittle fruit the obliteration of all care if she could only perform the fundamental act of eating she thinks about wilderness fun mental liberation dancing her soles smooth pleasure as pervasive as care is now her feet a frenzied blur on the gritty forest floor shaking and pummeling out the cold as she prances over starlit stones she does not care who sees her as she grips the stone grapes feels the smooth crumbling cold enter her hand fingers embracing a thing more fundamental than earth bone grit
for carolina ebeid we enrolled at barbizon knowing full well we ’ d never look like what was promised cue carol of the bells cue a demo on the casio and the security of two-way escalators setting the speed those early mornings in our mall school the store ’ s silver grills some mannequins left half-clothed we ’ d taunt them with our imagined summers in london paris rome we weren ’ t please and thank you walking with books on our heads no we were going to devastate greek shipping heirs at every port of call yet when our bus broke down and we trudged the shoulder of highways single file dodging cigarette butt and horn we shook off those mornings studied their defenseless indifference the blinding surface the quality of electric without being alive we knew that there in only hot pants the ideal form plastic most would take a bullet for while at 16 we were already trash-talking our prayers never went beyond the second floor light-years away from the last word that distant somewhere where a boat loses course the north star forsaking its name to another

one night from the other side of a motel wall made of nothing but sawdust and pink stuff i listened as a man cried to someone on the telephone that all he wanted to do before he died was to come home “ i want to come home ” that night a man cried until i was ankle-deep in sleep and then up to my neck wading like a swimmer or like a suicide through the waves of him crying and into the deep as icebergs cracked into halves as jellyfish like thoughts were passed secretly between people and the seaweed like the sinuous soft green hair of certain beauty queens washed up by the sea except that we were in utah and one of us was weeping while the other one was sleeping with nothing but a thin dry wall between us
there is nothing more innocent than the still-unformed creature i find beneath soil neither of us knowing what it will become in the abundance of the planet it makes a living only by remaining still in its niche one day it may struggle out of its tender pearl of blind skin with a wing or with vision leaving behind the transparent i cover it again keep laboring hands in earth myself a singular body watching things grow wondering how a cut blade of grass knows how to turn sharp again at the end this same growing must be myself not aware yet of what i will become in my own fullness inside this simple flesh
i have never been the most mechanically inclined of men wrenches screwdrivers or shovels have never made nice with me in the shipyard i worked alone in the dark deep in the bilges of frigates for two months i hooked a torch to an oxygen tank with a green line and pulled a red hose through bulkheads to gas the brass tool hissed like an ostrich when it fed on metal that day my flame cut permanent deck fittings the loops fell like bright oranges i ripened the rusty metal i knew that this was a job to baby-sit me a job they gave to bad burners beginners playing with their tools who pretended their brass torches were trumpets and that gulls in the bay were tables of distracted diners when my father was a boy his father loaded him and his siblings in the car and dropped them off downtown so my grandfather could get drunk and my grandmother could pretend he was n't drinking again when i was a boy i enjoyed watching my father dig with dirt between his palms he spun the shovel before he dug as i grew i tried to stay away from work even when he paid me i stayed away from him too i never understood how he could work around so much grass for him life was work for him everything was hard for me it was not hard he stalked my mother a long time after their divorce he never understood she was not sod to be laid or a sprinkler to be attached to a pvc pipe seven inches in the ground that pregnant at fifteen was too soon neither of us is the most mechanical of men yet we still pride ourselves on how we fashion our tools i wake up shivering and crying in an empty bed the afternoon light entering and leaving an empty bottle of wine near an emptier glass—or roll over and try and fail to remember a woman's name which never really gets old just uncouth to say so and feel fixed to feel fixed is to feel a mechanical spirit to feel love or at least to play at paste for an evening to make believe she will never leave me as life almost did when i cut the green hose and was lonely and shaking that day on the deck of the destroyer looking into the green water and wondered what would be written on my tomb `` killed by oxygen was this unmechanical man '' in that moment close to death i only wanted my own lungs i did n't regret returning home and sleeping on my father 's couch and that summer i returned to each of the women of my past and bedded them all trying to reheat our want i do n't regret that—drinking wine and making love or writing poems and making love of wanting to stay but nonetheless leaving i do n't regret returning with said and spivak with weil and augustine of telling my father '' all sins are an attempt to fill voids '' or rebuilding my grandfather's house with hopkins in my head as i ripped the tar and shingles off the old roof with a shovel and i am not mad for being the second favorite son esau turned inside out ca n't regret saying that summer i was in fact already a bigger and better man than my father because i understood more i did n't mind he favored my younger brother who knew less than him i favored my brother 's way of living of skating in the park and smoking weed while i studied and wondered for us all how ridiculous i was that summer for us all for not attempting to rebuild any of his love that summer at all

i grew up in a village built on coal and labor an outhouse on a dirt road by a water pump glared at the whitewashed fences of uniformed yards that gaped like broken teeth in the mouths of miners all summer we played cossacks and bandits shot our symbolic rifles and revolvers and when killed would crush a wild cherry in the breast pocket the spot where the heart stopped who started it the red spreading over white satin never to be washed away completely “ i killed you i killed you ” i screamed as he fell down men found him three years later in the abandoned mine after an explosion his clothes covered with coal dust and blood women howled like wolves “ it ’ s nothing he ’ ll get up ” i thought “ it ’ s just that stupid wild cherry on his shirt ”
i want to be a passenger in your car again and shut my eyes while you sit at the wheel awake and assured in your own private world seeing all the lines on the road ahead down a long stretch of empty highway without any other faces in sight i want to be a passenger in your car again and put my life back in your hands

the spell is a mouth ’ s perilous-o as they dark circle the boats in their most resplendent pliable armor the concept fish aligning with girl or love with death to bring down men at sea temptation confused into offering the mismatch of like plus unlike really likes straight to rock bottom no equation has ever been this badass it ’ s the men who will enter the spell so far into exhaustion as weather as waves the tide pulling toward if letting go then over the whale road in the company of the dolphin the only other animal i ’ m told who can do it solely for pleasure it you know what i mean the lower half aglitter the top half brainy as beautiful is sometimes murderous lovelies their plotting and resolve and why not get these guys good the lechers to see at all in the whirling to hear what anyone might in wind roar and faint whistle — don ’ t worry about girls shrewd as whimsy legend-tough to the core don ’ t but it ’ s their spell too isn ’ t it locked there aligned with singing dazzle razor-blackened green not that they miss what human is like or know any end to waters half born to from where they look up men in boats so sick of the journey men gone stupid with blue with vast with gazing over and away the whole time until same to same-old to now they ’ re mean after that small out there the expanse in here the expanse the men look down aching misalignment — gorgeous lure that hides its hook steely sweet to o my god little fool ’ s breath triumphant all the way under and am i not deserving
as a kid the only black woman in my life was my fourth-grade teacher— i remember her not because she was black but mostly because of her copper-colored bob that never changed as if a piece of bronze had been chiseled onto her head and neither i nor my classmates could prove it was a wig but we knew it was too perfect to be real then you came in- ­to my home—but not the way someone came in one afternoon while we were away grocery shopping leaving the side door wide open releasing my white-winged parakeet my mother ’ s jewelry and our television gone and for years i watched you go from analog into digital you were the modicum of motherhood i encountered daily while my mother stood on a production line mouthing prayers for prosperity and health in a room of air compressors you ’ re a super galactic hologram—scattered light reconstructed through the dark matter ever-shrinking pixels—shifting the cosmology of the world with gigs of gayle and revolutionary road trips and now will you quietly fade out into the space- time continuum where not even my imagination will find you your last broadcast like the final song of our beloved parakeet as it flew past the leafless trees toward the vast dome of heaven
for james welch the first harvest of wheat in flatlands along the milk startled me into thoughts of you and this place we both remember and also forget as home maybe it was the familiarity or maybe it was my own need to ask if you have ever regretted leaving what bends what gives and have you ever missed this wind —it has now grown warm with late summer but soon it will be as dangerous as the bobcat stalking calves and pets just south of the river men take out their dogs a case of beer and wait in their pickups for dawn for a chance with their rifles they don ’ t understand that she isn ’ t going to make any mistakes with winter my need for an answer grows more desperate and there are only four roads out one is the same cat hunters drive with mannish glory and return along gun still oil-shined and unshot another goes deeper into assiniboine territory this is the one i should talk myself into taking next i haven ’ t much traveled the third except to visit a hospital where after the first time my mother had refused chemotherapy and the last road you know as well as i do— past the coral-painted catholic church its doors long ago sealed shut to the mouth of mission canyon then south just a ways to where the rockies cut open and forgive there you and i are on the ascent after that the arrival is what matters most
finding myself in a mesmeric orientation before me appeared benjamin franklin who magnetized his french paramours at dinner parties as an amusing diversion from his most serious studies of electricity and the ethereal fire i like thinking about how he would have stood on tiptoe to kiss their buzzing lips and everyone would gasp and clap for the blue spark between them i believe in an honest and forthright manner a democracy of plain speech so i have to find a way to explain i don ’ t care to have sex anymore once i was a high school teacher and there was a boy who everyday came in late who only came to school at all to sell drugs out of his backpack upon which he laid his head like a pillow and closed his eyes while i pointed at a chart diagramming the anatomy of a sparrow the vice principal was watching and taking notes as i taught this class so i slid the bag from under his cheek as if not to wake him wrapped his fingers around a pen i was trying to be a gentle mother and also trying to show i was in control of an unstable situation the boy also trying to be in control of himself walked so slow to my desk and we stood to watch him push everything—binders piles of ungraded papers a beaker of red pens to the floor he was so calm how do you like it when i touch your things i do not like it i live in a house with many blue mason jars each containing a feather collection or starfish collection or vertebrae collection and also there is a fully articulated fetal alligator skeleton each window is pressed by the design of a sweet-gum branch all the little orange and red stars of its leaves you can ’ t see the perfect geometry this close just haphazard parabolas but beneath the foundation the roots mirror the branching i have a chart of this to pull down the view is flat and so quiet on the inside have i been forthright yet what i want to know is what happens if i decide to never have sex again or more precisely can i decide to not have sex again and still be kind and be a joy to others i should mention i am a wife i should mention i was told my sole purpose is to be joy to others the sidewalks outside are very full of people and when i look at them i feel hopeless benjamin franklin was so jolly with his kite and his key and his scandalous electricity he was so in love with women and drink and democracy before i was this way i was not a house i was just a jar and what i wanted was to be broken a cool trick you can do that i once showed a class is crank a wheel covered in felt against another felt wheel static bristles and sparks and makes your hair stand on end but hook it to a leyden jar and the electricity fills up in there invisible as air becomes a glass battery until you too much the thing then wow broken glass everywhere i remember wanting that do i have to always want that my house is blue and quiet i can hardly hear the squirrel in my sweet-gum tree dancing like a sunbeam to sing his riddles “ a house full a hole full but you can not gather a bowl full. ” the air of everywhere is wet with electric fluid you can ’ t even tell but pop whiz everywhere “ in this field ” ben says “ the soul has room enough to expand to display all of her extravagances. ” the sweet gum has 10,000 sticky spiky seed balls they start green but grow black and fall for want of a barren season they look like sea urchins i call them tree urchins and think it ’ s a funny joke i don ’ t tell it to anyone as i am tired of being told what is not such a secret i know is an extravagance and i like best how it ’ s an extravagance so small you must keep it in a jar with others of its kind for it to ever mean anything at all
ida and isidor straus sleep side by side eternally in an egyptian galley fronting their woodlawn mausoleum symbolically they lie their boat is small nor was her body recovered from the titanic and yet the image of the voyage holds why not embark a river runs behind me on the other side of this dark window a dream called night boat arranged us side by side in a black craft sailing the river of forgetfulness until the stars went out it was poetic license i didn ’ t dream that boat the boat was dream and we were passengers balanced on the slippery cusp of daylight unless you had already disembarked in some shadowy port leaving me to sail along alone

when the townspeople gave the teenaged buddha a glass of wine so delicious he grew to an unthinkable size and froze into a blue statue that shielded the town from a wave that broke upon his back and would have swept away the town if he ’ d not tasted the wine and afterward the people were overjoyed and said they would do good deeds like carpool their children to school more often and plant lettuce everywhere while the buddha melted into water and receded into the calm sane sea

remember just dad tied an old tire to a metal fence pole so we could practice pitching—o say can you hear the hollow sound when the baseball strikes rubber—the rattling when it strikes wire—or that perfect sound— speak english only— when we strike the pole through the center of—o say can you remember just little league—barrigada '' tigers '' —black and gold uniforms—red seams— my brother played for father duenas memorial high school '' friars '' —maroon and gold uniforms—to pledge allegiance— we collected american baseball cards and cheered for the `` bash brothers '' in `` oakland '' —near where brian moved for college blue skies—thecoliseum was an island—green and gold uniforms—white bases— we stand to sing the national anthem—o say can you see us —what follows your flag
my dad 's going to give me a self back i 've made an altar called the altar for healing the father child asked him what i could do for him so he would do nice for me he said i should stop saying bad things about him since i 've said just about everything bad i can think of since well no i change my mind i ca n't promise him that but even healing is negotiable so if he 's in heaven or trying to get in it would n't hurt to be in touch the first thing i want is to be able to enjoy the little things again—for example to stop peeling down the list of things i have to do enjoy this poem enjoy how last night scouring the cupboards i found a can of sardines that must be five years old since i was home after a long trip since it was 1 a.m. i had n't eaten dinner since there was no other protein in the house i cranked it open remembered that my dad loved sardines—right before bed—with onions mustard i ca n't get into my dad 's old heart but i remember that look on his face when he would load mustard on a saltine cracker lay a little fish on top tip it with a juicy slice of onion then he 'd look up from his soiled fingers with one eyebrow raised a rakish grin that said—all for me —as if he was getting away with murder
nous n'irons plus au bois no more walks in the wood the trees have all been cut down and where once they stood not even a wagon rut appears along the path low brush is taking over no more walks in the wood this is the aftermath of afternoons in the clover fields where we once made love then wandered home together where the trees arched above where we made our own weather when branches were the sky now they are gone for good and you for ill and i am only a passer-by we and the trees and the way back from the fields of play lasted as long as we could no more walks in the wood
and the black water under the boats with their pools of bilge rainbowed out like rinds of steak fat the salt thick in my nostrils but pleasant too details i still remember from bishop ’ s poem everything else about it lost at the docks i watched my friend slip in her rubber boots the wide wet planks glossy with mosses you must walk duckfooted to get to the boats the black and orange fishing barrels the air with its tang of rusted metals there are always hooks and anchors to be found nets and scrapings of wood planed by chisel the way my great-grandmother was said to have worked employed as a shipwright on the city ’ s waterways in the ’ 30s according to the newspaper clipping my grandmother photocopies for me each christmas the description of her gunmetal hair and slim torso clad in overalls the hands she held out for the times reporter “ callused ” he noted “ strong as a man ’ s ” does not recall the woman i remember for her farm in bothell before it became a seattle suburb helping me gather raspberries from the long canes she planted by her porch we spent an afternoon together sweating in the same long-sleeved checkered shirts she ’ d sewn us according to the photo i no longer have and can not remember whether is the source or confirmation of this memory only the papery gray-green streaks of road dust on the canes a bowl of chipped porcelain inside of which were raspberries very red very sweet furred like my friend ’ s upper lip i remember between my teeth as we stood on the docks the smell of iron and winter mist her mouth like nothing i have tasted since
this film like many others claims we ’ ll enjoy life now that we ’ ve come through difficulties dangers so incredibly condensed that they must be over if the hardship was undergone by others we identified with them and if the danger was survived by simpler life forms they ’ re included in this moment when the credits roll and we don ’ t know when to stand
they found you under twenty feet of loose ash — one vowel solo in an archipelago of strung-out vowels and doting volcanoes — isole eolie — o hoop of exhilaration o sigh of relief softening your votive mouth if not blowing off steam at the crater rim crystalizing sulfur poring over tomes the trade winds and furies that fan through your realm o citizen-king o sonorous persona weaned on fumes and that old itinerant intonation — air your woes all over again

you can do the work just by starting it you can do whatever you want a bill is drafted on a train to albany or in a black limousine like how one day i walked the entire length of manhattan except i didn ’ t i didn ’ t finish not nearly how could i stopped as i was by the boat basin these credit cards fill with gin and tonic they pool with the stuff maybe i get a little lost sometimes start thinking i went to yale once i swam to governors island between the ferries and freighters it was like a job you should ’ ve seen me quit maybe they looked for me maybe it wasn ’ t someone else ’ s shift and then it was sometimes people are just turnstiles you have to tell them to keep turning keep turning into someone else the rain crashes across a cab and the road has filled we ’ re waterborne or whatever the word is for that little moment when the heart lifts why don ’ t you devote yourself the way you once did it ’ s an old answer and an early one the alarm goes off for a while after it stops in your face in the bathroom mirror you play that little song to look at your teeth my teeth they haven ’ t been cared for the class giggles at my age this is my hearing the chances taken on a new face
if one saves a butterfly has one saved the world rabbi says if one saves one butterfly even with long wings one butterfly that has fallen into water it may be said “ he has saved the whole world. ” if one saves a motley moth is it the same rabbi it is valid if one saves a dirty monkey from a flame for example it is as the saying is he or she has saved the whole world it is valid for all creatures and not more so for the creatures who know how to recite the blessings it is always valid even on the sabbath it is said the creatures of the sky are owned by no one like the land if one saves the book from being destroyed is it also saving a world rabbi god forbid yes saving the book from the fire saving the book or books from the fire is known to be comparable he who saves a book and he who writes a holy book it should be said they have saved the whole world like a book if one saves a rose one rose from the garden of your dead teacher is it still appropriate to think she has saved the world the rabbi was silent and seemed troubled he replied if the house of the great teacher is in ruins and the garden is a scandal and one saves one rose from his garden it is said even of one rose it is like saving the world it is also said the rose will grow as large as the world

slowing down your body enough to feel thought you were at a standstill but you were only slowing down enough to feel the pain there are worse things than running to catch the train twisting your ankle the afternoon fucked running to get to or away from the stranger who helps you up wants to know you who are so used to anything scribbled on a prescription blank just want the pain to go away you say surprised to find yourself reaching for someone else 's hand
between the train 's long slide and the sun ricocheting off the sea anyone would have fallen silent in those words the language of age in her face the birds cawing over the broken earth gathering near its stones and chapel doors in the marina the sea and its bones have grown smaller though the tide is out it is not the tide nor the feathers nor the cat that jumps into the street the dust lifting with each wing and disappearing the rust- colored sheets that wrap the sails of ships i do n't know their name nor the way to say lips of water in italian and mean this an old woman stood by the tracks until his hand stopped waving
for cosetta once there were coyotes cardinals in the cedar you could cure amnesia with the trees of our back-forty once i drowned in a monsoon of frogs— grandma said it was a good thing a promise for a good crop grandma ’ s perfect tomatoes squash she taught us to shuck corn laughing never spoke about her childhood or the faces in gingerbread tins stacked in the closet she was covered in a quilt the creek way but i don ’ t know this kind of burial vanishing toads thinning pecan groves peach trees choked by palms new neighbors tossing clipped grass over our fence line griping to the city of our overgrown fields grandma fell in love with a truck driver grew watermelons by the pond on our indian allotment took us fishing for dragonflies when the bulldozers came with their documents from the city and a truckload of pipelines her shotgun was already loaded under the bent chestnut the well where cosetta ’ s husband hid his whiskey—buried beneath roots her bundle of beads they tell the story of our family cosetta ’ s land flattened to a parking lot grandma potted a cedar sapling i could take on the road for luck she used the bark for heart lesions doctors couldn ’ t explain to her they were maps traces of home the milky way where she ’ s going she said after the funeral i stowed her jewelry in the ground promised to return when the rivers rose on the grassy plain behind the house one buffalo remains along the highway ’ s gravel pits sunflowers stand in dense rows telephone poles crook into the layered sky a crow ’ s beak broken by a windmill ’ s blade it is then i understand my grandmother when they see open land they only know to take it i understand how to walk among hay bales looking for turtle shells how to sing over the groan of the county road widening to four lanes i understand how to keep from looking up small planes trail overhead as i kneel in the johnson grass combing away footprints up here parallel to the median with a vista of mesas ’ weavings the sky a belt of blue and white beadwork i see our hundred and sixty acres stamped on god ’ s forsaken country a roof blown off a shed beams bent like matchsticks a drove of white cows making their home in a derailed train car
a basket of apples brown in our kitchen their warm scent is the scent of ripening and my sister entering the room quietly takes a seat at the table takes up the task of peeling slowly away the blemished skins even half-rotten ones are salvaged carefully she makes sure to carve out the mealy flesh for this i am grateful i explain this elegy would love to save everything she smiles at me and before long the empty bowl she uses fills domed with thin slices she brushes into the mouth of a steaming pot on the stove what can i do i ask finally nothing she says let me finish this one thing alone
for rick hill and in memory of buster mitchell i steel arches up past the customs sheds the bridge to a place named canada thrust into mohawk land a dull rainbow arcing over the new school designed to fan out like the tail of the drumming partridge— dark feathers of the old way 's pride mixed in with blessed kateri's pale dreams of sacred water ii when that first span fell in 1907 cantilevered shapes collapsed gave like an old man's arthritic back the tide was out the injured lay trapped like game in a deadfall all through that day until the evening then as tide came in the priest crawled through the wreckage giving last rites to the drowning iii loading on the cable lifts girders swing and sing in sun tacked to the sky reflecting wind long knife-blade mirrors they fall like jackstraws when they hit the top of the big boom 's run the cable looped the buzzer man pushes a button red as sunset the mosquito whine of the motor whirrs bare bones up to the men who stand an edge defined on either side by a long way down iv those who hold papers claim to have ownership of buildings and land they do not see the hands which placed each rivet they do not hear the feet walking each hidden beam they do not hear the whisper of strong clan names they do not see the faces of men who remain unseen as those girders which strengthen and shape
i want to reach you— in that city where the snow only shimmers silver for a few hours it has taken seventeen years this trip these characters patterned in black ink curves catching on the page like hinges this weave of letters fraying like the lines on my palm all broken paths outside no snow just the slow pull of brown on the hills umber dulling to a bruise until the city is just a memory of stained teeth the burn of white marble to dusk cows standing on the edges like a dust cloud gaining weight after days of no rain asleep in the hot berth my parents sway in a dance the silence broken by scrape of tin hiss of tea and underneath the constant clatter of wheels beating steel tracks over and over to the city of white marble to the city of goats tobacco fields city of dead hands a mantra of my grandmother's— her teeth eaten away by betel leaves—the story of how shah jahan had cut off all the workers hands after they built the taj so they could never build again i dreamt of those hands for weeks before the trip weeks even before i stepped off the plane thousands of useless dead flowers drying to sienna silent in their fall every night days before i dreamt those hands climbing over the iron gate of my grandparents house over grate and spikes some caught in the groove between its sharpened teeth others biting where they pinched my skin
because my father said yes but not in our lifetimes because my mother said i know my daughter would never want to marry ... but mostly because they rarely spoke of or noticed or even whispered about and did not of course ... because magazines rarely tv rarely textbooks rarely or not at all except for figures like george washington carver who 'd lived in our state because among the crayons there was one called flesh because paintings rarely or never until because books from the library never until because college literature not at all the american lit anthology had only gwendolyn brooks who was not assigned because a few years after brown v. board of education i wrote a paper that took the position yes but not yet

for my father i think by now the river must be thick with salmon late august i imagine it as it was that morning drizzle needling the surface mist at the banks like a net settling around us — everything damp and shining that morning awkward and heavy in our hip waders we stalked into the current and found our places — you upstream a few yards and out far deeper you must remember how the river seeped in over your boots and you grew heavier with that defeat all day i kept turning to watch you how first you mimed our guide 's casting then cast your invisible line slicing the sky between us and later rod in hand how you tried — again and again — to find that perfect arc flight of an insect skimming the river 's surface perhaps you recall i cast my line and reeled in two small trout we could not keep because i had to release them i confess i thought about the past — working the hooks loose the fish writhing in my hands each one slipping away before i could let go i can tell you now that i tried to take it all in record it for an elegy i 'd write — one day — when the time came your daughter i was that ruthless what does it matter if i tell you i learned to be you kept casting your line and when it did not come back empty it was tangled with mine some nights dreaming i step again into the small boat that carried us out and watch the bank receding — my back to where i know we are headed
in breughel 's great picture “ canal street ” restaurant customers order roast swan instead of chicken hurled salad instead of tossed salad while shoppers spill through a maze of stalled trucks and scurry around the sidewalk stalls jammed with countless nameless things that housewives sidestep to surround a japanese man in a broad-brim hat and painted silk tie as he demonstrates how one gadget can cut food 50 different ways and though they do n't understand a word he says they stand transfixed by his spiel amid the fumes and noise and loud fruitvendors dropping casual perfections of sun and rain into bags and sacks against a backdrop of silver towers and sea and fields vibrant with excess that giddy farmers hail by tossing animals large animals into the air to be carried away on the winds of exuberance to the four corners of the globe where the romping gods bear so many attributes they 're a bundle of incongruities and no one takes them seriously not even their beaming angels who parachute drunkenly down to the shore distracting the dogs let loose on cormorants that ate so much they ca n't fly but not the boys in the rowboat who have caught a blowfish tickled its belly until it 's about to burst like a balloon before dropping it overboard to watch it blow itself backward to kingdom come nor the other children who have stopped clamoring over the stranded whale 's back to swim out underwater under the swans grab them by the legs and yank them down in a slow fury of bubbles and light and then sell them to the market near the restaurant in the foreground of breughel 's great picture “ canal street ”

i don ’ t know how fast i was going but even so that ’ s still an intriguing question officer and deserves a thoughtful response with the radio unfurling beethoven ’ s ode to joy you might consider anything under 80 sacrilege particularly on a parkway as lovely as the one you ’ re fortunate enough to patrol—and patrol so diligently a loveliness that if observed at an appropriate rate of speed affords the kind of pleasure which is in itself a reminder of how civilization depends on an assurance of order and measure and the devotion of someone like yourself to help maintain it yes man the measurer the incorrigible measurer and admirably precise measurements they are—not of course as an end in themselves but lest we forget as a means to propel us into the immeasurable where it would be anybody ’ s guess how fast the west wind was blowing when it strummed a rainbow and gave birth to eros never forget that a parkway is a work of art and the faster one goes the greater the tribute to its power of inspiration a lyrical propulsion that approaches the spiritual and tempts—demands the more intrepid of us to take it from there that sense of the illimitable when we feel we are more the glory than the jest or riddle of the world —that ’ s what kicked in albeit briefly as i approached the croton reservoir bridge and on a night like this starlight reignited above a snowfall ’ s last flurry cockeyed headlights scanning the girders overhead eggshell snowcrust flying off the hood hatching me on the wing like a song breaking through prose the kind i usually sing through my nose so much to love a bit less to scorn what have i done to what end was i born to teach and delight delight … or offend luck ’ s been no lady truth a sneaky friend got the heater on full blast window jammed down odometer busted speedometer dead wrong can ’ t tell how fast i ’ m going don ’ t care how far i ’ ve gone
my objectives this morning were vague as always i 'd hike these hills— a way to keep going against the odds age deals a way to keep body and soul together and not so much thinking as letting things steal into mind— but i started counting from the very first step i took i wore rank old boots ill-laced and patchwork pants around my neck hung the frayed lanyard of a whistle i use to summon our trio of dogs who capered and yelped their pleasure at one of our walks and more miraculous still at having me for a master it 's true in a sense that i always count as i wander though it 's usually the beats of a tune thelonious 's `` blue monk '' a favorite that mark my time these counts felt odder better we scattered a brood of grouse at step 91. the deerflies strafed us at 500 a late trillium glowed by a ledge like a lotus right along the rain kept pounding i was mindful of all these things but i never stopped counting life was good and more it was worthy of better response at 1000 i thought enough—and counted on nothing was coming to mind nothing is coming again from my hike half the day ago with three dogs through rain but a mystic sense of well-being in quietly chanted numbers whatever this trance i treasured it as a wonder not to be wrenched into meaning as in every second counts as in you should count your blessings though of those there seems no doubt
i use a trick to teach students how to avoid passive voice circle the verbs imagine inserting “ by zombies ” after each one have the words been claimed by the flesh-hungry undead if so passive voice i wonder if these sixth graders will recollect on summer vacation as they stretch their legs on the way home from yellowstone or yosemite and the byway ’ s historical marker beckons them to the site of an indian village— where trouble was brewing where after further hostilities the army was directed to enter where the village was razed after the skirmish occurred where most were women and children riveted bramble of passive verbs etched in wood— stripped hands breaking up from the dry ground to pinch the meat of their young red tongues

please think of this as not merely a piece of writing that anyone would fully appreciate but as plain and simple words that attempt to arouse whatever appetencies you especially depend upon language to fulfill that drench you in several levels of meaning at once rendering my presence superfluous in other words welcome this as a poem not merely a missive i ’ ve slowly composed and tucked under your windshield wiper so that these onlookers who saw me bash in your fender will think i ’ m jotting down the usual information and go away
i hardly know where to look anymore places have a putrid familiarity like the smell of my own sheets or the close air of the kitchen — fishbones on the drain left in the ghastly order of temporal things i have been sitting in this bar for years now the beer is stale the wine off-color the music is always the same old sad songs that get older no better than endless conversation night after forgotten night when all i or you can recall is the dark the traffic lights the bartender 's comments about drunk women in public places i would like to go home finally down the long streets north and south crossed with small gold leaves i forget just where the hell anything is locked out
from this height the sunset spans the whole world before me houses and trees are shadows neon flares between them like sudden fire the freeways run always strangely vacant with riderless cars empty air the windows up here refract the blue slate and rose light making the hills on the horizon collide with ideas of sussex piedmont or the cold clear wind of the abruzzi but that is never what is out there at home the lamp curls its aurora into the corners of the room and out the windows squares rectangles of light stake out a territory on the ragged lawn in the center of things between the pressing of the window and air — a small space — there is a meeting that defines nothing everything
cold cry from the last page of the dictionary name with a knife in it and the knife italic against the throat till you fall into so heavy a sleep — sleep made of asterisks and cattle the herd just a black scarf against snow — you can ’ t begin to guess where the old world went now there are only two choices says the tale and neither is good hence an axe above each separate entrance as the hero becomes hardly a voice and the sad dogs appear on the screen then there is a thin high scraping then no noise of any sort at all

some quests begin before a person ever learns to walk q ’ s began at the foundling home when he was still in diapers they ’ d kept anything pointed from the quonset hut where they housed the orphaned newbies and later the house mothers forbade the children all but scissors with round edges even table knives “ mind now stay in the queue ” they said when his fingers reached for a safety pin or a paring knife or once one of the razors they kept usually under lock and key for the older boys q slipped back in line only the blunt was available to him nothing to question naught with an edge best pretend to be dull though that was hard with a high iq and never query why hide the scissors why hide the razor why speak so sharply why no mums no dads at night in his bed listening to the breathing of all the other boys in the long room he also asked himself why me when the house mothers changed shifts there were always some unsupervised minutes and that ’ s when the boys sprang into swashbuckling q loved leaping from bed to bed with an imaginary sword in hand en garde • at sixteen with a razor cut on his chin from the new trial of shaving himself q stood at the doors of the royal flower hall he was quaking this was the very first day of work in his life he ’ d been supposed to be a shop assistant a quotidian job like those of the other orphans who were all sent out to live as apprentices — to return only if found unsuitable however the royal flower keeper had stepped in and demanded to know the name of the boy meant to be sent to the local florist and now young q was called to prep flowers for the queen “ can ’ t someone else do it ” he quailed as the flower keeper handed him a quilloned silver thorn knife q didn ’ t want to be found unsuitable he quivered as thousands of roses arrived — he was supposed to separate their long tangled stems cut off the thorns and queue them up straight on the tables for the arrangers “ but i ’ m new ” q cried he couldn ’ t quell his horror at the prospect of lifting a real blade to cut the thorns “ look dear no quibbling if you work here you ’ re qualified ” the flower keeper said her knuckles bloomed out of the crooked stems of her hands “ hold the knife with two fingers behind this little crossbar that ’ s the quillon and snip under the thorn. ” she did it with elegant speed one thorn gone “ it ’ s like swordsmanship ” the flower keeper joked wielding her knife fencing in miniature mime in q ’ s head rang the orders of the house mothers “ don ’ t touch ” but in his fingers lay his imaginary weapon come alive “ no time to be quiescent ” she said “ equipoise is all. ” don ’ t quit now q said to himself if he quit he ’ d have to slink back to the orphanage a failed apprentice instead of going home to his newly found haven a cold-water flat with a coin-operated heater all his own there he ’ d store the new paring knife his paycheck would buy the pointed scissors ... so q quashed his fear and set to work • he began to duel through the roses “ en garde ” he whispered lunging toward his petaled quarry soon there were thorns everywhere some a bit bloody but he did not make any big mistakes he wasn ’ t perfect like the flower keeper but he was catching on like quicksilver she flashed her knife each stem quickening with the sharpest cut instinctively q used the quartata maneuver a quarter turn to the inside protecting himself as he flicked each thorn into the quagmire of floral detritus on the floor with each toss of the thorn he added to what appeared to the flower keeper to be his nascent gift as the lorries loaded with rose baskets and vases and bowls roared off to the palace he quietly pocketed a thorn then the first question he ’ d ever spoken aloud curlicued to his lips and because he ’ d had to save up this query for sixteen years he posed the essential one previously mouthed only to himself at night in bed pourquoi “ why ” said the flower keeper “ for the equerry of course and he for the queen you know who she is. ” “ just a flower of a figurehead ” q quipped the boy ’ s quick-witted the flower keeper thought and said “ we ’ ll require you tomorrow. ” and for quadruple tomorrows after that and after that until q began to accumulate expertise know-how defines a person especially someone who ’ s grown up watching his ps and qs he no longer quavered quadrillions of roses now quasi-ordinary royal waste a quiddity i ’ m not a quitter he ’ d said to himself and each night went back to his cold-water flat where he had enshrined that little thorn in a matchbox • well he didn ’ t live in a cold-water flat now now he lived in a sunlit house with a stash of razors in the marble bathroom and in the drawers of his magnificent kitchen a motherlode of paring knives bread knives steak knives bird ’ s beak parers boning knives cheese knives chef ’ s clam and carving knives filleters and mincers now q was senior keeper of the royal flower hall walking across a stage toward the queen herself he had kept the talisman thorn from his very first day with the roses just that afternoon he had taken it out and dropped it in the pocket of his tuxedo anticipating touching it for luck before he received his award from her majesty but when the queen posed her standard question “ have you come a long way ” q was quite bewildered as to how to answer sometimes a simple question cuts into an aromatic world of mysteries but we must learn to answer to cut q his distinguished silver hair perfectly trimmed his neck properly shaved looked down at the curls on the queen ’ s forehead and remembered his first unspoken word why a quixotic word an essential thorn it had pricked him awake into manhood arrangements of roses passed through his mind — how those magnificats of magentas quenched his imagination how the choral crooning of pale pinks calmed his qualms among roses he had reached his quintessence yet is it a large enough life to arrange roses for a queen when the whole world out there hurtled toward famine and war he hadn ’ t intended to stay to make a future in flowers taking people ’ s breath away with something so spectacularly unnecessary as his rose floats he had been a thorn in someone ’ s side spectacularly unnecessary himself he ’ d been sent out into the world alone blunted by the unknown facts of his identity — his search for his parents rewarded only by locked doors locked cabinets and later graveyards patiently her majesty waited for his answer in physical distance he had come a short way but he ’ d swashbuckled miles to reach the end of his quest “ only from kew gardens your highness ” q answered simply at last then she put into his palm the royal thank-you in a quilted sleeve a silver rose wreath made from an ancient mold that gave it stylized petals prickly leaves and cut in at the bottom of the circle a thorn “ q from alphabetique ” 2013 by kara kosaka
how can you go swimming in another human being i am swimming and asking for light once i paddled into dust and fucking and the horsemen and ruin and the poisonous hollows of a projected blue eye and cracked my skull on all and caught more disease in my already dread mind and entered the medicines of no human power the forests of disappearing moans which were rich in sap but lacked dissolve fertilized against my own swimming nature aleph i am swimming for you now and i don ’ t care when you leave the forest you do not become the ocean and i have become the desert trying to swim in the ocean and knowing this carrying the forest floor in a sweet wood coffin and the blackbrush and rocks the yucca and cacti of receded oceans which were never oceans at all or there would have been shells on the sand they only looked like oceans in my thirst i cut the old horizon with a sword you have given and i gut the heavens and bleed their light and swim in that

the people i love the best jump into work head first without dallying in the shallows and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight they seem to become natives of that element the black sleek heads of seals bouncing like half-submerged balls i love people who harness themselves an ox to a heavy cart who pull like water buffalo with massive patience who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward who do what has to be done again and again i want to be with people who submerge in the task who go into the fields to harvest and work in a row and pass the bags along who are not parlor generals and field deserters but move in a common rhythm when the food must come in or the fire be put out the work of the world is common as mud botched it smears the hands crumbles to dust but the thing worth doing well done has a shape that satisfies clean and evident greek amphoras for wine or oil hopi vases that held corn are put in museums but you know they were made to be used the pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real

everything that was young went quickly the way his eyes met mine as soon as we woke together in a room outside nanjing feeling as if all the things that were falling would fall and make their thunder leave us with the challenge of being happy all the things that felt given when gifts were not just surprises but what we knew what we hoped to take with us to heaven unbound by faults and sins not deceived the way we were when the end came to what we knew of china landing me here i am a wish in the skies spun out from celestial space to be poor to be covered with black skin a felt quilt of a map with only one way to china — through pain as big as hogs squealing at killing time on black farms in alabama — the noise of death the shrill needle that turns clouds over to rip the air above the cities where people are young and all that is given is never taken away

the black water lights dotting the entire perimeter their shaky reflections the dark tree line the plap-plapping of water around the pier creaking boats the creaking pier voices in conversation in discussion—two men adults—serious inflections the words themselves just out of reach a rusty screen-door spring then the door swinging shut footsteps on a porch the scrape of a wooden chair footsteps shuffling through sand animated youthful voices how many — distinct disappearing a sudden guffaw some giggles a woman ’ s—no a young girl ’ s—sarcastic reply someone ’ s assertion a high-pitched male cackle somewhere else a child laughing bug-zappers tires whirring along a pavement ... not stopping ... receding shadows from passing headlights a cat ’ s eyes caught in a headlight no moon connect-the-dot constellations filling the black sky—the ladle of the big dipper not quite directly overhead the radio tower across the lake signaling muffled quacking near the shore a frog belching crickets cicadas katydids etc.—their relentless sexual messages a sudden gust of wind branches brushing against each other—pine beech a fiberglass hull tapping against the dock a sudden chill the smell of smoke woodstove fires a light going out a dog barking then more barking from another part of the lake a burst of quiet laughter someone in the distance calling someone too loud steps on a creaking porch a screen-door spring the door banging shut another light going out you must have just undressed for bed my bare feet on the splintery pier turning away from the water
they got old they got old and died but first— okay but first they composed plangent depictions of how much they lost and how much cared about losing meantime their hair got thin and more thin as their shoulders went slumpy okay but not before the photo albums got arranged by them arranged with a niftiness not just two or three but eighteen photo albums yes eighteen eventually eighteen albums proving the beauty of them and not someone else them and their relations and friends incontrovertible playing croquet in that bloomington yard floating on those comic inflatables at dow lake giggling at the dairy queen waltzing at the wedding building a lego palace on the porch holding the baby beside the rental truck leaning on the hemingway statue at pamplona discussing the eternity of art in that sardinian restaurant yes and so quite frankly—at the end of the day— they got old and died okay sure but quite frankly how much does that matter in view of the eighteen photo albums big ones thirteen inches by twelve inches each full of such undeniable beauty
once my sister told me that from her summit at the city pool she could see the yellow billows spread like gas or dreams between kids ’ legs in something the size of the sea you can ’ t be sure who ’ s watching from above let ’ s say it ’ s the almighty twirling his whistle ready to blow it at any moment and let loose the bottomless apocalypse the ocean would make bone of a body coral of bone piss and a tiger-fish darts through a skull-hole a weed weaves itself through ribs you too have seen the bulbs flash from the sea you too have felt it breathing down your neck you eat fish you ’ ve heard that mermaids sing my dreams are as beleaguered as the next joe ’ s my happiness as absurd but i ’ m not going to go piss in the ocean about it no not in the ocean
in the huddle you said “ go long—get open ” and at the snap i took off along the right sideline and then cut across left in a long arc and i ’ m sure i was open at several points— glancing back i saw you pump-fake more than once but you must not have been satisfied with what you saw downfield and then i got bumped off course and my hands touched the turf but i regained my balance and dashed back to the right i think or maybe first left and then right and i definitely got open but the throw never came— maybe you thought i couldn ’ t hang on to a ball flung so far or maybe you actually can ’ t throw so far but in any case i feel quite open now the defenders don ’ t seem too interested in me i sense only open air all around me though the air is getting darker and it would appear by now we ’ re well into the fourth quarter and i strongly doubt we can afford to settle for dinky little first downs if the score is what i think it is so come on star boy fling a hail mary with a dream-coached combination of muscle and faith and i will gauge the arc and i will not be stupidly frantic and i will time my jump and—i ’ m just going to say in the cool gloaming of this weirdly long game it is not impossible that i will make the catch
the kitchen in the house had a nook for eating a groove for the broom behind the door and the woman moved through it like bathing reaching ladles from drawers turning to lift the milk from the refrigerator while still stirring the pudding as if the room and everything in it were as intimate to her as her body as beautiful and worthy of her attention as the elbows which each day she soothed with rose lotion or the white legs she lifted again and again in turn while watching television to be in that room must be what it was like to be the man next to her at night or the child who at six o ’ clock had stood close enough to smell the wool of her sweater through the steam and later at the goodnight kiss could breathe the flavor of her hair— codfish and broccoli—and taste the coffee which was darkness on her lips and listen then from upstairs to the water running down the mattress drifting down the river a pale moonmark on the floor and hear the clink of silverware—the stars their distant speaking—and picture the ceiling—the back of a woman kneeling covering the heart and holding up the bed and roof and cooling sky

i walking across the pch we looked up and saw big as the butt of a pen jupiter fat with light and unheighted i looked back at the waiting traffic stalled at the seaside road ’ s salt-rimmed traffic lights as they swayed to the pacific ’ s not-quite- anapestic song of sea and air — the raw and sudden crick of crickets — the cars suddenly silent as cows — and blue malibu blackening like a bee ii a poem is a view of the pacific and the pacific and the pacific taking in its view of the pacific and the pacific as the pacific just like that as though there ’ s no pacific ends a poem is the palm of the ocean closing it or she or he is merely which means it or she or he is a mar but a mar made up of temperament and tempo — the red weather in the heart iii i ’ m about to get this all wrong i know santa monica behind me the ocean to my left jupiter high above me and malibu somewhere in my mind flecked with mist and dusk and dylan and strange grays in the sunsets that stripe the seaside hills like the tricolor of a country made of beauty the dream of beauty and smog sadly in my mind it ’ s always snowing which is beautiful but austere unlike here iv along the thin pedestrian passage beside the pch just off sunset mel gibson chants of beginnings and ends and lies and facts — jews and blacks being both the lies and facts his face is ruddy like bruschetta he storms at the police because fuck them he ’ s wearing his t-shirt like a toga he schools them his toga wisdom from toga times he offers them his toga they offer him a ride — v arun ’ s car carried us like metaphor in a poem or painting moving meaning moving the current being the current the terse tug of tides still the great glamour still even as we speed on the 110 the music in my head the jupiter of the mind ’ s unstemmed pacific ocean as it unfurls in the vapor trail of malibu fragrant in far-off fluorescents like a nocturnal flower calling you vi then downtown la and la live surged up like marginalia on a newly turned page spangled with bland suggestions fiery accusations of its own brilliance that descend into indifference we speed nearer and it grows we veer and it grows we park and it grows close your eyes now look and it has grown yo la quiero but i should know better if just because you can smell the injustice in the air vii the pacific encircles me slowly as though it doesn ’ t trust me or better said i only understand it this way by feeling like a stranger at its blue door the poet with the sea stuck in his enjambments can ’ t call out to some cathay as though some cathay exists and be glad no the differences we have should be felt and made through that feeling an eclipsed lack a power to take in what you can ’ t take back viii the old hocus of this ocean ’ s focus on pulling its waves over the soft surf like a skin pulled down tight over the top of a drum was to her a new hocus we stared out with her out toward hokusai ’ s tiny boats and rising lace-fringed sea swells no chunk of haiku could think to charter it was like the eighth day of creation in the eighth line of a poem — she sang she didn ’ t sing the sea sang then stopped

i. o the screech and heat and hate we have for each day 's commute the long wait at the last stop before we go screaming underground while the pigeons court and shit and rut insolently on the tracks because this train is always late always aimed at only us who when it comes with its blunt snout its thousand mouths cram and curse and contort into one creature all claws and eyes tunneling tunneling tunneling toward money 2. sometimes a beauty cools through the doors at grand glides all the untouchable angles and planes of herself to stand among us like a little skyscraper so sheer so spare gazes going all over her in a craving wincing way like sun on glass 3. there is a dreamer all good conductors know to look for when the last stop is made and the train is ticking cool some lover loner or fool who has lived so hard he jerks awake in the graveyard where he sees coming down the aisle a beam of light whose end he is and what he thinks are chains becoming keys
brachest she called it gentling grease over blanching yolks with an expertise honed from three decades of dawns at the longhorn diner in loraine where even the oldest in the old men 's booth swore as if it were scripture truth they 'd never had a breakfast better rapping a glass sharply to get her attention when it went sorrowing so far into some simple thing— the jangly door or a crusted pan the wall clock 's black hitchy hands— that she would startle blink then grin as if discovering them all again who remembers now when one died the space that he had occupied went unfilled for a day then two three until she unceremoniously plunked plates down in the wrong places and stared their wronged faces back to banter she could hardly follow unmarried childless homely `` slow '' she knew coffee cut with chamomile kept the grocer paul 's ulcer cool yarrow in gravy eased the islands of lesions in larry borwick 's hands and when some nightlong nameless urgency sent him seeking human company brother tom needed hash browns with cheese she knew to nod at the litany of cities the big-rig long-haulers bragged her past to laugh when the hunters asked if she 'd pray for them or for the quail they went laughing off to kill and then—envisioning one rising so fast it seemed the sun tugged at it—to do exactly that who remembers where they all sat crook-backed builders drought-faced farmers vf'ers muttering through their wars night-shift roughnecks so caked in black it seemed they made their way back every morning from the dead who remembers one word they said the longhorn diner 's long torn down the gin and feedlots gone the town itself now nothing but a name at which some bored boy has taken aim every letter light-pierced and partial sister aunt sissy bera thrailkill i picture you one dime-bright dawn grown even brighter now for being gone bustling amid the formica and chrome of that small house we both called home during the spring that was your last all stories stop once more you 're lost in something i can merely see steam spiriting out of black coffee the scorched pores of toast a bowl of apple butter like edible soil bald cloth knifelight the lip of a glass my plate 's gleaming teeming emptiness
at home in my flannel gown like a bear to its floe i clambered to bed up the globe 's impossible sides i sailed all night—till at last with my black beard my furs and my dogs i stood at the northern pole there in the childish night my companions lay frozen the stiff furs knocked at my starveling throat and i gave my great sigh the flakes came huddling were they really my end in the darkness i turned to my rest —here the flag snaps in the glare and silence of the unbroken ice i stand here the dogs bark my beard is black and i stare at the north pole and now what why go back turn as i please my step is to the south the world—my world spins on this final point of cold and wretchedness all lines all winds end in this whirlpool i at last discover and it is meaningless in the child 's bed after the night 's voyage in that warm world where people work and suffer for the end that crowns the pain—in that cloud-cuckoo-land i reached my north and it had meaning here at the actual pole of my existence where all that i have done is meaningless where i die or live by accident alone— where living or dying i am still alone here where north the night the berg of death crowd me out of the ignorant darkness i see at last that all the knowledge i wrung from the darkness—that the darkness flung me— is worthless as ignorance nothing comes from nothing the darkness from the darkness pain comes from the darkness and we call it wisdom it is pain

i gilgamesh spoke and said to the old man then '' when i looked at you i thought that you were not a man one made like me i had resolved to challenge you as one might challenge a demon a stranger-adversary but now i see that you are utnapishtim made like me a man the one i sought the one from whom i might find out how death can be avoided tell me then father how it came about that you were admitted to the company of gods who granted you eternal life '' the father utnapishtim spoke and said '' i will tell gilgamesh the king the story a secret of the gods i will disclose there was an ancient city shuruppak— you know of it—most fortunate of cities god-favored on the banks of the euphrates the gods in heaven decided in their council to bring the flood down on the fortunate city they sat in secret council together deciding anu was there the councilor enlil ninurta of the silence and there also was the god ennugi monitor of canals and there was ea cleverest of the gods the voice of ea telling me the secret came whispering through the reed walls of my house 'you reed house walls listen and hear me whisper listen and be attentive to what i tell you utnapishtim son of ubartutu abandon your house abandon what you possess abandon your house and build a boat instead seek life instead of riches save yourself take with you on the boat you build an instance of each thing living so that they may be safe from obliteration in the flood perform the construction of the boat with care let the length of the boat and the width of the boat be equal roof over the boat as the abyss is roofed the whispering voice spoke through the rustling walls you reed house walls listen and hear what i say i listened and heard and spoke to the whispering voice 'i hear what you say what will i tell the others what will i tell the old men and the people ea the god whispered to me his servant 'tell them you can no longer live in the city because you are out of favor with enlil the city is the city of enlil and therefore utnapishtim whom he hates must find another domicile and another god who will be his patron and protector and you have therefore decided to depart from shuruppak and seek another home tell them ea the god will be your patron whose domicile is apsu the abyss under the roof of apsu is where you go as for the city fortunate shuruppak in the morning dawning abundance will then rain down there will be plenty a flood of bounty the city teeming with heaven 's profusion game birds falling fishes unheard-of before in song or story tumbling loaves of fresh-baked morning bread grain will come showering in from all the grain fields a harvest of everything yes more than enough these are the things to tell the elders and people ii '' in the first hours of the early morning dawning all the people came out for the boat-building the little children the weak as well as the strong everyone carrying something asphalt and oil and pitch the best of timber with which to build day after day i labored building the boat ten times a dozen cubits were the walls ten times a dozen cubits was each deck there were six decks the cabin was divided into nine compartments i made up the plans i drew a picture of them for our guidance i hammered the boat together and plugged the holes with water plugs to keep the water out i made the bitumen pitch in the pitch kiln three sar of bitumen pitch to caulk the hull and to be certain three sar to caulk the inside i counted punting poles and put them aboard i had the basket bearers stow the supplies of oil and foodstuffs everything i needed as for the people who came to help in the work each day was like a new year 's holiday i slaughtered sheep and bullocks for their feasting for drinking there was wine and beer plenty as if there was a river overflowing on the seventh day i finished building the boat i opened a bowl of ointment for my hands i commanded the loading of everything i owned that could be carried silver and gold and all the instances of living things to be saved from obliteration in the flood and all my household people i took with me at sunset on that day i launched the boat the launching was very hard to manage it took much shifting and much maneuvering on the ways to get the unwieldy boat down into the river and two-thirds of its weight under the water in order to prevent it from capsizing as darkness was coming on i heard the god 'abundance will rain down more than enough get yourself inside and close the hatch i saw the signs of morning in the sky 'abundance will rain down more than enough i got myself inside and closed the hatch to puzuramurri the caulker who outside caulked up the hatch with pitch i gave my house iii '' in the early hours of the next morning dawning there was the noise of adad in the clouds that rose and filled the morning sky with blackness shullat the herald of the dread adad moved out over the mountains and over the valleys bellowing hanish the herald of the dread adad moved over the plains and over the cities everything turned to darkness as to night from time to time the annunaki blazed terrible light then rain came down in floods beneath the god of the underworld nergal broke down his own doorposts and opened the earth ninurta god of chaos and of war opened the dikes and other floods burst forth the south wind rushed in flooding over the mountains brother could not see brother in the welter none of the gods in heaven could see the earth the land was shattered like a shattered pot confusions of dread adad were everywhere terrified gods got themselves up as high as they could go nearest the highest heaven cringing against the wall like beaten dogs ishtar cried out like a woman in her birth pangs the sweet-voiced lady cried `` the days that were have now become as featureless as clay because of what i said when i went to the gods in heaven bringing calamity down on those whom now the sea engulfs and overwhelms my children who are now the children of fish the annunaki sat and wept with her the cowering gods wept covering their mouths six days and nights the storm went on this way the south wind flooding over the mountains and valleys until the seventh day when the storm birth labor subsided at last the flood subsided at last i opened the hatch the daylight touched my face i looked outside nothing was moving at all it looked as flat as a flat clay roof looks flat and all the human beings had turned to clay i fell to my knees and wept the tears ran down the sides of my nose i wept in the total silence i looked outside and looked as far as i could trying to find looking across the world something and then far off something was there what looked like signs of an island could faintly be seen and then the boat was caught and held from under by the peak rock of a mountain under the water it was mount nisir the boat was grounded on a first day it was held and a second day a third day the boat was held from under and a fourth day and a fifth a sixth day and then on the seventh day i freed a dove the dove flew free and flew away from the boat seeking a place for its little feet to alight and finding none flew back to the boat to perch i freed a swallow then and it flew free and flew away from the boat seeking a place for its little feet to alight and finding none flew back to the boat to find a place to alight i freed a raven then and it flew free and flew away from the boat and never returned it had found a place to alight and circled about the place and alighted and settled itself and ate and never after that returned to the boat then i set free all the other birds in the boat and they flew free scattering to the winds iv '' i went ashore and offered a sacrifice i poured out a libation i set out seven vessels of offerings on a stand and then set seven more i made a fire of wood of myrtle wood of cane and wood of cedar i lit the fire the odor touched the nostrils of the igigi gods and gave them pleasure i slaughtered a sheep to make a sacrifice the gods collected like flies about the altar the great goddess progenitrix ishtar came down from heaven wearing about her neck the pendant anu gave her for her adornment of lapis lazuli ornately made she said 'just as this pendant never shall forgotten be by the goddess so the goddess never will forget calamitous days the gods may come to the ritual but forbidden is the presence of enlil by whose command the flood was peremptorily brought down on the heads of all my children engulfing them when the god enlil came to the sacrifice he saw the boat and the sight filled him with rage he spoke in anger to the gathered gods 'how is it that one man has saved himself no breath of life was meant to be kept safe from its obliteration in the flood ninurta opened his mouth and said to the god 'ea the cleverest of the gods deviser let ea speak and give enlil his answer then ea opened his mouth and said to the god '' the punishment should always fit the crime let him who has performed an evil act be punished for that act let not the flood be brought down on the heads of all for what one man has done and he who has transgressed show pity to him lest he be cut off from all his fellows better that a lion should come into the village and prey upon it taking a few than that the flood drown all better a wolf should find its ravening way into the fold devouring some much better than that the flood turn all that breathes to clay better that famine starve a few of them than that a harvest of waters obliterate all better that erra the plague god better that he take hold of some seize them and bear them away to the underworld than that the flood drown all i did not tell the secret to the man he listened to the wind and guessed the secret let the gods sitting in council now decide how to reward the wise man for his wisdom the god enlil then went on board the boat he took me by the hand and made me kneel he took my wife by the hand and made her kneel the god then touched our foreheads blessing us and said 'you were but human now you are admitted into the company of gods your dwelling place shall be the faraway the place which is the source of the outflowing of all the rivers of the world there are and so they led us to the faraway the place we dwell in now which is the source of all the rivers flowing through the world '' then scornful utnapishtim said to the king '' tell me who would bring all the gods together so that for you they might in council decide what your deserving is that you be granted admittance into the company of gods let there be now a test of gilgamesh let him but keep himself awake for a week six nights and seven days to show his worth '' so gilgamesh sat down to begin the test v almost as soon as gilgamesh the king sat down to test himself a mist of sleep as ocean mist comes over the shore from the waters came over his eyes and so the strongest slept then utnapishtim spoke to his wife and said '' see how this hero sleeps who asks for life as ocean mist blows over the land from the waters so the mist of sleep comes over the eyes of the king '' the wife of utnapishtim answered him '' touch and awaken him so that he may return in safety to his native city entering through the gate of his departure '' but utnapishtim said `` man is deceitful therefore he will deceive us every day as he lies sleeping you must bake a wafer and place the wafer near him making a mark upon the nearby wall for every day this hero sleeps who seeks eternal life '' she baked a wafer every day of bread for every day that gilgamesh lay sleeping the first wafer was dry as dust the second only less so than the first the third was soggy and rotten the fourth wafer was white in the crust there were spots of mold on the fifth the sixth wafer looked almost as if it was fresh and the seventh—gilgamesh started and waked up as utnapishtim touched him on the forehead gilgamesh said `` i had almost fallen asleep when you reached out and touched me and kept me awake '' but utnapishtim said to gilgamesh '' look at the wafers and look at the marks on the wall a mark and a wafer for every day you have slept the first wafer is dry as dust the second is only less so than the first the third is soggy and rotten the fourth wafer is white in the crust there are spots of mold on the fifth the sixth wafer looks almost as if it is fresh and the seventh—but it is then that you awoke '' then gilgamesh said to him `` what shall i do who takes us away has taken hold of me death is in my chamber when i sleep and death is there wherever i set foot '' vi utnapishtim said to the boatman then '' though your delight has been to cross the waters the harbor now is closed the crossing forbidden the waters and the shore now shun the boatman the hairy-bodied man you brought across the perilous waters wearing the skin of a beast that hides his beauty let urshànabi take him to the washing place there let him wash his body washing away the filth that hides his beauty manifest be the beauty of gilgamesh take the skin of a beast he wore on the journey and throw it away in the sea let gilgamesh bind up his shining hair with a new fillet let him put on a spotless festal robe let him return to his native city in honor in the royal garments appropriate to himself '' the boatman led the king to the washing place gilgamesh washed his body washing away the filth that obscured his beauty then urshànabi took the skin of a beast and threw it away manifest was the beauty of gilgamesh he bound up his shining hair with a new fillet he put on a festal robe utterly spotless a royal garment appropriate to himself then he and the boatman boarded the little boat and the boat began to move away from the shore but the wife of utnapishtim said to her husband '' this man has undergone a terrible journey what will you give him for his return to his city '' gilgamesh hearing took up his punting pole and brought the little boat back to the shore utnapishtim spoke and said to him '' gilgamesh you who have made the terrible journey what shall i give you for your return to your city '' then utnapishtim said to gilgamesh '' a secret of the gods i will disclose there is a plant that grows under the waters thorny to seize as a rose is thorny to seize how-the-old-man-once-again-becomes-a-young-man is the name of the plant that grows under the waters descend into the waters and seize the plant '' so gilgamesh tied heavy stone weights to his feet to bring him down through the waters of the abyss to the place where he could find the magic plant he seized the thorny plant that cut his hands he cut the stone weights loose from his heavy feet and the waters cast him up upon the shore vii gilgamesh said to urshànabi the boatman '' urshànabi this plant is a wonderful plant new life may be obtained by means of it i will carry the thorny plant back to my city i will give some of the plant to the elders there to share among them telling them it is called how-the-old-man-once-again-becomes-a-young-man and i will take my share of the magic plant once more to become the one who is youngest and strongest '' viii at twenty leagues they stopped only to eat at thirty leagues they stopped to rest for the night gilgamesh found a spring a pool of pure water he entered the water to refresh himself in the reeds nearby a serpent of the place became aware of the fragrance of the plant breathed its perfume desired it and approached and stole away with it among the reeds as it disappeared the serpent shed its skin when gilgamesh found out what the serpent had done he sat down weeping by the pool of water he took urshànabi by the hand and said '' what shall i do the journey has gone for nothing for whom has my heart 's blood been spent for whom for the serpent who has taken away the plant i descended into the waters to find the plant and what i found was a sign telling me to abandon the journey and what it was i sought for '' ix at twenty leagues they stopped only to eat at thirty leagues they stopped to rest for the night and so they traveled until they reached uruk there gilgamesh the king said to the boatman '' study the brickwork study the fortification climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace study how it is made from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields the ponds and orchards one league is the inner city another league is orchards still another the fields beyond over there is the precinct of the temple three leagues and the temple precinct of ishtar measure uruk the city of gilgamesh ''
to a man who maintained that the mausoleum is the stateliest possible manner of interment i would be one with the dark dark earth — follow the plough with a yokel tread i would be part of the indian corn walking the rows with the plumes o'erhead i would be one with the lavish earth eating the bee-stung apples red walking where lambs walk on the hills by oak-grove paths to the pools be led i would be one with the dark-bright night when sparkling skies and the lightning wed— walking on with the vicious wind by roads whence even the dogs have fled i would be one with the sacred earth on to the end till i sleep with the dead terror shall put no spears through me peace shall jewel my shroud instead i shall be one with all pit-black things finding their lowering threat unsaid stars for my pillow there in the gloom — oak-roots arching about my head stars like daisies shall rise through the earth acorns fall round my breast that bled children shall weave there a flowery chain squirrels on acorn-hearts be fed — fruit of the traveller-heart of me fruit of my harvest-songs long sped sweet with the life of my sunburned days when the sheaves were ripe and the apples red
the morning coffee i 'm not sure why i drink it maybe it 's the ritual of the cup the spoon the hot water the milk and the little heap of brown grit the way they come together to form a nail i can hang the day on it 's something to do between being asleep and being awake surely there 's something better to do though than to drink a cup of instant coffee such as meditate about what about having a cup of coffee a cup of coffee whose first drink is too hot and whose last drink is too cool but whose many in-between drinks are like baby bear 's por- ridge just right papa bear looks disgruntled he removes his spectacles and swivels his eyes onto the cup that sits before baby bear and then after a discrete cough reaches over and picks it up baby bear doesn't understand this disruption of the morning routine papa bear brings the cup close to his face and peers at it intently the cup shatters in his paw explodes actually sending fragments and brown liquid all over the room in a way it 's good that mama bear is n't there better that she rest in her grave beyond the garden unaware of what has happened to the world
i don ’ t mind the ring roads or the strange intersections filled in with radio music tarmac skirting streetlight and the dissolving moon wing mirrors tell of running trees my heart races in the heave of the wind in the pivot of glass everything is so small and manageable i think of an old song of purple cows in far fields i wonder what it ’ d take to cover miles and miles with no maps or destination it is not easy anymore to forget or be free of the bear that roams the place where i come from

at sixteen i worked after high school hours at a printing plant that manufactured legal pads yellow paper stacked seven feet high and leaning as i slipped cardboard between the pages then brushed red glue up and down the stack no gloves fingertips required for the perfection of paper smoothing the exact rectangle sluggish by 9 pm the hands would slide along suddenly sharp paper and gather slits thinner than the crevices of the skin hidden then the glue would sting hands oozing till both palms burned at the punchclock ten years later in law school i knew that every legal pad was glued with the sting of hidden cuts that every open lawbook was a pair of hands upturned and burning

often i had gone this way before but now it seemed i never could be and never had been anywhere else 'twas home one nationality we had i and the birds that sang one memory they welcomed me i had come back that eve somehow from somewhere far the april mist the chill the calm meant the same thing familiar and pleasant to us and strange too yet with no bar the thrush on the oaktop in the lane sang his last song or last but one and as he ended on the elm another had but just begun his last they knew no more than i the day was done then past his dark white cottage front a labourer went along his tread slow half with weariness half with ease and through the silence from his shed the sound of sawing rounded all that silence said

the sun used to shine while we two walked slowly together paused and started again and sometimes mused sometimes talked as either pleased and cheerfully parted each night we never disagreed which gate to rest on the to be and the late past we gave small heed we turned from men or poetry to rumours of the war remote only till both stood disinclined for aught but the yellow flavorous coat of an apple wasps had undermined or a sentry of dark betonies the stateliest of small flowers on earth at the forest verge or crocuses pale purple as if they had their birth in sunless hades fields the war came back to mind with the moonrise which soldiers in the east afar beheld then nevertheless our eyes could as well imagine the crusades or caesar 's battles everything to faintness like those rumours fade— like the brook 's water glittering under the moonlight—like those walks now—like us two that took them and the fallen apples all the talks and silence—like memory 's sand when the tide covers it late or soon and other men through other flowers in those fields under the same moon go talking and have easy hours

so i say to my friend at the day job “ we are bored sometimes and scented like realtors but if everyone ’ s equally disconsolate under labor ’ s gooey caul then nuance can be stitched more vividly to secrets lodged inside of everyone until it becomes your own country with highways that carry you silently past the jetty which from their heavy drinking the case managers come out to failing to be stable and badly attempting to sing ” we ’ re pushing our barques past the mansions as i say this near the dwellings of persons whose lives have no mooring outside the slow fact of our passing— huddled arrogantly under their air-conditioning they want us to be users moved by advertisers enticing the constituency to join them and sit there and weep but we ’ re too busy pulling toward centers where workers assemble while time for them is a melody played at long intervals across condominiums we who are the power know our systems so much better now come to this hour outside it now give it new form on guitar
hay golpes en la vida tan fuertes ... yo no sé — césar vallejo they sniffed us out of the holes with the animals they had programmed and there are blows in life so powerful we just don ’ t know and there were trenches and there was water and it poured in through our mouths and out of our ears and there were things we saw in the sand at that moment of sinking mountains and daisies and tulips and rivers and the bodies of the people we had been and the bodies of the people we had loved and we felt hooks coming through the trenches and we felt hooks coming through the sand and i saw hooks coming through my child ’ s clothes and i wanted him to know that they would never be able to scoop us out of the sand but of course it wasn ’ t true they had scooped us out of the sand and our mouths were so full of dirt it is what they do when you ’ re dead and they made us spit and they beat us until our mouths were empty and they paid us for constructing the mountain and it was me and l and we looked for s and we looked for j and j and we looked for o and we looked for r and we looked for j and s in the holes in which the bodies of those we loved were hiding or dying or sinking or stealing some shelter some little worm ’ s worth of cover to keep their bodies from dissolving into the maniac murmurs of this impossible carcass economy
the fair rolled into town surprisingly intact like a plate unbreakable because it has been dropped and glued so many times that it is all glue and no plate the fair was no fair but oh it was a thrill the fair slid into town just as a clown slides into pants the fit was loose but right the sheriff had a job directing traffic the barber was the sheriff for a night and people paid to see a human ape they frowned to find her happy and alive the fair spilled into town like a box of tacks later that month in with the rest at church were people no one knew though none could tell exactly who was who
i only have a moment so let me tell you the shortest story about arriving at a long loved place the house of friends in maine their lawn of wildflowers their grandfather clock and candid portraits their gabled attic rooms and woodstove in the kitchen all accessories of the genuine summer years before when i was their son ’ s girlfriend and tied an apron behind my neck beneath my braids and took from their garden the harvest for a dinner i would make alone and serve at their big table with the gladness of the found and loved the eggplant shone like polished wood the tomatoes smelled like their furred collars the dozen zucchini lined up on the counter like placid troops with the onions their minions and i even remember the garlic each clove from its airmail envelope brought to the cutting board ready for my instruction and in this very slight story a decade later i came by myself having been dropped by the airport cab and waited for the family to arrive home from work i walked into the lawn waist-high in the swaying purple lupines the subject of june ’ s afternoon light as i had never been addressed — a displaced young woman with cropped hair no place to which i wished to return and no one to gather me in his arms that day the lupines received me and i was in love with them because they were all i had left and in that same manner i have loved much of the world since then and who is to say there is more of a reason or more to love
my brother wore bags over his boots to keep the grease grime from his time at the steel mill off the carpet steps he mounted heaving each foot like a monster born of the grave -yard shift — stiff awkward his arms smeared w/dark matter the lather of machine industry bathing his clothes face in a glaze of sweat smoke oil the dirt of what ’ s been done before — the work of uncles cousins who wore the same jumpsuit goggles gloves to grab hold of cold finished bars using their backs shoulders to move the weight around w/the help of machines the knobs to control the two-ton bundles held by a buckle above the heads of hard-hatted men that could snap let loose the mass of all that metal meant to weld into a foundation a beginning to build upon when it was his time to work to clock in clean leave feeling filthy no matter the shift or stiffness in the bones creaking like the wooden stairs he climbed

terrace deep as the sky stone bench where i sit and read i wandered by myself into the heart of the mountains of yoshino in one hand a book in the other a bag made of newsprint— no weather-beaten bones here just lychees bought in the market thirty rupees per kilogram stalks mottled red tied up with string flesh the color of pigeon wings— sweet simmering sunlight bruises air pine trees blacken where shall i go the dhauladhar peaks are covered in snow
—at dubai international airport and ending with a line by césar vallejo because i must walk through the eye-shaped shadows cast by these curved gold leaves thick atop each constructed palm tree past displays of silk scarves lit silhouettes of blue-bottled perfume—because i grip as though for the first time a paper bag of french fries from mcdonald 's and lick from each fingertip the fat and salt as i stand alone to the side of this moving walkway gliding me past dark- eyed men who do not look away when i stare squarely back—because standing in line to the restroom i want only to pluck from her black sweater this one shimmering blond hair clinging fast— because i must rest the coke cold in my hand beside this toilet seat warmed by her thighs her thighs and hers here at the narrow mouth of this long humid corridor leading to the plane i take my place among this damp dark horde of men and women who look like me— because i look like them— because i am ashamed of their bodies that reek so unabashedly of body— because i can—because i am an american a star of blood on the surface of muscle
today the date palms were pruned the branches taken before the fruit ripened before sweetness littered the sidewalks the man who sawed them worked alone a crane lifting him to the yellowed fronds beside his truck he stood tall american a pensive pioneer the top of each palm looked like the back of a man 's head after a close-crop haircut the neck cooled to a stubbly remembrance of hair or was like a cat after being spayed startled by a strange newness pacing familiar rooms darting confused and you had you wished to console are greeted with a barren gaze the rubble of bark and fronds reminded me of iraq not the ruined bridges or the surrendering soldiers hands begging food but the 16 million date palms one per capita lining the seams of the tigris and euphrates a reminder of my own libya and its 10 million date palms and the years of easy wealth that brought them neglect except in huun a magical city where they stuffed dates with almonds and sent them as far as tanta and oum dourman from huun this story a boy stands by a palm imploring his uncle to toss him a fistful of dates flustered by the boy 's monotonous cries the uncle loses his feet and as he falls to his death cries down `` here nephew i 'm coming down with the dates '' so that 's what we got from huun almond stuffed wonders and proverbial last words there was another reminder a tale of the prophet muhammad living for months on water and coarse wheat bread his wives protesting the austere measures of his faith muhammad who praised honey and had a professed love for cantaloupes and who once declared `` the best meat is that which lines the bones '' found in dates the solution he required to his arab followers and to his wives the fruit was `` three skies above luxury '' and as indispensable as water and air i once had this dream of whitman i found him under one of the palms on sherman way gazing admiring though he had seen palms by the gulf of mexico he had never tasted a date so we drove to a supermarket and he who had been thoughtful even dignified until then began to sign and moan at the taste of `` araby's sugared dust clouds '' when we walked the aisles he insisted on pushing the cart the frozen foods did not surprise him since his granny buried potatoes in the cold dirt of her homestead still i had to explain tofu plastic tacos and the foods labeled free he ran his hands caressing the waxed floor '' smooth as a girl 's wrist '' he exclaimed the bright fluorescent lights reminded hirn of the opera and walt sang a gravelly tune the children sitting in carts reached for him their hands were lorca 's butterflies on his beard at the cashier he filled pockets with candy and was shocked by the headlines of our news honda toyota saturn oldsmobile— in the parking lot the names waltzed on his tongue at the fast food stand he ate heartily the burger 's slipperiness amused him and at his clumsiness we both had a laugh then the talk grew quiet the table stretching like the expanse of time dividing us i felt he no longer wanted company having begun to understand our world despite his old resentment of blacks and now my neighbors the foreign-born hispanics and their engines roaring through balboa and saticoy and the koreans karoake— the baseline 's muffled thuds voices doused in canadian mist and the off-key pleadings to the lover who never comes— america remained to him luminous-industrial-fuming- sublime and as he wished beyond others' adjectives beyond what anyone could have conceived mumbling a farewell whitman stood to leave and with this my dream ended whitman wishing to depart and i holding on to his wrists all day i wanted to hold his wide wrists if you drive west of alexandria your path will run through alamain barani and matrouh then egypt will end with a town on a steep hill called sallum if you go through the two checkpoints libya will unfold its dry pastures for you on the sallum hill there is a hotel where people stay to await relatives crossing the border or to hear word if it is safe to return across the road a tired bluegreen tea house sits like a bruise permanently on the verge of fading from the prairies skin you will also see the money changers— all teenage boys with their right hands they will wave thick wads of money at your windshield and with their left they will jostle to give you the best rate the last time i stayed in sallum few cars came from either direction and among the boys fights flared with curses and stones hurled at brows when the boys rabble grew loud a man lazily stepped out of the tea house to call them bastards and sons of whores this went on for hours until the sun settled in the middle of the sky the boys taking shelter under a torn canvas shed and the man to the tea house 's dusty cool then just when all movement and noise seemed to surrender to the september wind and heat four of the boys broke for a run racing—money still clutched in their hands— to a young date palm in the distance pressing shoulders and backs against it they shook the palm until the season's first fruit began to rain the other boys joined them and soon the tea house emptied of the men slouching inside those were my brothers who cowered beneath the date palm to gather handfuls of fruit rubbing each date clean on their sleeves chewing softly to savor the taste as though it were a good omen and rising to resume their lives on their faces the smiles of those who once were blessed

today there has been so much talk of things exploding into other things so much that we all become curious that we all run outside into the hot streets and hug romance is a grotto of eager stones anticipating light or a girl whose teeth you can always see with more sparkle and pop is the only way to live your confetti tongue explodes into acid jazz small typewriters that other people keep in their eyes click away at all our farewell parties it is hard to pack for the rest of your life someone is always eating cold cucumber noodles someone will drop by later to help dismantle some furniture a lot can go wrong if you sleep or think but the trees go on waving their broken little hands

it was the fruit i wanted not the nest the nest was hanging like the richest fruit against the sun i took the nest and with it came the heart and in my hand the kingdom and the queen frail surfaces rested for a moment then the drones awoke and did their painful business i let the city drop upon the stones it split to its deep palaces and combs it bled the insect gold the pupa queens like tiny eyes wriggled from their sockets and somewhere the monarch cowered in a veil of wings in passages through which at evening the labourers had homed burdened with silence and the garden scents the secret heart was broken suddenly i to whom the knowledge had been given who was not after knowledge but a fruit remember how a knot of pains swelled my hand to a round nest blood throbbed in the hurt veins as if an unseen swarm mined there the nest oozed bitter honey i swaddled my fat hand in cotton after a week pain gave it back to me scarred and weakened like a shrivelled skin a second fruit is growing on the tree identical—the droning in the leaves it ripens i have another hand

boston 1973—years had passed and i assumed a different life when one night while resting from books on marlborough street where things like this can happen there came into my room images in black-and-white with a flow of light that would not die it all came back to me in different terms characters were born again met up with each other in adult life drifted across the screen to discover cattle and oil traveled miles on horseback in dust and heat characters whose names emerged as if they mattered in a history book some were swept up by power and prejudice toward neighbors different from themselves because that is what the picture is about with class distinctions moving the plot along a few could distinguish right from wrong those who could not you condemned from the beginning when you noticed them at all still others married or backed off from the ranch with poignant flair like james dean who in the middle of grazing land unearthed the treasures of oil buried his soul in money and went incoherent with alcohol when the 40's came two young men were drafted the one called angel dying at war it 's a generational tale so everybody aged once more and said what they had to say along the way according to the script and then the end the hamburger joint brought into existence to the beat of '' the yellow rose of texas '' juana and her child the color of dark amber foreshadowing the mexican-looking couple and their daughter all in muteness wanting to be served i climbed out of bed and in my head was a roaring of light—words spoken and unspoken had brought the obliterated back not again i said from my second-floor room ... let this not be happening three and-a-half hours had flicked by as the sound trailed off into nothing memory would not dissolve

on one occasion yūgen of ise province was offering to share for a night or two the comforts of his home with me when a distant bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day then to a degree i would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice so worn out not even sure i was on the right road i forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand-in-hand in the same direction both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire but i am so tired i heard my own voice say one of them that startlingly cruel intrusive voice i hate darkening everything how sick i am of listening to it and of having to go on but after some time had passed once again i forgot all about it as i sat there the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or perhaps a hidden joy of my own one i had so long considered extinct when yūgen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking renga competitions and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again i think of her sometimes moon come down and come alone i have to tell you all about akechi ’ s wife — bashō translated by franz wright

i drank and was surprised to see what looked like tea leaves at the bottom of the cup minutes later a great warm green wave or cloud began advancing towards me “ look at the boats on his shirt ” i felt myself trying to say in spanish or moroccan yet knowing i knew none of the words it was bright morning and the train had arrived and emptied at chamartín before i finally pried open my eyes and saw on the carriage floor nothing but an unfamiliar pair of trainers cracked white leather with three green stripes “ mister — or rather herr — adolf dassler made these ” i thought but which of the two friendly men with whom i ’ d shared the carriage and some wine had been wearing them i pondered this awhile then fell asleep again and did herr dassler visit personally all the cities inscribed on his trainers koln dublin paris montreal kopenhagen bern amsterdam and fit the trainer to the city rom like these vienna london señor dassler i am dreaming of you on a bench on a platform in a train station in madrid unable to wake up a pair of your trainers that weren ’ t mine but now are on my feet i am swimming herr dassler in your wake though i fear you are dead a corpse washed clean by the numbing tides with three slanting stripes emblazoned on your chest your passport and your wallet drifting to the ocean floor i discovered in a pocket — oh the kindness of strangers — about forty pesetas but casting around for a joke or silver lining i found nada — or niente as i put it to my shoes closing my eyes i imagined fingers untying and easing off my reeboks as the train hurtled through the darkness the men trying them on in turn the ex-owner of these flexing his toes padding up and down nodding approval they must have whispered like parents as they lifted my shirt and unfastened my money belt or perhaps more like surgeons they used scissors or a knife snicker-snack i watched the vorpal blade trace arabesques across my breastbone hover then slide between two ribs chug-chug went the trains the heat was building the potion at last wearing off how light i ’ d be i now began to reason as quick and canny as a lizard a perfectly camouflaged lizard who ’ d shed a skin and acquired a new way of walking
the unrestricted sun had split the day in two and now we went on the edge of the afternoon like a tableau of bent figures made of faded blue duck we went like a wandering and stinking sweating brotherhood pull by pull between the leafy cotton plants with the pathetic appearance of arriving at the end of the furrow but we always arrived in a rush to get there and the sole logic was we had to move over to the next furrow and no one could stop the counterflow down it and i the dusty kid left behind in the middle of the field held prisoner in my own slow shadow was right in not giving in to the absurd pace of tradition so my days burned up in that captive state of childhood then yes it was then the venturesomeness of sedition overtook me saturdays after noon the body finally lying down in the waves of the aluminum bathtub and in the liberating rite of the water i could shed the grime and contemplate the muddy waters of time so it was with the ablution of the weekly bath i exiled myself each time from what i was
you ’ re stepping on your father my mother said and indeed i was standing exactly in the center of a bed of grass mown so neatly it could have been my father ’ s grave although there was no stone saying so you ’ re stepping on your father she repeated louder this time which began to be strange to me since she was dead herself even the doctor had admitted it i moved slightly to the side to where my father ended and my mother began the cemetery was silent wind blew through the trees i could hear very faintly sounds of weeping several rows away and beyond that a dog wailing at length these sounds abated it crossed my mind i had no memory of being driven here to what now seemed a cemetery though it could have been a cemetery in my mind only perhaps it was a park or if not a park a garden or bower perfumed i now realized with the scent of roses — douceur de vivre filling the air the sweetness of living as the saying goes at some point it occurred to me i was alone where had the others gone my cousins and sister caitlin and abigail by now the light was fading where was the car waiting to take us home i then began seeking for some alternative i felt an impatience growing in me approaching i would say anxiety finally in the distance i made out a small train stopped it seemed behind some foliage the conductor lingering against a doorframe smoking a cigarette do not forget me i cried running now over many plots many mothers and fathers — do not forget me i cried when at last i reached him madam he said pointing to the tracks surely you realize this is the end the tracks do not go further his words were harsh and yet his eyes were kind this encouraged me to press my case harder but they go back i said and i remarked their sturdiness as though they had many such returns ahead of them you know he said our work is difficult we confront much sorrow and disappointment he gazed at me with increasing frankness i was like you once he added in love with turbulence now i spoke as to an old friend what of you i said since he was free to leave have you no wish to go home to see the city again this is my home he said the city — the city is where i disappear
it ’ s you i ’ d like to see greece again with you i ’ d like to take to bed of cyclamen you know i nurse a certain myth about myself that i descend de tribus d ’ origine asiatique and am part thracian or macedonian cleaving to a hellenic mystique after centuries ’ migration inland a full moon rising over the acropolis i can repeat the scene this time à deux as then i had no one to kiss slicing halloumi amid the hullabaloo of a rooftop taverna in july the doors that opened to lovers pulled like tree roots from darkness i close upon us now like book covers the alcove in which we embrace is cool with brilliant tile and weirded by a dove ’ s note chase of ouzo with uzi junta-style history makes its noise we duck till it passes love we think is our due not we think like the epoch the unchosen thing we ’ re wedded to

roy halston frowick 1932–1990 he kept his middle name the pick of the lot he thought and mispronounced himself hall-stun at bergdorf ’ s he acquired an accent and referred to himself in the third person every bird he flayed wrapped in ultrasuede he lit a true with a true smeared his hirsute muse with sequins there were air- kisses capote ’ s new-cut face at studio 54 that baccarat flute of ejaculate never too late he ordered in meat and potatoes and a trick he called it “ dial-a-steak dial-a-dick. ” he appeared on the love boat halstonettes in tow maybe the high maybe the low watermark when his pupils betrayed him at work on came the shades and a well-cut blazer paranoia he had signed away the rights to his name for options when he tried to reclaim them from the conglomerate he excused himself to the toilet just a sec — white dust on a black turtleneck his block started to look a lot like sickness even his beloved orchids the sickness just like that the eighties were gone new york new york the eighties were no one
for d ’ andra my bowl brimming with pretzels the snack you wanted least i slid open the door of our sleeping car where we had been enjoying the country rushing by as if we were the first two people to look down into the valleys and see bright necks of pines stretch across farms and streams to the groves they once cradled you had asked for earl grey cookies sandwiched around buttercream or marshmallows made of chocolate but all the tea bags had been dunked and the chocolate melted over biscotti when i came bearing the salted and twisted news the room was empty but for a heel it was black as a bunting and wound with zippers and every time the car rocked it looked ready to fly and escape into the cold tangled air of travel that always feels heavy with joy and desire and a little sadness always a little sadness because of the leaving which is what i do when i realize i ’ m in the wrong room and that numbers have betrayed me again while i was hunting and gathering foraging like homo habilis who probably never lost his cave out of patience i opened every door marked with threes and eights those conjoined twins disastrously separated at birth and roused the scabbed eyes of sleepers like a beggar no an angel a begging angel who has written on his heart will work for love having not found our room not heard the sharp swing of your voice i descended upon the passenger cars and row upon row of couples asleep or staring out the windows like zombies trying to remember what happens next once the newspaper is well-thumbed the tea has gone cold and the conversation is dead i called for you in vain even using your secret names the ones only the night knows wind-kiss brilliant-fruit dervish-moon over and over i said your names over and over until they filled the wounded air of the car and when there was no more room for another sound they caught and hooked the ring of the brakes hugging the rails just when i thought i wouldn ’ t find you you were there the train was pulling away and i was watching you slowly eat a dish of whipped cream and bananas — the house special — in a cafe in a city we didn ’ t know when you finished we started walking down a road that bent like a smile a shy smile like the one the japanese cat wore on your purse the road we were told would take us to the end of the line where all lovers in search of joy packed on bullet trains — they ’ re the fastest on two continents — arrive every hour
we have had our lives the reservoir visible in the window beside our elbows and the willow branches trailing at our stop are the nature we leave behind us gladly since it has no place for all we have recently learned that sex is temporary help ours to hand down now and materials science not the only kind we thank calm careful minerva goddess of adults who for so many years took us to school her voice the timbre of fretless bass her eyes the color of pencil lead she taught us how to behave in order to have our rewards in twenty years we have them and if we wish too often this fall to have led another life we do not mean that we would give up ours though we stand in a row and sway before an obstructed view we are able to find initials outlined in the crosshatched trees and pebbles—calculi—around our ponds and cherish them we like to watch the roads along which the perennial pollen sifts down as finely as ever making a soft powder of brass amid the troughs in softball fields our skills are finally in demand if you mock us pan in whom we also believe do it as gently as you can
there was a time we had functional alignment i was your individual contributor you my associate director on monday i said happy monday rolling my rimshot grin ring-fenced by cool molecules like cattle i battled biosimilars sipped local gin i tried my luck at affairs and trade fairs optimistic as a fantasy suite i inked the deal the ink slick and permanent like president reagan i didn ’ t sleep unless i felt sick something was always gated on a fragile something everything on the critical path the whiteboard cruel as conceptual math scope creep like a disease some of those days our parent showed up bespoke shoes bearing leckerli i felt like a starlet on a cruisy backlot an outpost of opportunity i took on a new role went through the motions and the typing pool but the bonus was no bonus any more than the bay like tender it started to fray my admin booked a good weekend of atrocity i winced i slid the to-hurt folder below a molecule ’ s package insert then came the efficiency report my resignation i packed up the brood for orlando a last resort i cut off my khaki pants at the knee traded in the wife — this is the epcot center of my life i want to thank you in advance i ’ d fallen out of favor like a nation
who can face the sea and not inherit its loneliness — olin ivory i gray sky gray sea — gray mind the man thinks he thinks to grow old with it and kicks a stone into the water he mucks at the seam and it crumbles below him a sea gull beaks a crab flights vertically and drops it to the rocks the man cracks with laughter tossing a stone to a stone ii working alone means the voice must grow louder for who can stand to think quietly all through the day ’ s calculations i can not i let the voice grow loud i let the voice hum outside my body in distinguishable phrasings and count the increments as i set the fence according to the blade all day i stand before a blade and push things into its path i stand aside as what is removed is whisked alongside me the smallest particles of what is removed thicken the air making a dream inside which one can not live all day the voice is learning how to be outside of the body iii a man is not a beach nor is he stone though he collects their entirety in a single thought he works alone and his thoughts begin to smack of stone his teeth clatter with their collection iv a man can hold a secret between his teeth and it will never leave his mouth for who would listen to his wavering tune of so sad and how hard and hear anything original he is that he is — the errand and the fool running to himself over and over only to find that even he is tired of telling about it to grow old with it was the task and the question always would he last a man can believe in the body and have no one as though he were ghost or stone nothing to speak at or be heard from v all work no pay makes a body bray though he may bray — though he may bray and bray forgive him the bit if he tells you his secret he will have no secret this is how one sings a sentence into stone
like all great rivers the elbe is familiar at first sight the barges spic span as the front parlors of model homes in saxony — the steam paddle-wheelers other vessels no less impeccable — all run with a near soporific efficiency you lean out the land starts up the parcels of pastures castles bearing with them trees cows cattle-grids the crowned heads of daisies little knots of human habitations cigarette factory garrisons floodplains sheet pilings run all run as if by an engine some cement breaker from under the river torn turfs all bob up down brown like bears in bear gardens the cupolas cavaliers their ruinous sandstone reflections alongside whether this is the famous effect of the balcony of europe cork coasters chasing gilt coronets maps loosely adrift on a map so many teacups clicking large balconies colliding breaking up into smaller ones valley vineyards mines bridges sugar-beet fields villas museum corridors a procession of princes chimera of chinese porcelain palaces cargoes of homeland meadows other municipalities the beer beer mats coal forestry history atop geography atop history flags roll unroll — coalesce black — red — yellow yellow black red runs white sunk trains with passengers trains sunk april ’ 45 bergen-belsen run elbe run i pulled away i have come this day to the bank of the elbe to write a few postcards in a tearoom on the steps up from street level to the old albertinum museum some way from the tearoom a man too is minding his business on his lap a glass case for keyboard 2 rows of colored sand in test tubes raspberry /burnt sienna /turquoise /prussian blue /lavender /ochre or neutral — just sand into a beer bottle he tips a little color before you know our man has tossed one up in the air like a baby caught it roundly by the heels too le voilà not one grain escapes it is shockproof waterproof a world like a swiss watch time-proof — you count three camels it looks like 4 — any number could have been packed in the bottle which when turned slowly in the palm an orderly procession camels against a horizon of low sun an irradiated sky palm tree undulating dunes a strata of deep watermelon subsiding to honey halva the silhouette of a tent hint of a sandstorm in the air grit under eyelids should you prefer from the array of bottles you could take home one with a full sun an egyptian sun-disk you have his word — no fear each hermetically sealed will travel as if to say not all the grains are sand our man also works with rice he ’ s a jeweler he will encrypt on a grain of rice a word enclosed in a colored phial of water again hermetically for all time like the camels a jewel he said the word a ruby an emerald of water should you forget here his english broke off but you understand yes there is closure as i watched a lady at my elbow like one at a séance asked for the name “ christine ” her grand daughter she said he our scribe answered he was from iran — not that anyone inquired iranian then — hence the camels though here in dresden he had looked mexican a second before i looked again saw that he could be from anywhere it depends on where you stand this man has for good or ill the face of the world which he bears sadly with some mirth i pulled away another moment i would have to come up with a name a word another world i was happy with my purchase of camels on the elbe back home it holds dresden the elbe for me in a bottle it runs for so long as anyone would care to look not a drop more i would have liked to write a card to the bottler addressing sands sands of the world thereof my migrant errant friend i wish you all the grains whatever you had set out for always sands enough to take you just where you stand waiting for your no 28 sunsets no 20 the watermelon sunrise no end of camels
i would drive the pre-dawn dark to stake my spot to fish for dinner to numb my hands in the ice bucket to pluck from the neat stack a herring to fit the skullcap and pierce the eye with a toothpick the body double-hooked my fingertips glimmering with the scales of the dead while the line whined free from the reel and the bait arced out over the tidal current on a point in view of the town where i lived where i had become a man with no money suddenly concerned only with money for there were mouths and i had helped to make them — the eddy swirled kept my line taut my whole body taut though a man a few down the row laughed sitting back on his bucket while he pulled in more fish than he could take i hated the other men hated the ones who caught nothing who crossed lines or hooked gulls who plucked even birds from the sky and slowly drew them in while they struggled and looked away even finally in the hands of the man who only wanted them free i climbed the breakwater and fished and spoke to no one i baited my line and thought of a woman who would carry my body over the threshold of our small white house simply with her eyes because i had brought something home for her for us our boys at my side while one fish was divided and indeed did feed many — now to sift the facts for truth i reeked of the sea and had nothing to show for it darkling saltwater for a dream and no other place to be
even alleged militants blame the vanishing of the summer sea ice on “ ghosts ” short version by albert ayler he disappeared while he was getting his sound together no one knows what happened but the water high in increments like a crown around his cries and glass is a liquid and you have to forgive your parents for whatever it is and they have to forgive themselves i would like to use this craft to fly with him i feel that saddle the morning after and try — again — warm in the habit of our warning and yearning for more of them until we finally need to see this reckoning but when it ’ s time i ’ m not ready and when i ’ m ready it ’ s not time — that ’ s fate and blind in the halo of so-what so-what we make it a future i say i don ’ t know who you are i say it don ’ t matter at this point i do it all for you anyways long run — gorgeous photographs of industrial ruins so lush you want to lick them be them become a trend crushed under the debris an instrument is so tender it breaks and mends in the same note becoming men is like that degrading uplifting denial lazily caving in isis and ice until all of our guesses are obsolete we can ’ t see nobody who isn ’ t disappearing
the only time i ’ ve been to switzerland was early one spring on a train through the mountains there was a lake—i guess it was lucerne above me cliff tops ridged with snow fanned out so that where i stood at the edge of the platform light bathed the empty siding all around with a diffused opalescence off the water behind the station must have been a town spires of churches municipal arcades and coffee squelching in the fogged cafés i never saw the place though i remember thinking this is switzerland and took a mind-shot of the pines breathing in the cold as the porter whistled at us to reboard
breathe deep even if it means you wrinkle your nose from the fake-lemon antiseptic of the mopped floors and wiped-down doorknobs the freshly soaped necks and armpits your teacher means well even if he butchers your name like he has a bloody sausage casing stuck between his teeth handprints on his white sloppy apron and when everyone turns around to check out your face no need to fush red and warm just picture all the eyes as if your classroom is one big scallop with its dozens of icy blues and you will remember that winter your family took you to the china sea and you sank your face in it to gaze at baby clams and sea stars the size of your outstretched hand and when all those necks start to crane try not to forget someone once lathered their bodies once patted them dry with a fluffy towel after a bath set out their clothes for the first day of school think of their pencil cases from third grade full of sharp pencils a pink pearl eraser think of their handheld pencil sharpener and its tiny blade
i saw another ladybug chicago could win if i eat the leftover fish chips in every line so i don ’ t forget we went to the river called fish chips we stayed at the fish chips tower they donated a million dollars to the fish chips foundation so we could go to school for free it ’ s called fish chips college for women
darlings if your owners say you are not usually like this then i must take them at their word i am like you not crazy about that which towers before me particularly the buildings here and the people inside who look at my name and make noises that seem like growling my small and eager darlings what it must be like to have the sound for love and the sound for fear be a matter of pitch i am afraid to touch anyone who might stay long enough to make leaving an echo there is a difference between burying a thing you love for the sake of returning and leaving a fresh absence in a city ’ s dirt looking for a mercy left by someone who came before you i am saying that i too am at a loss for language can ’ t beg myself a doorway out of anyone i am not usually like this either i must apologize again for how adulthood has rendered me us really i know you all forget the touch of someone who loves you in two minutes and i arrive to you a constellation of shadows once hands listen darlings there is a sky to be pulled down into our bowls there is a sweetness for us to push our faces into i promise i will not beg for you to stay this time i will leave you to your wild galloping i am sorry to hold you again for so long i am in the mood to be forgotten
your world is as big as you make it i know for i used to abide in the narrowest nest in a corner my wings pressing close to my side but i sighted the distant horizon where the skyline encircled the sea and i throbbed with a burning desire to travel this immensity i battered the cordons around me and cradled my wings on the breeze then soared to the uttermost reaches with rapture with power with ease
the whiskey stink of rot has settled in the garden and a burst of fruit flies rises when i touch the dying tomato plants still the claws of tiny yellow blossoms flail in the air as i pull the vines up by the roots and toss them in the compost it feels cruel something in me isn ’ t ready to let go of summer so easily to destroy what i ’ ve carefully cultivated all these months those pale flowers might still have time to fruit my great-grandmother sang with the girls of her village as they pulled the flax songs so old and so tied to the season that the very sound seemed to turn the weather
i could fix the leaky pipe under the sink or wander over and bother jerry who ’ s lost in the bog of his crankcase i could drive the half-mile down to the local mall and browse through the bright stables of mowers or maybe catch the power-walkers puffing away on their last laps i could clean the garage weed the garden or get out the shears and prune the rose bushes back yes a thousand things this beautiful april morning but i ’ ve decided to just lie here in this old hammock rocking like a lazy metronome and wait for the day lilies to open the sun is barely over the trees and already the sprinklers are out raining their immaculate bands of light over the lawns
things in the dark exist but are not realized perhaps with wings they wait for enacting light i start out as the sky descends to the visible spectrum and begins midmorning i find in a lab a blue magnetic fluid revolving in the stress of gauss the source of blue resides november nights up to the first snow derive from this seat of blue i spend a month reflecting at palomar my delicate fourteen tons i bring to bear on galaxies their lonely shine harbors on my dustless understanding curve i come to a mountain out of season the brass benchmark telling the height is under ice without witness without cease a blizzard pummels the summit 's face i reach the pole here at the axis the wobble and grind is audible my compass tries to point straight down it too deceived having achieved one absolute the source of north to find that south surrounds is all but it the humboldt current has my boat and its mile of line straight down now and then fishermen haul in the inexplicable along with seabream haddock squid i hook a coelacanth thought long extinct and brain it with an oar nose to the bottom i shove off from the hundred fathom curve slow footage of mud unreeling through my mind the miles of decline become my age hauled up someday by accident rupturing in the lost pressure my look will say how knowing feels living among the trilobites i learn you cross great lengths of time by stilling the waiting in yourself from scavengers i see how you can live off your own dead kind i gum the grit of a tidal flat and have no name a chance letter brings me home telling how i was found returned i sit like water in a jar light from a window passing through a slow rain of precipitate remembering the bottom
in the morning that comes up behind the roof in the shelter of the bridge in the corner of the cypresses that rise above the wall a rooster has crowed in the bell tower that rips the air with its shining point the notes ring out and already the morning din can be heard in the street the only street that goes from the river to the mountain dividing the woods one looks for some other words but the ideas are always just as dark just as simple and singularly painful there is hardly more than the eyes the open air the grass and the water in the distance with around every bend a well or a cool basin in the right-hand corner the last house with a larger head at the window the trees are extremely alive and all those familiar companions walk along the demolished wall that is crushed into the thorns with bursts of laughter above the ravine the din augments swells and if the car passes on the upper road one no longer knows if it is the flowers or the little bells that are chiming under the blazing sun when the landscape is on fire the traveler crosses the stream on a very narrow bridge before a dark hole where the trees line the water that falls asleep in the afternoon and against the trembling background of the woods the motionless man
a husband puts an afghan over the dead goat ’ s torso combs the knots out of her beard the goat smells chalk wonders when the riders will come in their wool pakols red from walnuts spurs chirring like castanets the buzkashi whips will grow damp in their mouths their rope belts slowly twisting in place she knows not to be devoured is a perfect sentiment because she has thoughts to gather faces to grow hunger this morning and no throat only the song in her teeth that goes on indefinitely as he saws off each hoof just above the ankle her knees bent for praying her head is axed her collar falls to the ground its circle unbroken she looks to see how deep is the pool of blood is a river of no one becoming her with salt in her heart she ’ ll stay good for days he ’ s been to her like her father he killed he ’ s been to her like the father he killed he turns her face to the window mountains oddly still in the milk broth of oblivion intercourse the sun drove a man in the ground like a stake

we wonder at our shifting capacities keep adding and striking skills from the bottoms of our résumés under constant revision like the inscriptions on tombs shared for generations unnervingly up to date made nervous by our shift in capabilities we write i visited a country where kittens lay dying under every bench in every gutter next to every cigarette butt one made me weep two made me worry three made me look away i visited a city with very few strays the first one i saw i adopted what could it mean —posted by sarah 6.18.06 hit “ publish ” and look away the new violence i visited a country where everything looked like home
glass was the street in tinsel peril tree and traveller stood filled was the air with merry venture hearty with boys the road shot the lithe sleds like shod vibrations emphacized and gone it is the past ’ s supreme italic makes the present mean
it began in a foyer of evenings the evenings left traces of glass in the trees a book and a footpath we followed under throat-pipes of birds we moved through a room of leaves thin streams of silver buried under our eyes a field of white clover buried under our eyes or a river we stopped at to watch the wind cross it recross it room into room you paused where once on a stoop we leaned back talking late into daylight the morning trees shook off twilight opening and closing our eyes auroras beyond groves and flora we followed a road dotted with polished brown bottles scoured furrows a wood emptied of trees it was enough to hollow us out the evenings left grasses half-wild at our feet branches with spaces for winds the earth changes the way we speak to each other has changed as for a long while we stood in a hall full of exits listening for a landscape beyond us

woven plaque basket with sunflower design hopi arizona before 1935 from an american indian basketry exhibit in portsmouth virginia the arizona highway sailed across the desert— a gray battleship drawing a black wake halting at the foot of the orange mesa unwilling to go around hopi men and women—brown and small and claylike —peered down from their tabletops at yellow tractors water trucks and white men blistered with sun—red as fire ants—towing sunscreen-slathered wives in glinting airstream trailers in caravans behind them elders knew these bia roads were bad medicine—knew too that young men listen less and less and these young hopi men needed work hence set aside their tools blocks of cottonwood root and half-finished koshari the clown katsinas then signed on with the department of transportation were hired to stab drills deep into the earth ’ s thick red flesh on first mesa drive giant sparking blades across the mesas ’ faces run the drill bits so deep they smoked bearding all the hopi men in white—bad spirits said the elders— the blades caught fire burned out—ma ’ saw is angry the elders said new blades were flown in by helicopter while elders dreamed their arms and legs had been cleaved off and their torsos were flung over the edge of a dinner table the young hopi men went back to work cutting the land into large chunks of rust nobody noticed at first—not the white workers not the indian workers—but in the mounds of dismantled mesa among the clods and piles of sand lay the small gray bowls of babies ’ skulls not until they climbed to the bottom did they see the silvered bones glinting from the freshly sliced dirt-and-rock wall— a mausoleum mosaic a sick tapestry the tiny remains roused from death ’ s dusty cradle cut in half cracked wrapped in time-tattered scraps of blankets let ’ s call it a day the white foreman said that night all the indian workers got sad-drunk—got sick —while elders sank to their kivas in prayer next morning as dawn festered on the horizon state workers scaled the mesas knocked at the doors of pueblos that had them hollered into those without them demanding the hopi men come back to work—then begging them— then buying them whiskey—begging again—finally sending their white wives up the dangerous trail etched into the steep sides to buy baskets from hopi wives and grandmothers as a sign of treaty when that didn ’ t work the state workers called the indians lazy sent their sunhat-wearing wives back up to buy more baskets— katsinas too—then called the hopis good-for-nothings before begging them back once more we ’ ll try again in the morning the foreman said but the indian workers never returned— the bias and dots calls to work went unanswered as the fevered hopis stayed huddled inside the small bones half-buried in the crevices of mesa— in the once-holy darkness of silent earth and always-night— smiled or sighed beneath the moonlight while white women in airstream trailers wrote letters home praising their husbands ’ patience describing the lazy savages such squalor in their stone and plaster homes—cobs of corn stacked floor to ceiling against crumbling walls—their devilish ceremonies and the barbaric way they buried their babies oh and those beautiful beautiful baskets
wrongheaded and obsequious on vacation unnerved by new surroundings i miss the bright feeling of belonging and the familiar patterns of my country its virginity and schizophrenia my several stolen bicycles
for my grandmother theresa frank some slow evenings when the light hangs late and stubborn in the sky gives itself up to darkness slowly and deliberately slow cloud after slow cloud slowness enters me like something familiar and it feels like going home it ’ s all there in the disappearing light all the evenings of slow sky and slow loving slow boats on sluggish bayous the thick-middled trees with the slow-sounding names—oak mimosa pecan magnolia the slow tree sap that sticks in your hair when you lie with the trees and the maple syrup and pancakes and grits the butter melting slowly into and down the sides like sweat between breasts of sloe-eyed strippers and the slow-throated blues that floats over the city like fog and the weeping the willows the cut onions the cayenne the slow-cooking beans with marrow-thick gravy and all the mint juleps drunk so slowly on all the slow southern porches the bourbon and sugar and mint going down warm and brown syrup and slow and all the ice cubes melting in all the iced teas all the slow-faced people sitting in all the slowly rocking rockers and the crabs and the shrimp and crawfish the hard shells slowly and deliberately and lovingly removed the delicate flesh slowly sucked out of heads and legs and tails and the slow lips that eat and drink and love and speak that slow luxurious language savoring each word like a long-missed lover and the slow-moving nuns the black habits dragging the swollen ground and the slow river that cradles it all and the chicory coffee that cuts through it all slow-boiled and black as dirt and the slow dreams and the slow-healing wounds and the slow smoke of it all slipping out ballooning into the sky—slow deliberate and magnificent
i am watching the movie twelve angry men because there is a character in it who reminds me of him he is the one who wants to go to the baseball game instead of decide on a man ’ s life he is the weak one the one afraid to reveal what he really feels the one for whom everything is a joke he is not henry fonda the tight-lipped moral one the man is despicable his weaknesses obvious to all as obvious as henry fonda ’ s goodness i watch the movie again and again loving the black and white of it soothed by the sound of my father ’ s voice the careless pronunciation the easy shrugging of the shoulders at every crucial question i sink lower into the dark arms of the sofa strange how comfortable the familiar is how we can even prefer it however terrifying
the damp had got its grip years ago but gone unnoticed the heads of the joists feathered slowly in the cavity wall and the room ’ s wet belly had begun to bow once we ’ d ripped the boards up it all came out the smell at first then the crumbling wood gone to seed all its muscles wasted you pottered back and to with tea soda bread eighty years shaking on a plastic tray one by one we looked up nodded then slipped under the floor we moved down there like fish in moonlight or divers round an old ship

all afternoon i walk behind the mower imagining though paradoxically that even though the grass is getting lower what i have cut is like a rising sea the parts i haven ’ t cut with every pass resemble real geography a map a shrinking island continent of grass where shoreline vanishes with every lap at last the noise and smell of gasoline dispel my dream what sea peninsulas they were the lands my inner child had seen their little yucatáns and floridas but when i ’ m finished and yard goes back to lawn i can ’ t help thinking that a world is gone

the king asks “ tell me what is the highest meaning of the holiest truths ” the seer answers “ emptiness without holiness. ” the king is a restless seeker the seer is a ruler and thief i am seriously watching how trees are always missing some leaves they sweep the air looking for them nothing distracts them nothing where leaves are missing between the branches beautiful sun porches which disappear when the tree reaches them “ who are you ” the king asks “ it is not like that ” the seer says the seer leaves the king alone in his throne room and starts walking to china kicking up gravel hurrying to find the next king on the road between country houses he stops to listen to trees digging the air for crickets he wonders whether the king is mad now like the trees or dancing and recounting the story without an end

i ’ m watching football which is odd as i hate football in a hyperbolic and clinically revealing way but i hate bill parcells more because he is the illuminated manuscript of cruel successful men those with the slitty eyes of ancient reptiles who wear their smugness like a tight white turtleneck and revel in their lack of empathy for any living thing so i ’ m watching football staying up late to watch football hoping to witness as i think of it the humiliation of the tuna as he is called which is rightly parcells ’ s first time back in the meadowlands since taking up with the cowboys who are as we all know thugs even by the nfl ’ s standards the reasons i hate football are clear and complicated and were born as i was in nebraska where football is to life what sleep deprivation is to amnesty international that is the best researched and most effective method of breaking a soul yes there ’ s the glorification of violence the weird nexus knitting the homo both phobic and erotic but also and worse my parents in 1971 drunk as australian parrots in a bottlebush screeching we ’ re 1 we ’ re 1 when the huskers finally clinched the orange bowl the two of them bouncing up and down crazily on the couch their index fingers jutting holes through the ubiquitous trail of smoke rings that was the weather in our house until the whole deranged mess that was them my parents the couch their lit cigarettes flipped over backward onto my brother and me my husband thinks that ’ s a funny story and in an effort to be a “ good sport ” i say i think it is too which leads me to recall the three chihuahuas who ’ ve spent the fullness of their agitated lives penned in the back of my neighbor ’ s yard today they barked continuously for 12 minutes i timed it as the ups guy made his daily round they bark so piercingly they tremble with such exquisite outrage that i ’ ve begun to root for them though it ’ s fashionable to hate them and increasingly dark threats against their tiny persons move between the houses on our block but isn ’ t that what ’ s wrong with this version of america the jittering small-skulled inbred-by-no-choice- of-their-own are despised and bill parcells— the truth is he ’ ll win this game i know it and you know it and sadly did it ever seem there was another possible outcome it ’ s a small deposit but i ’ m putting my faith in reincarnation i need to believe in the sweetness of one righteous image in bill parcells trapped in the body of a teacup poodle as any despised thing forced to yap away his next life staked to a clothesline pole or doing hard time on a rich old matron ’ s lap dyed lilac to match her outfit i want to live there someday across that street and listen to him yap yap yap
i have been taught never to brag but now i can not help it i keep a beautiful garden all abundance indiscriminate pulling itself from the stubborn earth does it offend you to watch me working in it touching my hands to the greening tips or tearing the yellow stalks back so wild the living and the dead both snap off in my hands the neighbor with his stuttering fingers the neighbor with his broken love each comes up my drive to receive his pitying accustomed consolations watches me work in silence awhile rises in anger walks back does it offend them to watch me not mourning with them but working fitfully fruitlessly working the way the bees work which is to say by instinct alone which looks like pleasure i can stand for hours among the sweet narcissus silent as a point of bone i can wait longer than sadness i can wait longer than your grief it is such a small thing to be proud of a garden today there were scrub jays quail a woodpecker knocking at the white- and-black shapes of trees and someone ’ s lost rabbit scratching under the barberry is it indiscriminate should it shrink back wither and expurgate should i too not be loved it is only a little time a little space why not watch the grasses take up their colors in a rush like a stream of kerosene being lit if i could not have made this garden beautiful i wouldn ’ t understand your suffering nor care for each the same inflamed way i would have to stay only like the bees beyond consciousness beyond self-reproach fingers dug down hard into stone and growing nothing there is no end to ego with its museum of disappointments i want to take my neighbors into the garden and show them here is consolation here is your pity look how much seed it drops around the sparrows as they fight it lives alongside their misery it glows each evening with a violent light
and then i thought can i have more of this would it be possible for every day to be a greater awakening more light more light your face on the pillow with the sleep creases rudely fragmenting it hair so stiff from paint and sheet rock it feels like the dirty short hank of mane i used to grab on dandy ’ s neck before he hauled me up and forward white flanks flecked green with shit and the satin of his dander the livingness the warmth of all that blood just under the skin and in the long thick muscle of the neck— he was smarter than most of the children i went to school with he knew how to stand with just the crescent of his hoof along a boot toe and press incrementally his whole weight down the pain so surprising when it came its iron intention sheathed in stealth the decisive sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof pinned one ’ s foot completely to the ground we ’ d have to beat and beat him with a brush to push him off that hot insistence with its large horse eye trained deliberately on us to watch— like us he knew how to announce through violence how he didn ’ t hunger didn ’ t want despite our practiced ministrations too young not to try to empathize with this cunning this thing that was and was not human we must respect for itself and not our imagination of it i loved him because i could not love him anymore in the ways i ’ d taught myself watching the slim bodies of teenagers guide their geldings in figure eights around the ring as if they were one body one fluid motion of electric understanding i would never feel working its way through fingers to the bit this thing had a name a need a personality it possessed an indifference that gave me logic and a measure i too might stop wanting the hand placed on back or shoulder and never feel the desired response i loved the horse for the pain it could imagine and inflict on me the sudden jerking of head away from halter the tentative nose inspecting first before it might decide to relent and eat i loved what was not slave or instinct that when you turn to me it is a choice it is always a choice to imagine pleasure might be blended one warmth bleeding into another as the future bleeds into the past more light more light your hand against my shoulder the image of the one who taught me disobedience is the first right of being alive
compiling this landmark anthology of poetry in english about dogs and musical instruments is like swimming through bricks to date i have only “ on the death of mrs. mctuesday ’ s pug killed by a falling piano ” a somewhat obvious choice true an aeolian harp whispers alluringly in the background of the anonymous sonnet “ the huntsman ’ s hound ” but beyond that — silence i should resist this degrading donkey-work in favor of my own writing wherein contentment surely lies but a. smith stares smugly from the reverse of the twenty pound note and when my bank manager guffaws small particles of saliva stream like a meteor shower through the infinity of dark space between his world and mine
to the metropolitan police force london the asylum gates are locked and chained but undone by wandering thoughts and the close study of maps so from san francisco patron city of tramps i scribble this note having overshot gloucester by several million strides having walked on water city of sad foghorns and clapboard ziggurats of snakes-and-ladders streets and cadged cigarettes city of pelicans fish bones and flaking paint of underfoot cable-car wires strained to breaking point ... i eat little — a beard of grass a pinch of oats — let the salt-tide scour and purge me inside and out but my mind still phosphoresces with lightning strikes and i straddle each earthquake one foot either side of the fault line rocking the world ’ s seesaw at dusk the golden gate bridge is heaven ’ s seashore i watch boats heading home with the day ’ s catch or ferrying souls to glittering alcatraz or i face west and let the pacific slip in bloodshot glory over the planet ’ s lip sense the waterfall at the end of the journey i am ever your countryman ivor gurney
when i read about the garden designed to bloom only white flowers i think about the spanish friar who saw one of my grandmothers two hundred years removed and fucked her if you look at the word colony far enough you see it traveling back to the latin of inhabit till and cultivate words that would have meant something to the friar walking among the village girls as though in a field of flowers knowing that fucking was one way of having a foreign policy as i write this there ’ s snow falling which means that every angry thought is as short-lived as a match the night is its own white garden snow on the fence snow on the tree stump snow on the azalea bushes their leaves hanging down like green bats from the branches i know it ’ s not fair to see qualities of injustice in the aesthetics of a garden but somewhere between what the eye sees and what the mind thinks is the world landscapes mangled into sentences one color read into rage when the neighbors complained the roots of our cypress were buckling their lot my landlord cut the tree down i didn ’ t know a living thing three stories high could be so silent until it was gone suddenly that sky suddenly all the light in the windows as though every sheet of glass was having a migraine when i think about that grandmother whose name i don ’ t even know i think of what it would mean to make a garden that blooms black peonies and gladiolas of deepest purple tulips like ravens or a garden that doesn ’ t bloom at all rocks poised on clean gravel when the snow stops i walk to see the quiet that has colonized everything the main street is asleep except for the bus that goes by bright as a cruise ship there are sheet cakes of snow on top of cars in front of houses each lawn is as clean as paper except where the first cat or raccoon has walked across each track like a barbed-wire sash on a white gown

a huge purple door washed up in the bay overnight its paintwork blistered and peeled from weeks at sea the town storyteller wasted no time in getting to work the beguiling eldest girl of a proud bankrupt farmer had slammed that door in the face of a freemason ’ s son who in turn had bulldozed both farm and family over the cliff except for the girl who lived now by the light and heat of a driftwood fire on a beach there was some plan to use the door as a jetty or landing-stage but it was all bullshit the usual idle talk that ’ s when he left and never returned him i won ’ t name — not known for his big ideas or carpentry skills a famous non-swimmer but last seen sailing out riding the current and rounding the point in a small boat with tell-tale flashes of almost certainly purple paint

the butcher ’ s apprentice 1911–1914 by august sander the high white collar and the bowler hat the black coat of respectability the starched cuff and the brandished cigarette are what he has decided we will see though in the closet hangs an apron flecked with bits of brain beside the rubber boots stained brown from wading through the bloody slick that by the end of every workday coats the killing floor he stands on he declines to illustrate as in a children ’ s book the work he does although it will define him every time the photograph he took is shown and captioned for posterity — even as his proud eyes and carriage say that what he is is not what he would be in a just world where no one had to slay

one sunday morning instead of studying the illiad i escaped with bino to florence to see what miracles the aviator manissero would perform whether he would demonstrate the art of daedalus or the folly of icarus we found the whole city festooned with banners on which was written today we fly they were everywhere via cerretani via cavour via calzaioli along the embankments there was even one stretched across the arno with an enormous red today we fly reflected in the yellow water like the famous in hoc signo vinces of ponte milvio we almost expected that florence itself would lift off with its towers its statues its red roofs with its cathedral 's nodding cupola rising slowly through the clouds like a balloon every window doorway and marketplace was crammed with upturned faces scanning the sky for some sign of the direction the wind might take and whether there would come with it the smell of rain we were most afraid of the wind from bologna proud enemy to the north almost as bad would have been the wind from the south from empoli called the scirocco or petrarch 's east wind from arezzo with its grecian-accented gusts but even a soft westerly breeze from pistoia— even that sweet breath from the ballads of cino full of dolce stil novo— would have spelled disaster luckily the sky that sunday was clear and the air was still the leaves on the trees around the parade ground stood at ease and the outlines of the hills were crisp sharply etched in the crystalline air just wait today we really will fly said bino with a smile for overnight today we fly had become a catchphrase fit for every occasion for a straw hat rolling along the pavement for a parasol blown around the corner for a dress tangled up between the knees or blown flapping like a flag around rounded hips it was the happy time of the first aeroplanes before the war when it was fashionable for women to wear enormous hairdos as wide as their dresses were narrow and those gigantic wings of hair which were the objects of so many of our teenage jokes have remained braided together in my heart with the fluttering today we fly maliciously good-natured mementos of my adolescence we hurried over the parade grounds and there was manissero crouched in the cockpit of his machine a contraption of woven reeds and papery cloth with a motor so small it made you think a horsefly was pinned to the frame behind his shoulders the crowd had assembled holding its breath waiting for the miracle to happen when suddenly the leaves began to tremble and the blades of grass of nod a few tiny white clouds sprouted like windowsills on monte morello and the women 's wings of hair began to come untucked from their padded nests of false braids manissero jumped out of his cockpit at the first sign of this unfortunate breeze waved amicably to the crowd with a gloved hand and yanked off his leather helmet while a banner was unfurled above the grandstands because of unsettled weather today we will not fly it was hard to imagine anything more settled than the weather that day a magnificent paradisiacal sunday in spring but all it took was this delicate breeze this perfumed zephyr from pistoia to spoil everything we returned to prato with heavy hearts and i took up my study of the abandoned illiad quiet and discouraged thursday morning the rumor began to spread that the following sunday if the weather was favorable manissero would attempt to fly from florence to prato and back thirty kilometers round trip by saturday via magnolfi the corso via del'oche via firenzuola—all the streets of prato were crisscrossed with white banners carrying those fateful words today we fly by noon sunday rivers of people from the surrounding the countryside were flooding into the city through its five gates and by three o'clock the cathedral square was awash with a restless and noisy crowd pale perspiring noses in the air i stood among them with my classmates all of us impatient barely kept in check by the stern gaze of our principal and the softer reprimands of the teachers we began to hear a new word velivolo dancing above the buzz of the crowd but that name for aeroplane recently coined by d'annunzio seemed too delicate for the gaping mouths of dumbstruck farmers it was still fresh still smelled of varnish and was as sweet and sharp in the mouth as mint candy velivolo suddenly a white wing appeared in the blue sky and the reed-and-paper bird grew larger came closer hovered over the cathedral square a cry only one but from a thousand throats a cry more of fear than joy then sudden silence bursting with anguish manissero was perhaps two hundred meters above our heads and it seemed miraculous miraculous not just because he was flying but because he was flying over prato in the virgin sky of prato which only the kites of children had dared to caress until today as long as the flying was over florence things were fine certain facts in florence are understandable are legitimate and fit within in the logic of history but over prato over prato where for centuries now nothing miraculous had happened not on the ground and not in the sky especially not in the sky over prato where it seemed that miracles had become impossible caught as we were between the historic pride of florence and the ancient jealousy of pistoia sacrificed reduced to poor relations robbed not only of everything that we had which would have been bad enough but of everything we might have wanted to have yet here was manissero flying in our sky in the neglected sky of prato and he was flying or so it seemed better than he might have flown in the sky of florence better than in any other sky in tuscany after a moment though the suspicion began to grow that he might fly as far as pistoia everyone held their breath balanced on one foot hearts stopped between beats the treacherous sky of pistoia some us took out our keys ready to rattle them against such a betrayal the rest of us set our lips to whistle in defiance but manissero veered to the right and after a wide turn over prato he headed back toward florence the city detonated with joy i lost myself in the crowd beyond thought proud citizen of prato to my bones it would n't be too much to say that all of us that day felt we held a piece of sky in our hands that night in my dreams the achaean army assembling beneath the walls of troy came to a halt astonished at what lay before them stretching from tower to tower immense white banners on which great red letters spelled out today we fly and then troy the city of priam— which from a distance resembled nothing more than prato— detached itself gently from the earth hovered with its banners snapping in the breeze and drifted away into the clear sky swinging gently from side to side maddened achilles ran along below commanding stop stop and from the buzz of his accent you might have thought he was from pistoia beloved priam from the top of the trojan gates answered sweetly too late too late and his voice had all soft accents of prato taking flight
china is made of earth of sun-dried mud in this part of china everything is made from the earth the houses the walls around cities and villages the tombs scattered over the countryside even the people there are hills below that appear to be piles of mud set out to dry in the sun naked without a single tree or bush they crowd around the landscape like the coils of bulging intestines tossed on the ground outside butchers shops slowly unraveling sometimes we fly so low that we almost touch them and then i notice that the wind has brushed some kind of pattern into the earth a mysterious alphabet written in the mud struggling to communicate something precise but there is not a single animal or human being in the yellow desert below not a single village suddenly we are landing xian the geographic center of china where chinese civilization was born in the cradle of the yellow river in front of the terminal three children are playing with a lump of earth they are bundled up in jackets and brightly printed cotton trousers i join them in their game until a young woman comes out of the terminal to call me in for dinner one of the children grabs me by my overcoat to keep me from leaving so do the other two clinging to me asking me not to go the young woman comes out again and yells at them to stop they let go disappointed one of them calls to me as i turn away come back soon we eat quickly and then prepare to take off for lanchow my three new friends wave goodbye to me the littlest one gives me a present a pebble a precious gift in this part of china there are no stones you have to go to karelia to find stone very far north or to the caucasus or to southern siberia along the slopes of the pamir slanting toward the steppes of central asia i put the pebble in my pocket to take back home to show what a precious gift i was given by a little chinese girl a pebble from the cradle of chinese civilization a civilization made of earth a civilization without bones without a skeleton for support a civilization of assembled customs which suddenly unravel dissolving into thousands of separate gestures thousands of calligraphic icons thousands of smells colors flavors thousands of different shades and then just as suddenly they solidify again into tradition memory habit it is this absence of stone of solid durable material which makes china such an exquisite thing everything is reflected an unimaginable number of movements of patterns thoughts images of which we see the copies in immense numbers but never the originals the originals were destroyed long ago here are the four elements out of which china is made earth wood porcelain silk the most durable of these is silk i should add a fifth element poetry which is the most durable of all

a found poem composed entirely of e-mails from various high school students if i were to ask you a question about your book and sum it up into one word it would be why i think i like walt whitman better than you i just don't get literature but for a fast hour and a half read your book takes the cake i like how you organized the lines in that one poem to represent a growing twisting bonsai tree are you going to get a rude reaction when you meet that one guy in that one poem i guess you never know you are very young to be a poet i also like how your poems take up an entire page it makes our reading assignment go faster in class we spend so much time dissecting your poems and then deeply analyzing them i think i like walt whitman better than you but don ’ t take offense—you are very good too you are young you are young and pure and really just want to have a good time thank you we have taken a debate and you are a far better poet than walt whitman and i loved how your poems were easy to read and understand hello my name is alicia we read you book and i just loved it we also read walt whitman ’ s leaves of grass there was no competition there i liked your book a whole lot better it was an easy read but poetry is not my favorite type of literature sometimes i am offered drinks and guys try to talk to me but i too just brush it off and keep dancing every once and a while the creepy mean guys try to offer you things and then they say something what would you do lastly i was wondering if you ever wrote a poem that really didn ’ t have a deeper meaning but everyone still tried to give it one anyways walt whitman is better than you

after alfred stieglitz not so much the missing of things but the nostalgia of colors their music the ordinary revelation of a family ’ s life caught in the flop and dance a jig if you will of their layers outer and inner skins the secret things so close to the body the taste the salt and sweet of blood and shit and piss and then rinsed and scrubbed leaving beneath the astringent scent of soap a musky marker of self for strays to smell or imagine as they walk past the parade of the living on taut lines propped by poles with nails for a hook above the startling green of grass and hedge the barefaced concrete steps the sky inscrutable as a wall this is what one carries as a kind of sweetness — the labor of brown hands elbow-deep in suds the rituals of cleansing the humility of a darning or a frayed crotch the dignity of cleanliness the democracy of truth the way we lived our lives in the open

i. although tía miriam boasted she discovered at least half a dozen uses for peanut butter— topping for guava shells in syrup butter substitute for cuban toast hair conditioner and relaxer— mamá never knew what to make of the monthly five-pound jars handed out by the immigration department until my friend jeff mentioned jelly ii there was always pork though for every birthday and wedding whole ones on christmas and new year ’ s eve even on thanksgiving day—pork fried broiled or crispy skin roasted— as well as cauldrons of black beans fried plantain chips and yuca con mojito these items required a special visit to antonio ’ s mercado on the corner of eighth street where men in guayaberas stood in senate blaming kennedy for everything— “ ese hijo de puta ” the bile of cuban coffee and cigar residue filling the creases of their wrinkled lips clinging to one another ’ s lies of lost wealth ashamed and empty as hollow trees iii by seven i had grown suspicious—we were still here overheard conversations about returning had grown wistful and less frequent i spoke english my parents didn ’ t we didn ’ t live in a two-story house with a maid or a wood-panel station wagon nor vacation camping in colorado none of the girls had hair of gold none of my brothers or cousins were named greg peter or marcia we were not the brady bunch none of the black and white characters on donna reed or on the dick van dyke show were named guadalupe lázaro or mercedes patty duke ’ s family wasn ’ t like us either— they didn ’ t have pork on thanksgiving they ate turkey with cranberry sauce they didn ’ t have yuca they had yams like the dittos of pilgrims i colored in class iv a week before thanksgiving i explained to my abuelita about the indians and the mayflower how lincoln set the slaves free i explained to my parents about the purple mountain ’ s majesty “ one if by land two if by sea ” the cherry tree the tea party the amber waves of grain the “ masses yearning to be free ” liberty and justice for all until finally they agreed this thanksgiving we would have turkey as well as pork v. abuelita prepared the poor fowl as if committing an act of treason faking her enthusiasm for my sake mamá set a frozen pumpkin pie in the oven and prepared candied yams following instructions i translated from the marshmallow bag the table was arrayed with gladiolas the plattered turkey loomed at the center on plastic silver from woolworth ’ s everyone sat in green velvet chairs we had upholstered with clear vinyl except tío carlos and toti seated in the folding chairs from the salvation army i uttered a bilingual blessing and the turkey was passed around like a game of russian roulette “ dry ” tío berto complained and proceeded to drown the lean slices with pork fat drippings and cranberry jelly— “ esa mierda roja ” he called it faces fell when mamá presented her ochre pie— pumpkin was a home remedy for ulcers not a dessert tía maría made three rounds of cuban coffee then abuelo and pepe cleared the living room furniture put on a celia cruz lp and the entire family began to merengue over the linoleum of our apartment sweating rum and coffee until they remembered— it was 1970 and 46 degrees— in américa after repositioning the furniture an appropriate darkness filled the room tío berto was the last to leave
not a study or a den but el florida as my mother called it a pretty name for the room with the prettiest view of the lipstick-red hibiscus puckered up against the windows the tepid breeze laden with the brown-sugar scent of loquats drifting in from the yard not a sunroom but where the sun both rose and set all day the shadows of banana trees fan-dancing across the floor and if it rained it rained the loudest like marbles plunking across the roof under constant threat of coconuts ready to fall from the sky not a sitting room but el florida where i sat alone for hours with butterflies frozen on the polyester curtains and faces of lladró figurines sad angels clowns and princesses with eyes glazed blue and gray gazing from behind the glass doors of the wall cabinet not a tv room but where i watched creature feature as a boy clinging to my brother safe from vampires in the same sofa where i fell in love with clint eastwood and my abuelo watching westerns or pitying women crying in telenovelas with my abuela not a family room but the room where my father twirled his hair while listening to eight-tracks of elvis read nietzsche and kant a few months before he died where my mother learned to dance alone as she swept and i learned salsa pressed against my tía julia ’ s enormous breasts at the edge of the city in the company of crickets beside the empty clothesline telephone wires and the moon tonight my life is an old friend sitting with me not in the living room but in the light of el florida as quiet and necessary as any star shining above it

oh de wars and de scrapes and de sprees am done—sprees am done de foe am beat de turks am drowned—turks am drowned all safe and sounds to our wives we come —otello by t. d. rice dreams may come from the enemy— from the business of the past day— from a disordered body— from moral evil— from god through the medium of the angels and departed saints as forewarnings to stir up and prepare the mind for the scenes ahead i fell into a slumber and in it i dreamed that two devils entered the room each with a chain in his hand they laid hold on me the one at my head the other at my feet and bound me fast and breaking out the window carried me a distance from the house and laid me on a spot of ice and while the weaker devil flew off in flames of fire the stronger one set out to carry me down to hell i put my hands together and said lord i submit to go and preach thy gospel only grant my peaceful hours to return and open the door here i received the solemn news of the death of our only child the vibration of the earth shook down the trees thousands of willows were swept off like a pipe stem about waist high and the swamps became high ground and high land became low ground and two islands in the river were so shaken washed away and sunk as not to be found from this i infer some trouble is at hand but the film was already starting— the sounds came in waves higher and higher at the top of it someone screaming— now what you call your great disappointment i call the great awakeneing— when i heard though not always in these old forgotten words i remember the first of three visions— yet if you tell me they are only my dear dead returning i would not disbelieve you 2. it is an odd sort of fortune to have lived an adventurous life in my disgust i left school and devoted all my blighted spirit to minstrelsy i had no natural aptness for the banjo but for dancing— such a remarkable gift few ever saw the first part of our performances we gave with white faces and by practicing to knock spin and toss the tambourine back in my room i was now the “ scotch girl ” in plaid petticoats besides my highland fling i took the principal lady parts in the negro ballets for a lad i danced “ lucy long ” so admirably a planter in one of the southern states insisted on purchasing me until the door-tender kicked that planter down the stairs old ephraim was one of the most comical specimens of the negro species the blackest face largest mouth whitest teeth what could he do why he could fetch water black our boots take care of our baggage my father said of howie gray who worked beside him every day at the south station po and put both his sons through college “ he ’ s not an uppity negro. ” my father meant that as a compliment there were tears in his eyes when howie gray died 3. every man his own radio— it hath been thought that the dying speeches of such as have been executed among us might be of singular use to correct the crimes wherein too many do live billington disregarding the commotion he was causing and the certainty of apprehension reloaded and stalked his enemy she concealed her crime until the time of her delivery and then being delivered alone by her self in a dark room she murdered the harmless and helpless infant foster didn ’ t say a word he just picked up a steal boomer and smashed pikin over the head with it i went forth to be delivered in the field and dropping my child by the side of a little pond whether alive or stillborn i can not tell i covered it over with dirt and snow and speedily returned home he struck the helpless kling again and again mr. spooner strove to speak when down brooks took him by the throat and partly strangled him ross and buchanan came out ross took mr. spooner ’ s watch and gave it to buchanan brooks and ross took him up and put him in the well head first before they carried him away i buchanan pulled off his shoes eight streaks of splattered blood eight murderous strokes of an axe or knife was found by a person with a dog crossing the fields in a piece of woods a little distance from brandywine to the turk ’ s head two dead infants now what you call your great awakening i call much ado i call the big sleep— but when did i become someone on whom everything is lost like the dream i lifted from my father like a band-aid— where i checked hats that instantly embarrassingly disappeared— my earnest offers to return the 1.00 gratuity raining down on dead ears— i thought i was boyish it availed me nothing
bartender make it straight and make it two— one for the you in me and the me in you now let us put our heads together one is half enough for malice sense or fun i know bartender yes i know when the law should wag its tail or rip with fang and claw when pilate washed his hands that neat event set for us judges a caesarean precedent what i shall tell you now as man is man you ’ ll find in neither bible nor koran it happened after my return from france at the bar in tony ’ s lady of romance we boys drank pros and cons sang dixie and then the bar a sahara we pledged to meet again but lo on the bar there stood in naked scorn the goddess justice like september morn who blindfolds justice on the courthouse roof while the lawyers weave the sleight-of-hand of proof i listened bartender with my heart and head as the goddess justice unbandaged her eyes and said “ to make the world safe for democracy you lost a leg in flanders fields—oui oui to gain the judge ’ s seat you twined the noose that swung the negro higher than a goose. ” bartender who has dotted every i crossed every t put legs on every y therefore i challenged her “ lay on macduff and damned be him who first cries ‘ hold enough ’ ” the boys guffawed and justice began to laugh like a maniac on a broken phonograph bartender make it straight and make it three— one for the negro one for you and me
down in the shipyard day and night the galahads of the dock hard as the sinews of basin rock build an ocean cosmopolite the rivets stab and the hammers bite into the beams and plates of steel of the diesel heart and the belly keel we the workers of the world strike catholic notes on woods and irons wring from brassy throats epics of industry day and night the diapason puts the bent-winged gulls to flight and shakes the harbor and quakes the ground and leaps at the suns like prometheus bound our matrix shapes our citizen of the world to cross the churning mountains of the sea nor fashions a canoe to sail a lake in cool felicity
i watch a squirrel get run over by a car on my walk to work she is lying dead in the street and still has an acorn in her little hands i am amazed at how she is able to hold on to her acorn after being tumbled like that after bouncing so high off the street i walk over to the squirrel and see that her face is blown to bits and looks like uncased sausage spilling onto the asphalt but that acorn is still so tight in her hands i pick her up by her tail take off my dress shirt and swaddle her in it then put her in my bag i know right where she is as i walk into work everybody looking at me everybody asking me about my shirtlessness the world is as steady as if it were sewn into the skin of the universe
their long stares mark them apart eyes gone to sea-colors gray foam-flecked and black in the undertow blue as the blue banners of the mackerel whipping west on land they are smoke-walkers where each stone is a standing stone every circle a stone circle they would be rumor if they could in this frozen landscape like a stopped sea from the great stone keels of callanish to the walls of dunnottar and drum they would be less even than rumor to be ocean-stealers to never throw a shadow — to dream the blank horizon and dread the sight of land the drink storms through these men uncompasses them till they ’ re all at sea again their houses heeled over in the sand each ruin now a cairn for kites and down by the quay past empty pots unmended nets and boats this tiny bar where men sleep upright in their own element as seals
gain — a bevel cut into plank ends in traditional lapstrake boat construction that allows otherwise lapped planks to lay flush at stem and transom there ’ s the paring chisel ’ s purpose in the steamed cedar strake its long warp laid strong against the bench whose pocked surface is the book of what has already been made or marred in learning ’ s wake — clamped now in the jaws one is waiting for its match for the chisel to elaborate the pencil ’ s scribed hypothesis under which lies another path through a tilting eye the curving bevel ’ s made the chisel rolling back tight scrolls of thinnest grain what bright sleeves begin to fleece the floor there is a lack given to the wood some short song cut loose from the lignin ’ s name that a longer more buoyant melody be made
the steam box is used for bending frames and planks in traditional boatbuilding with a match i became a man who summoned diesel from the yellow caverns of a ten-gallon jug called the flame now hissing out the hose at the small house of water that rusted drum from which travels an excruciating wetness — this is what makes the body otherwise what makes it sing to take that which has decided on a shape and bend without breaking the lengthening fibers to give the straight thing curve to make of the tree a song grown long in a linseed skin the slick hot strake waiting to become parcel of the round world again
heart oh heart i sit here writing your name on pieces of paper folded hidden misplaced found again there is the element of saying and there is the element of making one needn ’ t choose i am singing the dream out from the ice asking it to carry me like a horse or a river down and away this day here in paned-glass sun the young waitress shaking out her apron and retying it flat across her stomach— a bit of vanity—her hair swept off her neck crash of a milk bottle on the granite counter cream spread in a mild pool toward the rim and the roots of habit and longing briefly seized by the mind so noisy here the sound echoes out of years brought to this showing forth unrehearsed it seems we wake and find ourselves repeating embodying the ancient gestures by which we recognize ourselves completed not one of us could be born and invent life—it must show through us— the arm flung in the air the coffee poured out and down the street someone hurrying by head down against the wind and a man and a woman come to an old grief carved in them carved into them —the old way of water wearing rock— by law and the hatred between them is equal to the hope neither will release each wants to be whole to embody all of time when nothing in this world is whole and this is by law when my father said bitterly to my mother you have changed he meant without meaning to say how she had changed him a man holds his head down against the wind yet the wind fills him with the dust of temples the breath of the dead the dream of the light inside the branches— a gleam of wet glimmer that is a bud the leaf within the bud the photographer comes inside and closes the lens of his camera then he is the lens then my eye is the light this is the element of saying the young waitress flings a paper cup behind her into the trash can that is a saying the cream swirled into the coffee the sugar dissolving disembodied and the body of the manager disappears swallowed into a doorway the element of making is slow uncertain as a temple a falling forward stitching back like a stone wall like the panes in an arched window like a repetition chosen beyond necessity yet somehow we have seen all this before— the girl in the fur hat speaking syrup into a phone the falseness of her charm is an ancient imposter familiar and therefore true a door is opened and falls closed suddenly at every table someone looks down and is reading— books newspapers calendars reading tea leaves reading bones a woman in a periwinkle jacket i am reading her shoulders as the day introspects in dream the passive construction and the past perfect tense prevail she was being pushed on a swing the woman with many television credits gazes out the window heavy with years forgetting herself forgetting sorrow the false husband the crippled child the old plots forgetting and it is suddenly lovely as free as something read or dreamed the young waitress with sun on her face—her unblemished face—looks up from the middle of eternity her desire immaculate in the moment when a word is beautiful above all others—your name— when a woman appears as a bird of prey and we turn away hoping not to be recognized—oh heart — when the light on the branches flares in a window with no sky this is old story reading us these are springs from words laid down before and ahead of us and in the moment we are making an answer

for phil jackson the gym opened out before us like a vast arena the bleached floorboards yawned toward a vanishing point staggered seats high as the mayan temple i once saw devoured by vines each of us was eaten up inside — all citizens of lost and unmapped cities frank hugged the pimply ball over his belly like an unborn child claire dressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes david ’ s gaze was an emperor ’ s surveying a desiccated battlefield since he viewed everything that way we all saw him the same the psych techs in cloroxed white were giant angels who set us running drills at which we sucked the zones we set out to defend were watery at every edge we missed close chest passes easy combos our metronomes run different tempos john proclaimed then claire started seeing dashes stutter through the air behind the ball then speed lines on our backs and then her own head went wobbly as a spinning egg she ’ d once tracked planetary orbits for nasa and now sat sidelined by her eyes ’ projections only bill had game catatonic bill whose normal talent was to schlub days in a tub chair — his pudding face scarred with chicken pox — using his hand for an ashtray belly for an armrest now all that peeled away and he emerged clean as an egg he was a lithe and licorice boy eeling past all comers each shot sheer net he faked both ways went left beneath the orange rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that i could barely sludge through he scored beyond what even claire could count then he bent panting hands on knees as the orderlies held out water cups and the rest of us reached to pat his back or slap his sweaty hand no one minding about the stench or his breath like old pennies then as quick as that he went inside his head some inner winch did reel him back from the front of his face bones where he ’ d been ablaze he went back and back into that shadowed stare lucky we were to breathe his air breath is god ’ s intent to keep us living he was the self i ’ d come in wanting to kill and i left him there

dusty and treeless the street sloped beneath us somewhere a hammer made thunderclaps forging the night-sky then the children seeing us dashed from the moorish houses vigorously shouting vying for position while the bravest in worn underpants and plastic sandals climbed a high crater-like wall and plunged with murderous cries into the roman pool where blue-lipped fish waited ah those glorious soaked heads spiked like palm fronds seeing one in our group clutch her purse— repelled by the wet black princes who shivered in circles of yellow mud and begged from us— i felt ashamed in the brief african twilight a canary chirped something shrewdly about avarice far off in the little neighborhood where i grew—with neat cement walkways and crab-apple blossoms— money ran through the fingers of our house with nothing much to record its loss but unhappiness one of us ironing servilely one of us sobbing in a bedroom one of us sleeping on a rifle one of us seizing another by the hair demanding the animal-like submission we thought was love sunday evening mother is wearing a big cotton shift and tweezing her eyebrows her head is a thicket of hairpins in the round hand-mirror that parodies her face the world looks greater than it is i am next to bathe in the water of the poor earth reused by each of us in order of birth gray with sodium and grit it covers me like a black robe and yet i feel exalted soon the violent rain like wet sahara sand would fall scrubbing the hot labyrinthine corridors of shuttered houses and aimless dogs where the sparse life is purgative and inexhaustible where little pilfering hands moved freely in and out of my trouser pockets though there were no diamonds except those the eyes mined

our eye goes past the hieroglyphic tree to the swimmer carving a wake in the water and almost to the railroad bridge from which the swimmer might have dived then as though come to the end of its tether our gaze returns pulling toward the blemish on the surface of the print an l-shaped chemical dribble it sabotages the scene ’ s transparence and siphons off its easy appeal at the same time the blemish joins together the realms of seer and swimmer in our experience of plunging into and out of the image
against the backdark bright riband flickers of heat lightning nearer hills begin to show to come clear as a hard detached and glimmering brim against light lifting there and here pitched over the braided arroyo choked with debris a tent its wan cakey road-rur color on the front stake two green dragonflies riding each other pause look cries the boy running the father behind him running too— and the canyon opening out in front of them its magisterial consequence cramming vertiginous air down its throat— to snatch him from the scarp

the night john henry is born an ax of lightning splits the sky and a hammer of thunder pounds the earth and the eagles and panthers cry john henry—he says to his ma and pa “ get a gallon of barleycorn i want to start right like a he-man child the night that i am born ” says “ i want some ham hocks ribs and jowls a pot of cabbage and greens some hoecakes jam and buttermilk a platter of pork and beans ” john henry ’ s ma—she wrings her hands and his pa—he scratches his head john henry—he curses in giraffe-tall words flops over and kicks down the bed he ’ s burning mad like a bear on fire— so he tears to the riverside as he stoops to drink old man river gets scared and runs upstream to hide some say he was born in georgia—o lord some say in alabam but it ’ s writ on the rock at the big bend tunnel “ lousyana was my home so scram ”

homo sapiens is the only species to suffer psychological exile —e o. wilson i returned to a stand of pines bone-thin phalanx flanking the roadside tangle of understory—a dialectic of dark and light—and magnolias blossoming like afterthought each flower a surrender white flags draped among the branches i returned to land ’ s end the swath of coast clear cut and buried in sand mangrove live oak gulfweed razed and replaced by thin palms— palmettos—symbols of victory or defiance over and over marking this vanquished land i returned to a field of cotton hallowed ground— as slave legend goes—each boll holding the ghosts of generations those who measured their days by the heft of sacks and lengths of rows whose sweat flecked the cotton plants still sewn into our clothes i returned to a country battlefield where colored troops fought and died— port hudson where their bodies swelled and blackened beneath the sun—unburied until earth ’ s green sheet pulled over them unmarked by any headstones where the roads buildings and monuments are named to honor the confederacy where that old flag still hangs i return to mississippi state that made a crime of me—mulatto half-breed—native in my native land this place they ’ ll bury me

the white train emerges from a dark curtain of tall fir trees with its coat of light snow the white train appears as though newly escaped from the jaws of night the white train steams out of the forest into the clear white meadow melting the fresh snow around it the trees are towering ancient giants a whole section seems to have been logged over there the folded arms of soldiers who gather in small groups we can not see leaders or individual faces horsemen far away on their way to the revolution perhaps in the dining car behind the velvet curtains— blood puddings and sea pie clear soups and small marrow already today the chef has cooked three luncheons while crossing poland the starched waiters managed without spilling a drop dozens of dirty white napkins heap on hampers like miniature alps threatening to fall but now the train has braked and stopped small boys fog the windows with their warm breath as they watch the soldiers with silver sabers who order everyone off the train into the new snow

the cement plant was like a huge still nailed in gray corrugated panels and left out forty-five years ago in the null center of a meadow to tax itself to remorseless death near a black stream and briars where from the moment it began to breathe it began falling apart and burning but it still went and the men were paid the plant made dust impalpably fine hung in a tawny alkaline cloud swept into drifts against mill room piers frozen by rain on silo ledges dust was its first and its final cause pinups were traced on their car windshields dust gave them jobs and killed some of them late into evening their teeth grated its product was dust its problem dust the thing was blind to all its own ends but the one men ’ s ordinary lives measured out on a scale alien to that on which its life was measured were spent in crawling the junk machine fitting new gaskets screws and bearings deceiving it towards the mood required for it to avail and pay somehow it did none cheered it it sustained them

the word is the making of the world —wallace stevens it ’ s a filmstrip afternoon and we ’ re all grateful to the humming projector in the middle of our desks the closed blinds the absence of a real adult there ’ s a vague promise of revelation from the title and the dark tree-lined streets the voice calling from a house carrying within it our freedom not to answer inside another house a little girl in a pretty dress is falling asleep at her father ’ s desk turning into alice in wonderland as her mind falls down the rabbit holes of grammar the mad hatter and jabberwocky tell her to lure the letters into a trap so they can beat them to death with mallets we ’ d like to see that without words no one could tell us what to do we know grammar is just a byproduct like schizophrenia of a brain that grew too fast for its own good and that history is a series of conspiracies by accidental despots mrs. bradford is falling asleep on the wide window ledge her blue polyester pants gapped to reveal her white socks and pink spotted shins we try not to look the mad hatter doesn ’ t say that the alphabet was first used to keep track of property or that for centuries people believed if women learned to write the lost world would never be recovered or that the mayans believed outsiders wrote things down not in order to remember them but to free themselves into the work of forgetting that year mrs. bradford taught us about the lewis clark expedition over and over again we never learned why it mattered so much to her or what possible use it could be to anyone the professor tells judy about the thousands of words arabs needed for camels and their parts the dozen words eskimos had for snow and a chimp who learned seven human words a voice made visible says magic is a matter of fact to you every miracle has to have its qualifications reservations footnotes and our heads rise from our desks the rest of the year will be a series of substitute teachers who teach us nothing but footnotes and their own reservations mrs. bradford dead of a brain tumor we sit in our sixth-grade desks with the blinds closed against the tree-lined streets as the letters of the world rise up and forming a single word eclipse our world and fill our mouths with shadows
how something is made flesh no one can say the buffalo soup becomes a woman who sings every day to her horses or summons another to her private body saying come touch this is how it begins the path of a newly born who salvaged from other lives and worlds will grow to become a woman a man with a heart that never rests and the gathered berries the wild grapes enter the body human wine which can love where nothing created is wasted the swallowed grain takes you through the dreams of another night the deer meat becomes hands strong enough to work but i love most the white-haired creature eating green leaves the sun shines there swallowed showing in her face taking in all the light and in the end when the shadow from the ground enters the body and remains in the end you might say this is myself still unknown still a mystery

for one thing there ’ s no more snow to watch from an evening window and no armfuls of logs to carry into the house so cumbersome you have to touch the latch with an elbow and once inside no iron stove waiting like an old woman for her early dinner of wood no hexagrams of frost to study carefully on the cold glass pages of the bathroom and there ’ s no black sweater to pull over my head while i wait for the coffee to brew instead i walk around in children ’ s clothes— shorts and a t-shirt with the name of a band lettered on the front announcing me to nobody the sun never fails to arrive early and refuses to leave the party even after i go from room to room turning out all the lights and making a face and the birds with those long white necks all they do is swivel their heads to look at me as i walk past as if they all knew my password and the name of the city where i was born
dropouts mace had the kind of courage you could easily mistake for brawn i don ’ t know why i call it courage sure he stood up to greasers and didn ’ t visibly fret on the days when his report card made hard fact of what was already apparent from his absences yet mace was gifted with an uninflected quickness a fine intelligence of his own despair a knowledge— as he gunned the engine of his once white ’ 58 chevy with a four-on-the-floor he ’ d installed himself to climb higher into the hills above the city— of where nowhere was… light shadow cutting brusquely across the canyons— like everyone else in our class mace was a year older than me he had stubble on his chin i dragged a razor up and down my cheeks to inspire fast early growth “ don ’ t shave your jowls ” friends warned knowing i overdid everything “ or you ’ ll grow hair there later. ” later was a word i disdained its insistence on the future tense postponement— life on the back burner mace seemed incapable of worry his coolness and insouciance made girls stare he was always brushing back the shock of raven- black hair that fell over his right eyebrow the same teacher who sent me lickety split to the principal ’ s office would lean over mace ’ s desk and whisper warmly compassionately in his ear they would nod together i could fill in every blank “ what ’ s the matter richard ” “ nothing. ” “ if you ’ re having trouble ” this is where the whispering grew most intense “ i want you to feel you can talk to me as a friend your work in class is so good you have so much ability richard… ” mace would never protest never defend himself indignation was a country where he ’ d never been “ you may hate me ” i thought praying she would not double the insult of the absence of her concern for me with a glance in my direction “ but deep down mace and i are the same. ” mace and i were running into the same problem at the same time mathematical wizards that we were we couldn ’ t solve advanced algebraic equations in our head we were vexed by an added integer we had gotten this far without lifting a pencil history was being sold to us as a dead language of fixed events and we wouldn ’ t buy what is a fact i wondered and i could see the same question wrinkling mace ’ s brow mace ’ s problems weren ’ t academic his disgust thrummed like telephone wires in the wind even his saturnine presence was deceptive like his beat-up chevy with its secret store of power concealed under the hood mace too began the year in the front row placed there on the strength of pure ability he sank slowly buoyed as i was by the one assigned book we read great expectations mace attended to his tasks in the classroom i dreamt of escape via the window ’ s easy access there were unknown roads to be driven gulleys to be plumbed girls a world of lovely distractions for all the years i lived in salt lake city i can ’ t remember seeing a single bird i felt watched in salt lake city ever since that first day when the old geezer stepped out of the shadows on a street vast and empty and without verticals to reprimand my double- mint gum wrapper for lighting in the gutter but only around the time of hitchcock ’ s the birds did i start to withdraw from sight i was keen to see the birds the wednesday afternoon it opened and i wanted the other— “ good ” — “ mark r. ” the irreproachable blond mormon angel everyone loved to join us our growling engine brought his mother to the porch the sun glared on her helmet of curlers mark had “ homework and chores ” she said he “ can ’ t come down. ” but he had already descended and stood framed in the doorway i couldn ’ t get accustomed to the light in the trampled meadows around his house the glow of dandelions thistles weeds mark ’ s red cheeks reeked of aspiration and i could read his thoughts why couldn ’ t i wait until night why was i dragging myself down why skip history and rifle assembly the movie would wait but i would not i was keen and seeking a purging terror to cleanse me of my dread i sat alone with mace in the vast empty theater alive to each click and flicker in the projection room and the radiant impalpable dust caught in the unstinting beam released from the limits of our world until the screeching stopped and looked at askance by strangers we stepped into an iron dark which held no trace of the light we ’ d left i forked over whatever change i had to fuel each day ’ s free-wheeling splendor one morning knowing mace was down to smoking butts i brought a pack of my mother ’ s kents as an offering mace scorned them he only smoked marlboros yet later desperate and broke in the maze of roads through the hills overlooking the city he broke off the filters and smoked in silence i was used to doing the talking for the two of us but this was different he pulled up besides a long driveway a vaulted roof jutted above columns of tall firs this was where he lived he ’ d be “ a sec ” —he had “ some smokes ” stashed in a drawer i followed him past the plaster jockey and the massy trees toward an opulent utterly contemporary house fronted by oak door and gold bell-knocker angular white high-ceilinged skylit… our apartment could have fit into the living room… now i understood mace lived in the clouds though i couldn ’ t see beyond the back yard through the landscaping i knew what the view must be like that was the reason to live there for the nights when the city innocent as it was still blazed through its grid of interlocking lights on may day mace and i long ago tossed out of r.o.t.c for “ insubordination ” but required to attend the final show-of-arms sat together in the bleachers in splendid isolation and watched as the rule-followers—led by the many-striped other mark r.— in their woolen khaki uniforms shouldering their m 1 rifles dropped like flies in the insuperable heat
and yesterday something shattering happened not yesterday but several that ’ s becoming a favorite word weeks ago i came across kitaj ’ s the jewish rider and wept there he was in the very image of my stepfather the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic the same skinny legs the same misguided attempt to dress in a sporty way who ’ s watching the same abstractedness the same shlumpy—boneless—posture gazing not at the landscape flashing past with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one tug the countryside would vanish or listening to the tick of the rails but fixed—distractedly—on his lower extremities white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon socks to see whether or not he should roll them up … no looking both beyond and through physical space into an inner dark why else draw the eyes as shadows it ’ s his glimpse into another world my mother ’ s father hunted and rode my father rode and fished my stepfather never budged from his barca lounger once the amber liquid began to pour he had a spiritual life and a social life and no physical life but he liked it that i was always outside maybe that ’ s why he never got on my back about grades he might have thought that this boy has to be outside at this time in his life maybe it ’ s more important that he roam the canyons and the hills that he know the streets that he come home covered with leaves and bark and mud than that he sit there like a good young scholar like i was a rabbi at twenty giving money home to my parents in their cabbagy tenement in the bronx this is a boy who needs space one time— i think i had my learner 's permit— he rented a mustang convertible in l.a. and for several days i drove around past the long rows of used car lots and the bruised facades of restaurants digging up relatives my hoarse-voiced arthritic aunt in the shadows of her goldenrod colored ranch house limping like ruffian after her last run in the wet dirt at belmont stakes but i ’ ve said nothing about what made me weep it 's in the contrast between kitaj 's alter cocker seeking comfort on a train and rembrandt ’ s taut youth setting off into the rampant amber on horseback it ’ s in the image of active life juxtaposed with the image of sedentary contemplation— though no one travels on horseback now and heroism has become attending aids patients or sheltering the homeless the raw youth ’ s feet are planted lightly yet firmly in his stirrups his coat glows with many colors not so the jewish rider and yet—there 's something more michael hoffman writes that new york is not what it was when i was too young to have marked the existence of the blue note but i can pick up this trail by walking across the park to the frick and barbara hershey wouldn ’ t have been at the frick in 1959 they don ’ t allow children under sixteen in black skin tight pants black sweater the female uniform of our generation whose male version substitutes black jeans baseball hat and bomber jacket— though who knows what decorous garments she ’ d checked in the cloakroom and white boots with plenty of elizabethan ruff at the edges pausing to look at the polish rider while i scribbled notes her white boots stood out against the dominant dark like the jewish rider ’ s white loafers and that was good because the light in the painting is brief whatever the time of day sunrise or sunset and the rider ’ s gaze looking out over unknown space is inward i followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases where clouds roll over harbors against the whiteness of sails or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms then back to meet wisdom ’ s bared breast in veronese ’ s wisdom and strength… why didn ’ t veronese have the nerve to call his painting woman with bare breasts like tintoretto why an allegorical title when the bare flesh and bones and sinew would have done he spends his life looking not at far off hills or citadels or the lights in the village below he has no choice but to fix on her one bared breast her swelling nipple i can ’ t figure out what landscape he might be facing in the painted world the clatter of rocks and hooves echoes over the stony plain i was no rider but a pretend horse and rider always rode beside my train window—at a canter no matter how fast the rails clicked by— and though he wore a bandana and leaned slightly forward in the saddle to pull himself aboard his gaze wide-ranging yet intent was like the polish rider ’ s even as an only child i was never lonely my mother 's father rode until he was old and on a narrow pass his horse jammed him up against rockface in his narrative of his life this collision marked the ruin of his hip the rise of his cataracts my father rode “ every morning before work. ” i never witnessed that but at a ranch in upper new york state while i bloodied my hands tugging the reins of a frothing giant who would not budge from a weedpatch i watched him disappear in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs as he galloped over a far off hill more at ease in the saddle—in the air— than i ’ d ever seen him in civilian life my woman friend in el paso lives to ride only the jewish rider and i do not ride that ’ s the stuff of events what about the signature inscribed by the sun the dark clouds sinister in just being there thresholds exchanges going on in the village below candles lit in the deep interiors bread wine the plate making its way around the table what about— leaping centuries ahead— the energy from generators blazing like auras through the clouds the scattered lights the rotating tops of ambulances the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese making the rounds apple sauce passing from high chair to bib the wonder bread on a calcified plate children eating heads down in silence communicating through eye movements the mother wiping her lips the father grinning stupidly and drooling the television quacking in the background the perfect suburban night unfolding in bedroom and drive-in and den the sprinkler system ticking the snipers in the tower— this is what the riders guests everywhere and nowhere say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter as night comes down and last night driving to connecticut i understood that the polish rider gleans the permutations of light after dusk that its olive-gray smudges reflect the absence of pitch-darkness i was wrong about the polish rider all along he doesn ’ t depart at nightfall he stops for a moment crossing difficult terrain anticipating rockslide in the night because as the faint light rimming the edges of the sky makes clear night is not absolute black but rough-hewn and curious the rider lives in order to depart the woman who rode she hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house bare trees frost the whole bit i wanted our lives to be like that as rife with silences as a quaker meeting she came to me in her stride dropped her crop on the chair peeled off her britches and boots crawled under the covers her hour in the saddle had “ made her ready. ” i felt like an accessory the wound was open drowsily i rolled onto her no longer caring if she was using me as the new year wore on and black ice made riding a fast track to certain death or paralysis she grew tense came to me now with clinical terms “ schi ” words i worked hard to break down the good news was she was not a true “ split personality ” —the glitch that “ she was divorced from herself and could not love or care. ” the light in her house was like the light before dawn on the last of my rare visits her mother jarred preserves while we watched instant replays of robert kennedy die and die her father skulked upstairs perhaps testing gadgets or wishing me off his daughter or taking precautions i would not overhear what words were ricocheting on his “ hot line ” to the patent office any objective observer standing back from the distraction of the impinging present could see that her torment overleapt any visible signs and that she was— as a wasp “ rider ” —the wrong person for the place she was in her resilience could not be in question she lived to stray from known paths to leap stone fences and break into open fields when her horse went down in an irish bog and she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek— the next day she up and mounted him again when she came to me in the dream last night her smile had loosened how lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse how well it lit up the colors of her hair
some things no one says aloud but he was there if he says he was bleaching fields and buttermilk the stench of breweries and lye two-thirds of his life before this one sky his current city rises off a river not lek though here in the gallery a train ride away the impossible familiar the somehow known the curator has written on the crowded ferry cows attempt to drink but anyone can see that one scratches her neck a good-sailor cow sickle-hocked not parched cows like that yes he remembers also that downriver float the fishmongers ’ baskets of haddock and crab on the way home this will be also his view the river running toward its source a reverse birthing but now he sees that rembrandt has wired coils of light into the shipbuilder ’ s ruff he remembers shipbuilders the horizon upon which sailed their fluyts and above which homesick that was what we call a long time ago because it has to be called something and now the guard warns him back from one world rose hip willow sea salt the infinite clouds
here comes rain on our roof it stays just long enough to tickle me into writing this it stays just long enough for everybody to get into a pair of pjs silk-cotton blend and then goes poof at our best we exude awesomeness at our best we are destined to turn pale with the rest of humanity we are awesome and quick as decomposing sticks at a trail ’ s end we bend dreams into circles of green zone satire we have mahogany stuffed in our mahogany ears to all who are not us we are sorry to say you ’ re welcome nature thankfully adores a rumor a sunset a glacier clouds glimmer and cast inevitable shadows off the groundswell footrest i remember you from that time before we first met when our eyes were wet like summertime coasters as we ubered noiselessly between pews the aristocrats are failing to panhandle via email one aristocrat is sleepily winding through the face of another
1 —yet sitting with so little blood leaving me to cause this fatigue on top of the picnic table my ankles are now over its precipice of at the air over its edge over even the hollow circular and flat thin stalks and grass blades growing fast with so much speed no hurry i can see beneath my feet kicking into the summer air —— looking up from underneath in front of the on- rushing speed of a cloud throwing its first thrust-shudders over the top edge of the mountain like i thought a spreading out of the unlawed — up from underneath its white cloud edge especially harvested by all these fir and spruce and aspen and pine top edges jutting fragrant fierce with hot smell spill- outs of their seeds growing the indent- ing of the mountain in their evergreen to blue tone scented modulatings taperings moorings which the now big cloud passing over also harvests push ing some kind of lawlessness 2 along — — up from my feet i ’ ve stopped kicking or now forget to kick underneath the great white cloud moving at varying and breakneck speeds — which i imagine is unlawed though i am not moving — imagine moving out from its nature but it is not a law passing over the air waves the satellite dish the meta- llic meticulous signals — i am losing neither a little nor a lot of blood — over the dropped down landscape thundering along its applause sounds its green to brown to amber under- neath feathering along its before-fatigue­ intricacy which harvests the let me come closer in — the sun a windfall enabling so much of it roving the mountain from almost its very beginning to its very present height the world surges as world against then dives out from into air and the lightflow at its fast one only speed all smashing into what looks like a lumpy eternity me and the black summer fly in its engines a repose in the windflow and in its bumping up against and in its bumping up against though i think it is also mortal of moving of collision of chance encounter until their currents until their wakes let you in let you through —
you would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead but i have lived two decades longer now than you and all this time i have carried you in my head so i think i have the right to question what you said dear teacher my religious upbringing ’ s residue you would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead however is sometimes necessary especially haunted by all the things i know you hoped i ’ d do with all this time that i have carried you in my head in a dream last night i followed where you led until you asked me in a loud voice what i knew you would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead but i was dreaming and could not refuse i said that you were wrong that i could see your bitter view since all this time i have carried you in my head for what it was and you for who you were instead of dreaming your reply i woke as you withdrew you would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead but all this time i have carried you in my head
we make midnight a maquette of the year frostlight glinting off snow to solemnize the vows we offer to ourselves in near silence the competition shimmerwise of champagne and chandeliers to attract laughter and cheers the glow from the fireplace reflecting the burning intra-red pact between beloveds we cosset the space of a fey hour anxious gods molding our hoped-for adams with this temporal clay each of us edacious for shining or rash enough to think sacrifice will stay this fugacious time while stillness suspends vitality in balance as passions struggle with passions for sway the mind wends towards what ’ s to come a callithump of fashions ersatz smiles crowded days a bloodless cut that severs soul from bone a long aching quiet in which we will hear nothing but the clean crack of our promises breaking
what ’ s there to say we didn ’ t care for him much and you can ’ t exactly commiserate with someone you don ’ t just not love but almost admit it hate so the news just hung over us like the dud summer weather we ’ d had— rain since june the lawn sodden garden a bog all slugs late blight so bad our sickened beefsteak vines our sweet one hundreds san marzanos the lot yellowed half black before the fruit had set which when it did began to bloat and rot before it ripened—but like i say and not to speak ill of the dead we just didn ’ t care for him which is probably all there is to be said
we had been married for six or seven years when my wife standing in the kitchen one afternoon told me that she screams underwater when she swims— that in fact she has been screaming for years into the blue chlorinated water of the community pool where she does laps every other day buttering her toast not as if she had been concealing anything not as if i should consider myself personally the cause of her screaming nor as if we should perform an act of therapy right that minute on the kitchen table —casually she told me and i could see her turn her square face up to take a gulp of oxygen then down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious for all i know maybe everyone is screaming as they go through life silently politely keeping the big secret that it is not all fun to be ripped by the crooked beak of something called psychology to be dipped down again and again into time that the truest most intimate pleasure you can sometimes find is the wet kiss of your own pain there goes kath at one pm to swim her twenty-two laps back and forth in the community pool —what discipline she has twenty-two laps like twenty-two pages that will never be read by anyone
i had a calling i took the call it was all i could do to follow the voice streaming into me like traffic on the runway where i lay down to gather i had a calling i heard the geese bleat in the firmament as they migrated into the jet ’ s jets and could i have foreseen that falling i could have fallen too rather than being sutured to the bottomless freeze-out lake for it is fine to lie within one ’ s borrowed blankets looking up at the dropped ceiling coming down for at the moment i am employed counting the holes in the sound absorbing tiles keeping a running record of the interlocutor ’ s chides i feel at one with extinction by my own hand inner hand though once there were many of my kind flocking inland or perhaps it felt that way
another day come add it to the list the not to do list son of mine i was rambling across the undercarpeting strewn with imperceptible tacks in one shapeless slip-on when a pain rang out in my flank and i fell to braying but who should answer but no one i lost good cause that day don ’ t ask let us sit a bit in this ill-starred suit in the form-filling chamber of subtraction listing i haven ’ t another trip around the sun left in me speak to me son vague one for this is where it thickens me here and it there and me there and them here and you with the soul i ’ ll cross that gravid boneyard all the day poking radishes for remembrance for this is a private matter between a man and his scaffolding and it shall remain so privation permitting
out of cash out of well-fitting trousers out of soap and apples out of pencils out of my keeper ’ s reach i wish to set myself afire but may not this morning last night in the common room i watched the administration of oxygen to one who had none and i would not sit down demanding to do so later i happened on a man at the piano and though i have happened five or six times on men at the piano none moved his hand like this within the keys i sat beside him looking for a sound a chest sound not listening i don ’ t listen anymore i make music but i don ’ t listen
where did you get such a dirty face my darling dirty-faced child i got it from crawling along in the dirt and biting two buttons off jeremy ’ s shirt i got it from chewing the roots of a rose and digging for clams in the yard with my nose i got it from peeking into a dark cave and painting myself like a navajo brave i got it from playing with coal in the bin and signing my name in cement with my chin i got it from rolling around on the rug and giving the horrible dog a big hug i got it from finding a lost silver mine and eating sweet blackberries right off the vine i got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears and from having more fun than you ’ ve had in years
she had the jitters she had the flu she showed up late she missed her cue she kicked the director she screamed at the crew and tripped on a prop and fell in some goo and ripped her costume a place or two then she forgot a line she knew and went “ meow ” instead of “ moo ” she heard ‘ em giggle she heard ‘ em boo the programs sailed the popcorn flew as she stomped offstage with a boo-hoo-hoo the fringe of the curtain got caught in her shoe the set crashed down the lights did too maybe that ’ s why she didn ’ t want to do an interview
the word itself prim retired its artifact her portrait above the fireplace on her face the boredom she abhorred then perfected her hands held upward—their emptiness a revision cigarette and brandy snifter painted intolerably out to leave her this lesser gesture what next or shrugged whatever from the waist down she was never there

we could paint semi-darkness in semi-darkness and the ‘ right lighting ’ of a picture could be semi-darkness wittgenstein from remarks on color these islands lie off the west coast of ireland as if nothing matters the people have lived here for centuries with only a thin covering of soil over the surface great use is made of the seaweed the cattle swimming out the women here are justly famous they weave their own tweed and make a type of belt called criss the heavy atlantic seas the slip stitch the difficulty of the patterns are never written down most impressive and rich the trellis pattern and the rope the tribute to the hardworking bee but sometimes their knitting shows mistakes with a true irish touch of nothing really matters a careless nonchalance of the crossing of their cables and note mistakes in the simple patterns forked lightning or cliff paths small fields fenced with stone the ups and downs of married life the mosses the openwork has a religious significance or none sometimes the clarity of the pattern is lost through the use of very fine wool green from the mosses brown from the seaweed grey and cream color from the stones and pebbles many are distinctly over-bobbled no matter they are too lovely to be lost wool and knitting leaflets can be obtained in no case is the whole pattern given there are certain gaps and yawns and part of the pattern is left out as if it doesn ’ t matter or was too lovely so was lost some of the simple patterns are charming for children ’ s jerseys this one for example would be lovely on a child

“ fly at once ” he said “ all is discovered. ” — edward gorey in miami this may afternoon i look up the sky hot so hot always and heating up hotter — how long i have loved this scene the clouds are white optimistic churches i can not number them herons pelicans and gulls glide like dreams through cloud-portals cloud-porticos and cloud-porte-cochères giotto could have done with his passion for blues and dimensions hard not to love a place always called by possibility nearby cuba is singing and somewhere here richard blanco is writing his poems as i enter the city my bishop walks with a cane towards our cathedral the sun shines on the people and unites us in a delirium of light high above this bleached scorched fragile groin-scented peninsula the birds track their insects and remain loyal to their nests i look up and i feel bliss building as i did when my father read another book to me and another the pages like wings there are moments of memorable patience in this world airplanes advance towards miami international booked with jewish retirees and cuban émigrés— their descending engines disrupt the white-gloved illegal waiters at the country clubs in coral gables who deliver flan to the ladies who have pulled their skin behind their ears like gum this is a place where few decisions are doubted on south beach where everyone rearranges or expands their sexual parts there seems to be no life outside the physical and time becomes a tricky thing here spring looks like winter winter like spring the scenes dense shifting shut — and before you know it the rats have preached from the mangoes and then chewed them to corpses and look how the interior decorators unroll their fresh bolts and wink-wink to new clients — what would be considered frivolous anywhere else is here pondered and coerced at great length the feminine gains strength moving closer to the cathedral the sea presses the harbor wanting to be loved pushing up the cruise ships with its muscles the sea says “ i am the sea. ” we have seen cubans come atop dolphins ’ backs here mothers have drowned for their sons but the cool gray backs of the dolphins have buoyed their children to us numbed by the lullaby of sonar clicks the sea blesses the city the way mothers do — forceful pushy ungraspable persistent the black mangrove shoots take root on the porous chalky rock building themselves up like steeples listen how the waves love what does not love them back pedicurists buff the toenails of the sugar daddies in the delano lincoln road refines its scarlet seductions bees are sticky with tourism inside the motel rooms of the rose red-orange petals from the royal poincianas tint the minutes with flamboyance the pink and white bottlebrush trees explode with seeds i will always love my time in this city you might say craziest of cities delivering its youth in short-shorts and rollerblades with rainbow sweatbands city smelling of unzipped things cha cha cha cha cha cha i do not think the city will ever be mine beautiful spanish and broken english spoken everywhere how i love that sound for it is the sound of people making their way where they were not born maids from honduras push their carts stacking their wrapped soaps counting them like children their cuticles sting with disinfectant perspiration staining their uniforms as they pray over the toilet seats they clean o miami for a decade i did not speak to my parents are you listening to me i will not bore you with details instead i will tell you something new listen to me i was angry but the reasons no longer interest me i take the liberty of assuming you approve of forgiveness stressing hardening gentleness as you do i speak to the bishop about my call and the sacraments we discuss blessings absolutions consecrations— our work of the soul the soul has no sex and i am relieved to speak of a thing alive in the world that has no sex the bishop places a paperweight atop my reports on his desk our professional talk is measured by the silence of the dead who are always flinging open their shutters religion being the work of the living and the dead the hope and release in the hearts of parents turning to their children and the hearts of children turning to their parents — all that business in life that remains unrehearsed superior to obedient we pray the laughter of the bathers through the grillwork of the office window pleases me their movements rinsed in the baptism of the sea the languorous sea the sky at the end of the city trembles light and dust warm to cream to pink to lavender miami it has been a gorgeous day indeed thank you how i love your decks bridges promenades and balconies — the paraphernalia of connection how fast the pastels encroach upon the edges i have a dinner engagement in coral gables at books books where i will see the poet richard blanco i hope he will tell me stories of his beloved broken cuba nearly five o ’ clock now and i am late when i arrive richard blanco speaks of cuba as i had wished and the city quiets all around him “ if our bodies house our souls ” i think to myself “ then richard poets are the interior decorators of the mind. ” richard blanco is saying something about going back his relatives singing poems in the fields i listen behind us in the palmetum at the fairchild tropical botanic gardens the elephant date malaysian kiwi coconut and royal palms ask the city to remember their names with the insistence of priests good-bye miami good-bye good-bye to the workers laying down the grids of the concrete embeds on the high-rises reinforcing their masculine nests gluing glass with their spermy compounds to stone and steel good-bye to you south beach let your rapturous sands darken to a deep grape color let the polished feet of youth launch into their surprises and swaps let the elements cool good-bye richard blanco good-bye today my candidacy for holy orders was affirmed i listen to the sea flatten cuba pleads in the distance one more night honduras waits on too many things to count no longer can i stand still stars smooth the sea with their immaculate highways of long lights mother and father forgive me my absence i will always be moving quietly toward you

not to be in love with you i can ’ t remember what it was like it must ’ ve been lousy james schuyler you take off your black motorcycle jacket hang it on the back of a chair it ’ s cold from our walk along the sea wall your pockets jingle with shells while we were gone you left the stove on low—some things you do make me so nervous you graze the surface of sauce simmering in a pan shiny fingertip held out for me to lick you say “ what does it need ” maybe nothing maybe honey to unbitter the lime later that night you ’ ll bury your face in my belly and sob “ i ’ m sorry ” though i don ’ t think you are always talking to me my love but now lobster steam billows up the window you gulp purple wine your pinky sticking out and the round olives are the green all green things aspire to be
1. falmouth massachusetts 1972 oak table knotted legs the chirp and scrape of tines to mouth four children four engines of want that music what did your hand mean to smooth across the casket of your belly what echoed there if not me—tiny body afloat akimbo awake or at rest every night you fed the others bread leavened with the grains of your own want how could you stand me near you in you jump and kick tricking the heart when what you prayed for was my father ’ s shadow your name in his dangerous script an envelope smelling of gun-powder bay rum someone to wrestle sing to question climb 2. interstate 101 south california 1981 remember the radio the coca-cola sign phosphorescent to the left bridge after bridge as though our lives were engineered simply to go and so we went into those few quiet hours alone together in the dark my arm on the rest beside yours our lights pricking at fog tugging us patiently forward like a needle through gauze night held us like a house sometimes an old song would fill the car like a ghost 3. leroy alabama 2005 there ’ s still a pond behind your mother ’ s old house still a stable with horses a tractor rusted and stuck like a trophy in mud and the red house you might have thrown stones at still stands on stilts up the dirt road a girl from the next town over rides in to lend us her colt cries when one of us kicks it with spurs her father wants to buy her a trailer let her try her luck in the shows they stay for dinner under the tent your brother put up for the fourth firebugs flare and vanish i am trying to let go of something my heart cluttered with names that mean nothing our racket races out to the darkest part of the night the woods catch it and send it back 4. but let ’ s say you ’ re alive again— your hands are long and tell your age you hold them there twirling a bent straw and my reflection watches hollow-faced not trying to hide the waiters make it seem like cairo back and forth shouting that sharp language and for the first time i tell you everything no shame in my secrets shoddy as laundry i have praised your god for the blessing of the body snuck from pleasure to pleasure lying for it holding it like a coin or a key in my fist i know now you ’ ve known all along i won ’ t change i want to give everything away to wander forever here is a pot of tea let ’ s share it slowly like sisters
1. we like to think of it as parallel to what we know only bigger one man against the authorities or one man against a city of zombies one man who is not in fact a man sent to understand the caravan of men now chasing him like red ants let loose down the pants of america man on the run man with a ship to catch a payload to drop this message going out to all of space though maybe it ’ s more like life below the sea silent buoyant bizarrely benign relics of an outmoded design some like to imagine a cosmic mother watching through a spray of stars mouthing yes yes as we toddle toward the light biting her lip if we teeter at some ledge longing to sweep us to her breast she hopes for the best while the father storms through adjacent rooms ranting with the force of kingdom come not caring anymore what might snap us in its jaw sometimes what i see is a library in a rural community all the tall shelves in the big open room and the pencils in a cup at circulation gnawed on by the entire population the books have lived here all along belonging for weeks at a time to one or another in the brief sequence of family names speaking at night mostly to a face a pair of eyes the most remarkable lies 2. charlton heston is waiting to be let in he asked once politely a second time with force from the diaphragm the third time he did it like moses arms raised high face an apocryphal white shirt crisp suit trim he stoops a little coming in then grows tall he scans the room he stands until i gesture then he sits birds commence their evening chatter someone fires charcoals out below he ’ ll take a whiskey if i have it water if i don ’ t i ask him to start from the beginning but he goes only halfway back that was the future once he says before the world went upside down hero survivor god ’ s right hand man i know he sees the blank surface of the moon where i see a language built from brick and bone he sits straight in his seat takes a long slow high-thespian breath then lets it go for all i know i was the last true man on this earth and may i smoke the voices outside soften planes jet past heading off or back someone cries that she does not want to go to bed footsteps overhead a fountain in the neighbor ’ s yard babbles to itself and the night air lifts the sound indoors it was another time he says picking up again we were pioneers will you fight to stay alive here riding the earth toward god-knows-where i think of atlantis buried under ice gone one day from sight the shore from which it rose now glacial and stark our eyes adjust to the dark 3. perhaps the great error is believing we ’ re alone that the others have come and gone—a momentary blip— when all along space might be choc-full of traffic bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel nor see flush against us living dying deciding setting solid feet down on planets everywhere bowing to the great stars that command pitching stones at whatever are their moons they live wondering if they are the only ones knowing only the wish to know and the great black distance they—we—flicker in maybe the dead know their eyes widening at last seeing the high beams of a million galaxies flick on at twilight hearing the engines flare the horns not letting up the frenzy of being i want to be one notch below bedlam like a radio without a dial wide open so everything floods in at once and sealed tight so nothing escapes not even time which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke so that i might be sitting now beside my father as he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe for the first time in the winter of 1959 4. in those last scenes of kubrick ’ s 2001 when dave is whisked into the center of space which unfurls in an aurora of orgasmic light before opening wide like a jungle orchid for a love-struck bee then goes liquid paint-in-water and then gauze wafting out and off before finally the night tide luminescent and vague swirls in and on and on in those last scenes as he floats above jupiter ’ s vast canyons and seas over the lava strewn plains and mountains packed in ice that whole time he doesn ’ t blink in his little ship blind to what he rides whisked across the wide-screen of unparcelled time who knows what blazes through his mind is it still his life he moves through or does that end at the end of what he can name on set it ’ s shot after shot till kubrick is happy then the costumes go back on their racks and the great gleaming set goes black 5. when my father worked on the hubble telescope he said they operated like surgeons scrubbed and sheathed in papery green the room a clean cold a bright white he ’ d read larry niven at home and drink scotch on the rocks his eyes exhausted and pink these were the reagan years when we lived with our finger on the button and struggled to view our enemies as children my father spent whole seasons bowing before the oracle-eye hungry for what it would find his face lit-up whenever anyone asked and his arms would rise as if he were weightless perfectly at ease in the never-ending night of space on the ground we tied postcards to balloons for peace prince charles married lady di rock hudson died we learned new words for things the decade changed the first few pictures came back blurred and i felt ashamed for all the cheerful engineers my father and his tribe the second time the optics jibed we saw to the edge of all there is— so brutal and alive it seemed to comprehend us back
there will be no edges but curves clean lines pointing only forward history with its hard spine dog-eared corners will be replaced with nuance just like the dinosaurs gave way to mounds and mounds of ice women will still be women but the distinction will be empty sex having outlived every threat will gratify only the mind which is where it will exist for kicks we 'll dance for ourselves before mirrors studded with golden bulbs the oldest among us will recognize that glow— but the word sun will have been re-assigned to the standard uranium-neutralizing device found in households and nursing homes and yes we 'll live to be much older thanks to popular consensus weightless unhinged eons from even our own moon we 'll drift in the haze of space which will be once and for all scrutable and safe

in a crumpled shirt so casual for a god bow tucked loosely under an arm still jittery from battle he balanced himself on a flat boat painted black each wave as i kneel closer a migrant flag a tongue with syllables no script can catch the many births you have passed through try to remember them as i do mine memory is all you have still how much can you bear on your back you ’ ve lost one language gained another lost a third there ’ s nothing you ’ ll inherit neither per stirpes nor per capita no plot by the riverbank in your father ’ s village of kozencheri or by the burning ghat in varanasi all you have is a writing hand smeared with ink and little bits of paper swirling in a violent wind i am a blue-black child cheeks swollen with a butter ball i stole from mama ’ s kitchen stones and sky and stars melt in my mouth wooden spoon in hand she chased me round and round the tamarind tree i am musk in the wings of the koel which nests in that tree — you heard its cry in the jolting bus from santa monica to malibu after the ferris wheel the lovers with their wind slashed hair toxic foam on the drifts of the ocean come the dry cactus lands the child who crosses the border water bottle in hand fallen asleep in the aisle where backpacks and sodden baskets are stashed out of her soiled pink skirt whirl these blood-scratched skies and all the singing rifts of story
on occasion when the mood takes him as it so often does he will put down his papers get up from his kindly old chair and leave for a while the sweeping beam to sow its charitable seed — that seed which when falling on the ground of a helmsman ’ s fertile consciousness ought germinate in it a cautious vigilance he descends then the long corkscrew of the stairs and opens at their base the metal door so that he may take a closer look at what might be beyond his tower ’ s environs there he always finds the churning world she laps at him from every side with no respite and spatters him with spray thanks to a certain modulation a tone which he adopted long ago when he still wore shorts and buckled shoes there is no danger here from neither shark nor crocodile not in this sea stuffed as it is like a dressing-up box with whimsy indeed were there such creatures hidden neath the sliver-thin surface of the waves they ’ d have no teeth but only soft gray gums and goofy grins and they ’ d be giggling knowingly at the whole thing and so it is that as he gazes out he can not help but wonder what it is he might be warning of with the light that turns atop his tower because that tower is itself in fact the only hazard anywhere on which a ship might rip her wooden skin and haemorrhage her lumpy blood that ’ s made of all the gasping sailormen

i teach my friend a fisherman gone blind to cast true left right or center and how far between lily pads and the fallen cedar darkness is precious how long will darkness last our bait worms have no professors they live in darkness can be taught fear of light cut into threes even sixes they live separate lives recoil from light he tells me “ i am seldom blind when i dream morning is anthracite i play blind man ’ s bluff i can not find myself my shoe the sink tell time but that ’ s spilled milk and ink the lost and found i can not find i can tell the difference between a mollusk and a whelk a grieving liar and a lemon rind. ” laughing he says “ i still hope the worm will turn pink lank and warm dined out on apples of good fortune books have a faintly legible smell divorced from the sun i am a kind of bachelor henpecked by the night sometimes i use my darkness well— in the overcast and sunlight of my mind i can still wink sing my eyes are songs. ” darkness is precious how long will darkness last he could not fish he could not walk he fell in his own feces he wept he died where he fell the power of beauty to right all wrongs is hard for me to sell

if a garden is the world counted and found analogue in nature one does not become two by ever ending so the stairs must be uneven in number and not exceed thirteen without a pause of two paces ’ width which for instance the golden section mitigates between abandon and an orchestra just behind those trees gradations of green that take a stethoscope we risk length over width to make the horizon run straight equals to make the pond an oval width over length minus the width in which descending circles curl into animals exact as a remainder which means excess the meaning of the real always exceeds that of the ideal said someone he was speaking of vaux-le-vicomte but it ’ s equally true of parking or hunting or wishing you could take it back he who is allen weiss actually said “ the meaning of a plastic or pictorial construct always surpasses the ideal meaning of that work. ” which is something else entirely said the axonometric divided by the anamorphic there is nothing that controls our thoughts more than what we think we see which we label “ we ”

for tim it was in august such a lovely summer that i began the massacring the flower killing feeding the sunflowers to the industrial dough mixer soon there was enough yellow petal pulp for twelve loaves for twelve times ten loaves for twelve hundred loaves one of the food critics in town came around to inquire about my baking system i glanced at the machete propped next to the ovens toward october and what auburn weather i still felt it the substance of the soul the libidinal terrible whatever i sat out back with the two countergirls haley and shayla there was one cigarette and we were sharing mourning is the horizon of all desire we were commiserating but haley and shayla they ’ re— they sell kaiser rolls and sliced sicilian and then they leave and put on a fancy tanktop and go out for the evening they go even though— the little white clematis cling to the fences at dawn the buds were dying as a sweet white bread was rising november how beautiful were the yellow mums in the thin wintry sun the bread they made had the hue of golden potatoes december specks of red in lit windows amaryllis that i stole and slaughtered and sold inside a pain de mie roll i love how in the cold my breath flowers before me january february i hacked through the ice to get at flower fetuses the breads were very seedy spring it was really beginning baguettes made entirely of white peonies brioche from the blood of purple lilacs long lines outside the bakery ’ s door what is the secret ingredient i confessed flower flowers please put me away i am desperate summer i could not go through another the woodbine had barely begun and already the mornings were full of the scent of them not one honeysuckle would go unsucked—unless— i closed the doors every season is too full of longing and rechristened myself flora i drank a vat of rose water and put both my wrists through the slicer and then i began to bleed—a white powder flour and then you came in i would have known you even if you were not wearing in your buttonhole a carnation the bakery is closed i said tersely i was bleeding profusely i loved you even before you said nothing breaks more slowly more silently than bread with my blood pouring out as a fine dry flour let me confess before i expire there on the counter in that vase fresh and pink is the corsage i was keeping for our dance
derelict thoughts scattered over the south pacific of one dying in the ship ’ s hold somewhere between 15–30 degrees latitude and 135–150 degrees southern longitude at the crux of time stretched to its limit • the ocean never finishes in the wake of boats an unceasing torment infinitely prolonged that i would not wish on my worst enemy especially since my worst enemy is myself i cross the south pacific like a deserted countryside on a winter ’ s night not even a beast in sight reduced to its own insularity i becomes island when seasick there ’ s no place for narcissus one can not drink one ’ s own likeness • in this singular life we can only scout new places other than obligation what keeps us on this earth every day approaches death—some more than others • in the year 14,000 the southern cross will shine over paris ... we will no longer exist neither perhaps will paris ... but i will be here in a certain manner if only to know it there is no black box or recorder for ships they disappear completely a ship ’ s black box is called the coffin but the only coffins that one sees on the ocean are the ships themselves there is also a black box within you it ’ s the frailness of humans they wear that fragility on the outside—eros a child a book for boats there are packages heavier and not hurried i travel like that a package in order but a piece of mail • the universe is curved like a banana i am an atheist because god does not believe enough in me he was so afraid of death that arriving in old age he felt stupid —to search for god without expectation • life opens gives and invites you—or it goes to hell one must live to write our time here is for utterance —sad animal post-cogitum • linger only with healthy ideas salty ones stupor is second nature there are those born too soon and those born too late who preserve with haunting smiles the mistakes the traces and the one born at the right moment is forever vivid intensely illuminating each instant to write is to leave the world ’ s surface to descend under the sea the smallest pencil is my tuba one doesn ’ t report great things from grand events the one suffering from depression thinks after his world tour bougainville extravagantly gave his name to a flower the botanist la billardière gave his name to a type of grass—not bad and you to what —a pail for vomit

my sister and i went out to them with sugar cubes and bridled their heads when they bent down to eat from our palms we led them over to the long white fence on which we climbed to the topmost rail then threw our legs across their backs clutching the reins to steady ourselves against their girth steering them out into the hills until we were lost or thought we were only to find ourselves at judith creek or holcomb rock where we ’ d turn back in the early dark gripping their manes crouching low galloping hard on the high soft road across the fields to the open barn
to-night again the moon ’ s white mat stretches across the dormitory floor while outside like an evil cat the pion prowls down the dark corridor planning i know to pounce on me in spite for getting leave to sleep in town last night but it was none of us who made that noise only the old brown owl that hoots and flies out of the ivy—he will say it was us boys— seigneur mon dieu the sacré soul of spies he would like to catch each dream that lies hidden behind our sleepy eyes their dream but mine—it is the moon and the wood that sees all my long life how i shall hate the trees in the place d ’ armes the dusty planes all summer through dozed with the market women in the sun and scarcely stirred to see the quiet things that crossed the square— a tiny funeral the flying shadow of a bird the hump-backed barber célestin lemaire old madame michel in her three-wheeled chair and filing past to vespers two and two the demoiselles of the pensionnat towed like a ship through the harbour bar safe into port where le petit jésus perhaps makes nothing of the look they shot at you si c ’ est défendu mais que voulez-vous it was the sun the sunshine weaves a pattern on dull stones the sunshine leaves the portraiture of dreams upon the eyes before it dies all summer through the dust hung white upon the drowsy planes till suddenly they woke with the autumn rains it is not only the little boys who have hardly got away from toys but i who am seventeen next year some nights in bed have grown cold to hear that lonely passion of the rain which makes you think of being dead and of somewhere living to lay your head as if you were a child again crying for one thing known and near your empty heart to still the hunger and the fear that pelts and beats with it against the pane but i remember smiling too at all the sun ’ s soft tricks and those autumn dreads in winter time when the grey light broke slowly through the frosted window-lace to drag us shivering from our beds and when at dusk the singing wind swung down straight from the stars to the dark country roads beyond the twinkling town striking the leafless poplar boughs as he went by like some poor stray dog by the wayside lying dead we left behind us the old world of dread i and the wind as we strode whistling on under the winter sky and then in spring for three days came the fair just as the planes were starting into bud above the caravans you saw the dancing bear pass on his chain and heard the jingle and the thud only four days ago they let you out of this dull show to slither down the montagne russe and chaff the man à la tête de veau hit slick the bull 's eye at the tir spin round and round till your head went queer on the porcs-roulants oh là là fête va pour du vin et le tête-a-tête with the girl who sugars the gaufres pauvrette how thin she was but she smiled you bet as she took your tip— “ one does not forget the good days monsieur ” said with a grace but sacrebleu what a ghost of a face and no fun too for the demoiselles of the pensionnat who were hurried past with their “ oh que c ’ est beau—ah qu ’ elle est belle ” a lap-dog ’ s life from first to last the good nights are not made for sleep nor the good days for dreaming in and at the end in the big circus tent we sat and shook and stewed like sin some children there had got—but where sent from the south perhaps—a red bouquet of roses sweetening the fetid air with scent from gardens by some far away blue bay they threw one at the dancing bear the white clown caught it from st. rémy ’ s tower the deep slow bell tolled out the hour the black clown with his dirty grin lay sprawling in the dust as she rode in she stood on a white horse—and suddenly you saw the bend of a far-off road at dawn with knights riding by a field of spears—and then the gallant day go out in storm with ragged clouds low down sullen and grey against red heavens wild and awful such a sky as witnesses against you at the end of a great battle bugles blowing blood and dust— the old morte d ’ arthur fight you must— it died in anger but it was not death that had you by the throat stopping your breath she looked like victory she rode my way she laughed at the black clown and then she flew a bird above us on the wing of her white arms and you saw through a rent in the old tent a patch of sky with one dim star she flew but not so high— and then she did not fly she stood in the bright moonlight at the door of a strange room she threw her slippers on the floor— again again you heard the patter of the rain the starving rain—it was this thing summer was this the gold mist in your eyes — oh god it dies but after death— to-night the splendour and the sting blows back and catches at your breath the smell of beasts the smell of dust the scent of all the roses in the world the sea the spring the beat of drums the pad of hoofs music the dream the dream the enchanted thing at first you scarcely saw her face you knew the maddening feet were there what called was that half-hidden white unrest to which now and then she pressed her finger-tips but as she slackened pace and turned and looked at you it grew quite bare there was not anything you did not dare — like trumpeters the hours passed until the last day of the fair in the place d ’ armes all afternoon the building birds had sung “ soon soon ” the shuttered streets slept sound that night it was full moon the path into the wood was almost white the trees were very still and seemed to stare not far before your soul the dream flits on but when you touch it it is gone and quite alone your soul stands there mother of christ no one has seen your eyes how can men pray even unto you there were only wolves ’ eyes in the wood— my mother is a woman too nothing is true that is not good with that quick smile of hers i have heard her say — i wish i had gone back home to-day i should have watched the light that so gently dies from our high window in the paris skies the long straight chain of lamps hung out along the seine i would have turned to her and let the rain beat on her breast as it does against the pane — nothing will be the same again — there is something strange in my little mother ’ s eyes there is something new in the old heavenly air of spring— the smell of beasts the smell of dust—the enchanted thing all my life long i shall see moonlight on the fern and the black trunks of trees only the hair of any woman can belong to god the stalks are cruelly broken where we trod there had been violets there i shall not care as i used to do when i see the bracken burn
tulips panted against the wall so much need to feed a crisp stem i thought as we put our fingers in the bullet holes above the bed typed captions translated photos of rivera kahlo trotsky and his wife in her boxy suit devoted smile that hopeful hat with bent feather below an image of the assassin who would get her husband in the end george herbert was what i translated the temple the only book i brought where he says the heart must be a stone on which to build god ’ s altar—no love without affliction my hard heart meets in this frame in those days i loved the jungle spread like wool below an unsteady sky and the crumbling pyramid ’ s altar top flocked with moonlight i loved the monkeys throwing sticks and rinds at tourists from their nests in the trees the noise at night the hysterical crush of insect limbs rubbing animal want all night banged against the window each with an urgent song of me me me how loud the fecund world can be mi corazon duro i wrote bored and smoke rose from other tables from the wheels of the cars on the cobbled roads and once i saw a mouse suicidal enter the frantic crowd i cried out at the park in mexico city where indians ropes on their ankles dove like fatal birds to the ground while a hassid in his 19th-century cloak kept after me speak english english he said we ’ ve all become vegetarians there isn ’ t a butcher for miles i watched his black hat disappear into the swarm of vendors masked dancers was that it devotion young and gorgeous for it i crept away one night met a german hippie and he pulled my swimsuit aside in the volcanic lake the fat costa rican ’ s coffee plantation unfolded below the ranging packs of filthy dogs the water so hot and sulfured i gleamed like something ephemeral sometimes i saw movies cheap hong kong action films dubbed into spanish with mandarin subtitles but that started to get difficult the young men dying with extravagance the improbable ballet of whizzing swords gun fights in teahouses filled with caged birds herbert consumptive and small country parish-bound wrote that struggle must be the same as resolution as faith itself while he suffocated in his sad minister ’ s bed for years arguing with god and himself it ’ s the uglier business willing yourself from despair to belief in those days i thought the saints robes heavy with must with ancient gnarled hands deserved the nothing they felt their way toward in those days my favorite saints were the ones who burned away young—i admired them in the cathedral paintings hooded eyes the brutal wings of their ribs gilt halos baroque frames what does it mean devotion mothers weep in the corners of those paintings while a man each morning sweeps the church floor
i ’ m tired of the gods i ’ m pious about the ancestors afloat in the wake widening behind me in time the restive devisers my father had one job from high school till he got fired at thirty the year was 1947 and his boss planning to run for mayor wanted to hire an italian veteran he explained putting it in plain english i was seven years old my sister was two the barbarian tribes in the woods were so savage the empire had to conquer them to protect and clear its perimeter so into the woods rome sent out missions of civilizing governors and invaders to establish schools courts garrisons soldiers clerks officials citizens with their household slaves years or decades or entire lives were spent out in the hinterlands— which might be good places to retire on a government pension especially if in those work-years you had acquired a native wife often i get these things wrong or at best mixed up but i do feel piety toward those persistent mixed families in gaul britain thrace when i die may i take my place in the wedge widening and churning in the mortal ocean of years of souls as i get it the roman colonizing and mixing the intricate imperial processes of enslaving and freeing involved not just the inevitable fucking in all senses of the word but also marriages and births as developers and barbers scribes and thugs mingled and coupled with the native people and peoples begetting and trading they needed to swap blend and improvise languages—couples especially needed to invent french spanish german and i confess— roman barbarian—i find that creole work more glorious than god the way it happened the school sent around a notice anybody interested in becoming an apprentice optician raise your hand it was the great depression anything about a job sounded good to milford pinsky who told me he thought it meant a kind of dentistry anyway he was bored sitting in study hall so he raised his hand and he got the job as was his destiny—full-time once he graduated joe schiavone was the veteran who took the job not a bad guy dr. vineburg did get elected mayor joe worked for him for years at the bank an episcopalian named john smock whose family owned a piece of the bank had played sports with milford he gave him a small loan with no collateral so he opened his own shop grinding lenses and selling glasses as his mother-in-law said “ almost a professional. ” optician comes from a greek word that has to do with seeing banker comes from an italian word for a bench where people sat i imagine and made loans or change pinsky like “ tex ” or “ brooklyn ” is a name nobody would have if they were still in that same place those names all signify someone who ’ s been away from home a while schiavone means “ a slav. ” milford is a variant on the names of poets— milton herbert sidney—certain immigrants gave their offspring creole comes from a word meaning to breed or to create in a place

when we arrive at the lounge of everything with our bags handfuls of earth the lives of our grandparents in our memory devices we expect an exchange of sorts that is what we expect and i think everyone deep down expects that we will not turn back through a high window we will connect stars like line drawings translate the sparkles of the poet we will sign the fascinating mouth of the speaker we will sing lyrics that someone thought were pretty good we will sing them and we will not turn back we will not when our footsteps awaken fresh from a long complicated journey during which the planet slid otherwise we will likely remember a dream we had once and tell a version of it to the next person and the next and realize hopefully they also have a dream to tell and we will not do that thing where we won ’ t listen to anyone else ’ s dream we will listen and interpret signing singing saying even though we have been instructed not to use ings we will use the wisdom disseminated by our devices we will not turn back we will not if on arrival there is wringing of hands we will shake hands and in the eye of a storm we will make tea with our brilliant fading bodies we will do a variety of things while we can we will bed down on the steps of the assembly if we have to we will bed down in a court of law and all beds anyway are temporary and when we see that and realize we have traveled through the night we have traveled and are not turning back that will be the point at which we will arrive

the guest who came in to the street people ’ s suppers last night an elderly man with a lost smart little boy ’ s face and a look as if he might turn against you anytime soon as if he ’ d just come into this world and he was extremely wary about what the world was going to be and he said “ if i ask you a question will you give me a truthful answer ” and i said “ that depends on what the question is ” thinking the little elderly boy looked sophisticated and as if he ’ d in fact been a long time in the world and would get the tone right and maybe he did or maybe he didn ’ t at any rate he went on to ask the question “ when i come into places like this and there are people holding coffee cups to their lips and they look at me are they about to drink the coffee or not to drink the coffee ” he was balancing the world on the tip of his witty unknowing nose i felt like i was falling down someplace else than anywhere there

it is pleasant very pleasant to sit at a wooden booth surrounded by parrots wheels right-turning conch shells the victory banner and the endless knot the lotus the treasure vase the golden fishes— is this not so is it not pleasant to sip tsingtao beer or zhujiang or yanjing and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats after we ’ ve drunk enough there will be buddhist delight mongolian beef side dishes a whole host of sauces even some pizza and chicken wings if children are present as well as the small ice-cream machine lotus paste pears smiles and bows all around it is pleasant is it not to linger outside the door that opens to the parking lot of this small strip mall beside this secondary road and look upon the scattered cars all come to rest here like boats in china floating on a quiet evening tide

from our deep cool verandah we spy on the world passing by we both wear glasses in order to pick out the details even as children we noticed all people would say dont like those twins they look at you funny we were reassured our powers had been confirmed but that was a long while ago now we are 60. we have lived in this ground floor flat on the main road for 20 years it is a very suitable dwelling and we have a satisfactory relationship with the landlord we think he is pleased we notice his transparency we have been here since we left our husbands who got in the way of our observations after our evening meal we talk quietly of what we have seen we believe in sharing our observations in case one of us has missed something for our eyesight isnt as sharp as it was ten years ago though we do clean our glasses each hour and keep our hair tied firmly back in small grey buns so nothing can distract our focus we are small women many people do not notice us while we are noticing them we keep to ourselves mother used to say to us never get too friendly with strangers they can harm you even if they smile and offer you an hour of their lives dont tell them nothing mother knew a lot she always kept the bible and a cloth to clean her hands on the kitchen table within reach at night we take turns to sit at the window and watch we set the alarm at 2 and 6. this way we both get some sleep theres always something to see along this road even at 3 in the morning last night we saw a woman in a torn fur coat gum boots and a beanie blow up balloons tie them on her arms as if they were wings she climbed up a tree spread her arms and jumped we think she might have injured herself she screamed for quite a while until one of the passing motorists stopped and rang for an ambulance we didnt want to get involved our slippers might have gotten wet it had been raining quite heavily another night one of the local drunks fell asleep on our verandah he smelt wretched but we were pleased to be able to get a closer look at him for several weeks we had been trying to work out a few things about him at least we were able to see how thick and long the scar on his bald head was we were able to read the words on his tattoos ‘ dearest jean ’ and ‘ sailor boy ’ we also saw a thin line thru the word ‘ jean ’ as if he had tried to cut the word out very interesting we scrubbed the verandah with disinfectant the next morning it didnt take long we keep records of our observations in a private code in large journals we are saving them up for the day when our memories fail us then we can read them thru to recall the details they are an assurance that our days have been full and busy we put black velvet covers on these books they are so soft to stroke just like the backs of our 8 black cats who often sleep like guardians in front of the cupboard as if they recognised the importance of its contents there are many folks with bad legs along this road they hobble ever so slowly up and down all day as if they had all the time in the world they bandage their legs in different ways some of the bandages are rather grubby you ’ d think theyd wash them there are plenty of laundromats around here every pension day they could wash them they could share a machine you can fit a good deal in one of these contraptions – at least ten bandages dear me if theyd looked where they were going instead of expecting life to do everything for them they wouldnt be in this predicament we ’ re so pleased we ’ re not handicapped we have only ourselves to thank and of course mother pension morning is always busy we always make sure the teapot is full by 9.30. the crowd gathers outside the bank for at least half an hour theres no time to get up and put the jug on for some time they clutter the footpath so many of them it takes a while for us to sort out who ’ s there we sometimes use the journal if we cant quite locate every face often its the only way to really know who died before the postman called on our deep cool verandah we sit the twins there are no mirrors in our hallway
“ if you work a body of water and a body of woman you can take fish out of one and children out of the other for the two kinds of survival the fishing is good both kinds are adequate in pleasures and yield but the hard work and the miseries are killing it is a good life if life is good if not not you are out in the world and in in the world having it both ways it is sportive and prevenient living combined although you have to think about the weathers and the hard work and the miseries are what i said it runs on like water quickly under the boat then slowly like the sand dunes under the house you survive by yourself by the one fish for a while and then by the other afterward when you run out you run out a hooky life baited with good times and whether the catch is caught or not is a question for those who go fishing for men or among them for things ”

there were so many books she had to separate them to avoid being overwhelmed by the excessive implications of their words she kept hundreds in a series of boxes inside a wire cage in a warehouse and hundreds more on the shelves of her various rooms when she changed houses she would pack some of the books into the boxes and exchange them for others that had been hibernating these resurrected books were precious to her for a while they had assumed the patinas of dusty chthonic wisdoms and thus she would let them sit on the shelves admiring them from a distance gathering time and air she did not want to be intimate with their insides the atmospherics suggested by the titles were enough sometimes she would increase the psychic proximities between herself and the books and place a pile of them on the floor next to her bed and quite possibly she absorbed their intentions while she slept if she intended travelling beyond a few hours she would occasionally remove a book from the shelves and place it in her bag she carried ‘ the poetics of space ’ round india for three months and it returned to her shelves undamaged at the completion of the journey every day of those three months she touched it and read some of the titles of its chapters to make sure it was there and real chapters called house and universe nests shells intimate immensity miniatures and the significance of the hut she had kept it in a pocket of her bag together with a coloured whistle and an acorn she now kept this book in the darkness of her reference shelf and she knew that one day she would have to admit to herself that this was the only book she had need of that this was the book she would enter the pages of that this was the book she was going to read

water irrigates my feet to sleep perchance to dream of winter in the village fat with its full complement of refugees returned to their own turf— unspringy as it is—in a strong surf of retrogressing

unmet at euston in a dream of london under turner ’ s steam misting the iron gantries i found myself running away from scotland into the golden city i ran down gray ’ s inn road and ran till i was under a black bridge this was me at nineteen late at night arriving between the buildings of the city of london and the i o i have fallen down fell in my dream beside the bank of england ’ s wall to be me with my money belt of northern ice i found eliot and he said yes and sprang into a holmes cab boswell passed me in the fog going to visit whistler who was with john donne who had just seen paul potts shouting on soho green midnight i hear the moon light chiming on st paul ’ s the city is empty night watchmen are drinking their tea the fire had burnt out the plague ’ s pits had closed and gone into literature between the big buildings i sat like a flea crouched in the stopped works of a watch
henri rouseeau 1897 in the heat of her dream she hears the iron kettle boiling its scuttle and hum as hurried as hoofbeats across a plain she drops in two guinea hens dancing in a ring round her skirts the children cheer “ auntie the english song ” lifting her lute she sings of the cat and the fiddle the cow jumping over the moon how the little ones hoot when the dish runs away with the spoon ah spoon—an uncloaked lute it waits to be strummed the temptation of london of paris of bumping along in the carriage with m. philippe in his top hat and greatcoat to visit the peacocks turquoise and gold and green each roaming the bois de boulogne with one hundred eyes she sleeps in the desert under a smiling full moon that shines in the teal night quiet behind her a lion stands tail erect having sniffed at her onyx flesh at the ribbony stripes his color-blindness darkens on her muslin dress all rainbow hues she is lost in a dream always happiest out of doors without shoes

for ben fenton-smith none are more familiar with dew than professional footballers from early grades they are used to running through practice drills and hurling their burly frames through rucks while the moist chaff of wet grass under the winter lights softens their fall accustoms the half- back to the slippery ball and writes green cuneiform on wet sandshoes and they fear it in the morning kicking off the dew in the ‘ twos ’ because they ignored a coach ’ s warning half their lives are spent in clouds of condensation or the cold heat of a winter sun where even the crowds seem like droplets on the concrete rose of the stadium in the final days of their season sweat-spangled on the eve of their triumph the ball on a string and their plays honed even the doubters believe and the last day is once again already an aftermath the ground ’ s been shaved and sucked dry by the noon sun and the paddock has become a paved and bristled hell for those who will collide with it and pinion flesh on earth earth on flesh and spill blood for the sake of the game possession is the law all are possessed and when the crowd melts into the dry darkness after that great red football ’ s booted between the uprights of the sky- scrapers and gone the sky bawls cheerless little drops for the victors and decks the oval with the losers ’ jewels
a man began to eat his order of fish and the ghost of the fish arose and spoke forgive me it said please hear me i died in despair which is as you know the worst of the deadly sins as i slowly suffocated in the alien air i gave up hope of salvation and so died without the consolation of religion in your compassion and mercy have a mass said for me and pray for my soul with that the ghost of the fish vanished and the man congratulating himself on possessing the carcass of such a remorseful creature tucked in

talking to my friend emily whose drinking patterns and extravagance of personal feeling are a lot like mine i ’ m pretty convinced when she explains the things we do while drinking a cocktail to celebrate the new account turns into a party that lasts till 3 a.m. and a terrific hangover indicate a problem of a sort i ’ d not considered i ’ ve been worried about how i metabolize the sauce for four years since my second bout of hepatitis when i kissed all the girls at christmas dinner and turned bright yellow christmas night but never about whether i could handle it it ’ s been more of a given the stage set for my life as an artistic queer as much of a tradition in these new york circles as incense for catholics or german shepherds for the blind we re-enact the rituals and our faces like smoky icons in a certain light seem to learn nothing but understand all it comforts me yet isn ’ t all that pleasant like drinking ripple to remember high school a friend of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades talking to the same types but progressively fewer blonds joe lesueur says he ’ s glad to have been a young man in the fifties with his tab hunter good looks because that was the image men desired now it ’ s the puerto rican angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity that springs out of machismo rather than a moral choice his argument is pretty convincing too except lots of the pretty blonds i ’ ve known default by dying young leaving the field to the swarthy cameron burke the dancer and waiter at magoo ’ s killed on his way home from the pines when a car hit his bike on the sunrise highway henry post dead of aids a man i thought would be around forever surprising me by his mortality the way i was surprised when i heard he was not the grandson of emily post at all just pretending like the friend he wrote about in playgirl blair meehan was faking when he crashed every a list party for a year by pretending to be kay meehan ’ s son a masquerade that ended when a hostess told him “ your mother ’ s here ” and led him by the hand to the dowager—woman behold thy son—underneath a darkening conviction that all if not wrong was not right by now henry may have faced the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky stay as outrageously nasty as you were and patrick mack locked into memory as he held court in the anvil by the downstairs pinball machine and writhing as he danced in lita hornick ’ s parlor when the stimulators played her party dead last week of causes i don ’ t know as if the cause and not the effect were the problem my blond friend chuck shaw refers to the bone- crusher in the sky and i ’ m starting to imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods flickering on at twilight as i used to do in the years when i crashed more parties and acted more outrageously and met more beauties and made more enemies than ever before or ever again i pray it ’ s spring and there ’ s another crop of kids with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self-esteem from my arrival in new york who plug into the history of prettiness convincing to themselves and the devout we who are about to catch the eye of someone new salute as the cotillion passes led by blonds and followed by the rest of us a formal march to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia that hides the trash sprout magically at our approach i toast it as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent as a blond in love my clothes smell like the smoky bar but the sweetness of the april air ’ s delicious when i step outside and fill my lungs leaning my head back in a first-class seat on the shuttle between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds to come and an enormous irish wake in which the corpses change but the party goes on forever

there 's a certain sadness to this body of water adjacent to the runway its reeds and weeds handful of ducks the water color manmade a still life and still life 's a cold exercise in looking back back to florida craning my neck like a sandhill crane in alachua basin as for the scrub oaks the hot wind in the leaves was language spanish moss—dusky parasitic— an obsession i wanted to live in it one professor in exile did covered himself in the stuff as a joke— then spent a week removing mites that's enough the fields of rushes lay filled with water and i said farewell my high ship an old red volvo dl gone to another coast another peninsula one without sleep or amphibious music tonight in flight from san francisco— because everything is truer at a remove— i watch the man i love watch the turn of the sacramento river then sacramento lit city of legislation and flat land i think of florida how flat i think of forgetting florida and then the landscape grows black
it came to pass that i boarded a plane and as i edged past the man in the aisle seat he said my name is dov i knew you would come so dov came to pass and then the next thing came to pass which was the plane which fell through the air so that all felt and understood the word “ slew. ” we held the hands of those next to us dov ’ s hand dov who knew i would come the hand of my son who said hang on i ’ ll just finish listening to this song and it came to pass that in those seconds of fall we entered the deluge zone which was dark and dangerous and it came to pass that we thought things we hadn ’ t thought before and understood things that couldn ’ t be said out loud or even in our quiet pulpy insides we understood that children sucked life from their mothers then led it back in in mysterious ways we understood that men damaged children in shocking unspeakable ways and in quiet secretive ways and in silence and murk somehow dandelions marjoram thistle and thrush came to pass and a bank teller named “ snow. ” and then it came to pass that we turned away from where we were headed because the wind there was too strong to land safely on one engine we turned away from the wind bothering the trees flaying pansies knocking lemons one against another away from hymns ancient and modern from the holes dug in the garden for kitchen scraps that resemble graves prepared for a succession of small animals away we turned back to a runway on which waited emergency vehicles and so it came to pass that we touched ground whole feeling lucky and afraid being out of danger it came to pass that we broke the chain of hands that held us though not the chain of thoughts — that held and held and led us to the tightly fenced park where bodies lie decomposing terrifying yet natural faces slurred into earth and to the deer who come and delicately nuzzle bone
what song will they play if i don ’ t come home tonight i wished someone would write a song for me then someone did but it was a song berating me it was called “ actually ashleigh ” and i think of the cruelty of songwriters as i get ready — how their music makes their words sound better than they really are how our feelings make music seem better than it really is and how the difficulty of getting ready is a pure bitter difficulty like calculus in the back row a once-promising student cries what will my face become strings of demi-semi quavers i partition the day into a wall of smaller more manageable days each of which goes black as i billow past in my bike pants and cleats and i see i am not getting ready at all if anything i am getting unready i am trying to be made lovely by the glow of an adshel in the rain in youth we are told we will rise up whole from our baths from the comforting midwinter soup of our sadness we will not devour ourselves tonight the dark broth will always drain from us our legs will drain from our bodies and into the ground and our footsteps will pour into the future but the future is hidden under thick nests of fat beneath the streets it pours out to sea gently warming the earth and its creatures i go down there as i get ready and the air turns over gently exposing its soft underbelly my going-out clothes are waiting for me ironed smooth laid out like a disappearance
in the warmth of night i put feet to my plan waited for my brothers to sleep they ’ d spent the day sharpening their hooks repairing the great net filling gourds with fresh water they ’ d bundled taro wrapped in leaves sitting below the cross seats the bundles and the net would cover me especially if i said the chant to slow my movement and my breathing the moon became brighter like a big fish eye as the chant hooked me i was holding my grandmother ’ s hook so tightly a little cut welled red between my closed knuckles “ goodmorning brothers ” i called and they cussed and moaned until the next chant took us a further hundred miles and then another until my chanting made them gasp as we settled on a patch of ocean black with fish they forgave me not that it matters i took the bloody hook and said my business to the ocean it worked the fish rose and our descent was secured
in the hermetic almost dark under the fluorescent dizz i found her broken nerves smoke coming off the dashes the caps like jolts to the neck the pried-open spaces between vowels where the teeth bit off twine and the tongue was raw then cool with ice the air of the stockroom after lunch was the marbleized silence of the small blank pages she stitched into privacy air of paper and faint glue bond carbon graph yellow pads in the stockroom i could read alone— the confetti of money dissolved on the blank wall after work i slid the numbered poems on blue mimeo into my playbook and felt the open field the zig-zagging past cornerbacks the white lines skewed to heaven excuse my mood—unbridled chemical her scrawled messages smooth to the mind excuse my absence again and yes then too— the cold stone of the palisades was there after we split— alone naked in the hudson the water greasing me in the tepid chemical mix before i returned to the cement of 9w in my father ’ s skylark the night black and soundless within
it was the summer of 1976 when i saw the moon fall down it broke like a hen ’ s egg on the sidewalk the garden roiled with weeds hummed with gnats who settled clouds on my oblivious siblings a great hunger insatiate to find a dulcet ill an evil sweetness blind a gush of yolk and then darker somewhere a streetlamp disclosed the insides of a chevy impala—vinyl seats the rear- view headrests and you your hand through your hair an indistinguishable burning failing bliss because the earth ’ s core was cooling all animals felt the urge to wander wash down this whisper of you the terrible must maybe the core wasn ’ t cooling but i felt a coolness in my mother that girl was shining me on in blue crayon the bug-bitten siblings printed lyrics on the walls of my room i wrote the word lava on my jeans it must be the night fever i sang with the 8-track but the moon had not broken on the sidewalk the moon was hot bright as a teakettle whistling outside my door tied up in sorrow lost in my song if you don ’ t come back and that serious night cooled settling like sugar on our lawn i wrote the word sugar on my palms i shall say what inordinate love is the moon rose itself up on its elbows and shook out its long hair
the sudden thuck of landing the arrow made in the mark of the center lifted and loosened his skin and so he stood hearing it like many thrusting breaths driven to ground he abandoned the long light flight of arrows and the slow parabolas bows dream of for the swifter song beyond flesh song of moments the earth turned its molten balance he stood hearing it again the precise shudder the arrow sought and returned to flaming
the guys who drank quarts of busch last night here by the backstop of this baseball diamond had names given them by their mothers and fathers— “ jack ” and “ kenny ” let us say jack might be a skinny guy in a black fake-leather jacket he ’ s twenty-five his gray pants are too loose on his hips his jaws always have these little black extra hairs his mother won ’ t talk to him on the phone she lives on french fries and ketchup he hasn ’ t been able to send her any cash in the last two years ever since he lost his job unloading produce trucks at pathmark jack ’ s father disappeared when he was ten “ no big deal ” jack says “ he was a bastard anyway he used to flatten beer cans on the top of my head. ” kenny offers a laugh-noise he ’ s heard all that before kenny is forty-eight a flabby man with reddened skin he is employed at the italian market selling fish just four hours a day but his shirts hold the smell his female companion deena left him a note last month “ you owe me 12 chocolate 31 wine 55 cable tv plus donuts—i have had it—taking lamp and mirror they are mine. ” kenny hasn ’ t seen her since he hangs with jack because jack talks loud as if the world of cops and people with full-time jobs could be kept at bay by talking talking loud i ’ m talking gently and imaginatively here as if the world of bums and jerks could be kept far off— jack and kenny or two other guys dark to me with wounds oozing in philadelphia ways less ready to narrate last night at midnight they got cheesesteaks at casseloni ’ s and bought four quarts at the fireside tavern and wandered into this park after one quart of busch jack said he was lenny dykstra and found a stick for his bat “ pitch to me asshole ” he said so kenny went to the mound and pitched his bottle for want of anything better and jack swung in the dark and missed kenny ’ s bottle smashed on home plate and jack heard in the sound the absurdity of all his desiring since seventh grade absurdity of a skinny guy who blew everything since seventh when he hit home runs and chased joan rundle around the gym so jack took his own empty bottle and smashed it down amid the brown shards of kenny ’ s bottle then they leaned on the backstop to drink the other two quarts and they both grew glum and silent and when they smashed these bottles it was like what else would they do next morning nick and i come to the park with a rubber ball and a miniature bat nick is not quite three but he knows the names of all the phillies starters and he knows the area around home plate is not supposed to be covered with jagged pieces of brown glass like a good dad i warn him not to touch it and we decide to establish a new home plate closer to the mound there ’ s no trash can handy “ who put that glass there ” nick wants to know and to make a long story short i say “ bad people. ” nick says “ bad how come ”
in memory 1929-2004 we choose a cheap hotel because they ’ re serving drinks we drink i hear him tell a tale or two he thinks that so-and-so ’ s a sleaze and then there was the time that milosz phoned oh please another gin with lime i want to say that once i saw him dressed in leather leaning on a fence inside a bar rather walking to the n i gush about his books he gives his change to men who ’ ve lost their homes and looks how like him i ’ ve been told our day together done i hug him in the cold and then the train is gone
imagine cities you ’ ve inhabited streets paved in lava stone you never intended to pray in the temples had nothing to sell now imagine yourself returning to those same cities hunt for people you knew knock on their doors ask yourself where are the vases animals etched in gold where are the wines from distant places banquets ferreted from the bowels of the earth while you were missing other people wore your garments slept in your bed how frightening the man who said in his affliction wood has hope cut down it will flourish if the root grows old and the trunk withers in dust at the scent of water it will germinate
the connection between divorced fathers and pizza crusts is understandable the divorced father does not cook confidently he wants his kid to enjoy dinner the entire weekend is supposed to be fun kids love pizza for some reason involving soft warmth and malleability kids approve of melted cheese on pizza years before they will tolerate cheese in other situations so the divorced father takes the kid and the kid 's friend out for pizza the kids eat much faster than the dad before the dad has finished his second slice the kids are playing a video game or being ace ventura or blowing spitballs through straws making this hail that ca n't quite be cleaned up there are four slices left and the divorced father does n't want them wasted there has been enough waste already he sits there in his windbreaker finishing the pizza it 's good except the crust is actually not so great— after the second slice the crust is basically a chore— so you leave it you move on to the next loaded slice finally there you are amid rims of crust all this is understandable there 's no dark conspiracy meanwhile the kids are having a pretty good time which is the whole point so the entire evening makes clear sense now the divorced father gathers the sauce-stained napkins for the trash and dumps them and dumps the rims of crust which are not corpses on a battlefield understandability fills the pizza shop so thoroughly there 's no room for anything else now he 's at the door summoning the kids and they follow of course they do he 's a dad
five more books in a box to be carried out to the car your office door closes behind you and at that moment you turn invisible—not even a ghost in that hall from the hall ’ s point of view if the halls don ’ t know you the halls and the rooms of the buildings where you worked for seven years— if the halls don ’ t know you and they don ’ t— some new woman or two new men come clattering down these halls in the month after your departure indeed just two days after you left forever they come clattering with ideas about the relation between mind and body or will and fate filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them accept them as if there is a belonging in the world— but these new workers are wrong the halls don ’ t know who is working under the unobtrusive fluorescent panels this is appalling and for a minute you are appalled though your being so now is not an event in the life of your new rented house or even your new condominium so if they don ’ t if they don ’ t know you the halls the walls the fixtures then what then there is for you no home in that rock no home in the mere rock of where you work where you briskly walk not even in the bed where your body sleeps alone or not— so if there is to be a place for you for you it must not be located in plaster and tile and space it will have to be in that other house the one whose door you felt opening just last night when you dialed from memory and your friend picked up the phone

one cuts blocks from the abundant river hauls them house to house one falls unseen the heart inoculated cold against a sky still moving moving even now above the river the canal willows shimmering across the water muskrats diving out of reach the river whispers till it freezes— a body twirling sluggishly beneath the surface as again one stack then spreads the straw another falters slips or puts a sliver on your tongue to feel it melting there— the ice-lit underworld of someone else
we must stop bragging there are limits for us to the cold and the twelfth night marks them all just off the coast of maine the lobster boats pass dragging their nets capsize once in a while in water like that you die that ’ s all that water isn ’ t even frozen not even frozen and that ’ s as cold as it gets the hearts of birds beat voraciously so they keep warm so if you put out a feeder keep it full of the seeds their hearts feed on then it is only when their food runs out that you find them inexpressibly taut in hollows and that ’ s as cold as it ever gets
i find i am descending in a propeller plane upon pasco in the state of washington i accept this i have reasons for participating in the experiential sequence that has brought me here down below the land is printed with huge circles doubtless an irrigation system doubtless it makes sense there are people who understand it living with dignity in square houses and the result possibly is one billion radishes now some so-called time has passed this nation is a huge nation in which the infinity of for example washington state is just one segment of an even less thinkable hugeness and yet zim zim zim zim united airlines has me here in my eastern metropolis with its ten thousand makers of third-rate pizza uncannily far from the possible radishes of washington state the taxi driver experiments with narrow streets to shorten our detour caused by sports fans and he says the eagles will out-tough the steelers i defer to his judgment i am conserving my powers after “ a while ” i have this unsettlingly smooth tuna salad with a pale pickle in a drugstore designed by dwight d. eisenhower reading a few poems by david rivard i have thoughts i have my uncle ralph ’ s jacket soft and droopy giving me a sense of the past the rain out there on the roofs of retail outlets is saying no guarantee and in a way i am nowhere in another way maybe definitely not in a wide wet parking lot i turn back toward the store to explain to the cashier that she charged me for six cans of seltzer when in fact i only had one from a six-pack but the idea of justice seems so fatiguing i would rather read a surprisingly serious detective novel so i vibrate with indecision in the parking lot till all the car windows rattle imperceptibly then an alleged interval ostensibly intervenes at the mall a woman at a piano has played 1800 songs from memory according to the radio personality who stands with a mike explaining her bid for the guinness book of records i am walking away at an unplanned angle singing “ tiny montgomery ” which i bet she wouldn ’ t have been ready to play i have this inner life i think of my father lonely in vermont i think of myself lonely in syracuse and my old poem about a detective who can ’ t solve his biggest case and as a result i have feelings—but my teacher said the future of american poetry can ’ t be merely the notation of sensibility when he said that i felt a chilly fear at the edge of consc-consc-consc-consciousness like an ice cube in the corner of my stomach that ’ s how i felt so then so then consequently i thought “ i must gather up some serious ideas ” but then ashberry phoned and left a message after the beep “ don ’ t be a sucker ideas are where it isn ’ t. ” this made my throat get sort of dry so i drank a classic coke and then another classic coke two hours later as time so-to-say passed what was always there texture that ’ s what how it was/is the how of how when i pick up my color prints at the camera shop the disappointment i always feel is actually a blessing is it not i can say “ i ’ ll go along with this charade until i can think my way out ” even though i ’ ll never think my way out i ’ ve come this far that day in 1971 i hitchhiked all the way to montpelier didn ’ t i and here i am suddenly i have a son who focuses with tremendous insistence upon dogs balloons air conditioners hats clocks and noses to him i convey that the world is okay life is good we accept it your dad is a little mixed up but your shoes got tied right as barbara cohen in high school said about politics it ’ s interesting giving the word four earnest syllables in-ter-est-ing
it was a beach like all beaches only perhaps more beautiful and the sand was pink not red we would arrive in caravans hampers overflowing with food and drink like aziz and his party on the way to malabar the colonials and their servants away on an outing we would stop under thatch umbrellas towels and tablecloths spread out against the sea my mother in her skirted swim suit surrounded by fathers of other children her olive skin lit through her straw hat they would laugh and drink beer and leer while the children did the usual beach things boring futile tunnels to china running at waves and then away daring each other to be swallowed i would go out by the forbidden rocks and pick off oysters then give them to the men to pry open cover with lime juice and suck dry once i saw my mother sucking an oyster out of another daddy ’ s hand her dappled face bobbed and smiled and her tongue searched the shell for pearls

sam paused on the stairs he had forgotten a thing in leland ’ s room a copy of thomas merton lay on the floor the air was full of gnats of possibility what was the story sam looked at the clock twice the day was dropping softly away while sam ’ s sneakers made the wood stairs creak the wood was sure it was wood alice got home from the store the bags had to be unloaded as the day went and went then the sundown kitchen grew quiet sam crossed his legs one way then the other way he had chosen purple corduroys they were pants of the day one possibility on the tilted table sat the damaged typewriter what about thomas merton did he know the central story someone was quietly reading by the fireplace but not sam next day there was badminton with the troubled carpenter and the story of an awful egg salad causing laughter but sam had forgotten some thing then alice brought in the brownies and minor pleasure colored the house and there went the evening j.j. came downstairs all gleamy from her bath she had three reasons to get downtown fast sam picked up a novel by sukenick the clue must be nearby between sam and the page swarmed the gnats of possibility leland stowed his bicycle in the basement and came upstairs with a point about capitalism look at the time said someone where was j.j. now where was the story under the red chair lay the newspaper whose relevance was all mystery or not mystery enough then alice went out to see a movie some man meets some woman with big eyes on a jet and changes his whole life for her disastrously but thrillingly alice told about it briefly and went to make tea sam paused on the hard wooden stairs j.j. was gone she was gone leland was eating yogurt at midnight the whole brown house was floating gliding very smoothly for some reason with sam not clear whether the gliding was a story and if so was it central and was it his

as i was going down impassive rivers i no longer felt myself guided by haulers yelping redskins had taken them as targets and had nailed them naked to colored stakes i was indifferent to all crews the bearer of flemish wheat or english cottons when with my haulers this uproar stopped the rivers let me go where i wanted into the furious lashing of the tides more heedless than children 's brains the other winter i ran and loosened peninsulas have not undergone a more triumphant hubbub the storm blessed my sea vigils lighter than a cork i danced on the waves that are called eternal rollers of victims ten nights without missing the stupid eye of the lighthouses sweeter than the flesh of hard apples is to children the green water penetrated my hull of fir and washed me of spots of blue wine and vomit scattering rudder and grappling-hook and from then on i bathed in the poem of the sea infused with stars and lactescent devouring the azure verses where like a pale elated piece of flotsam a pensive drowned figure sometimes sinks where suddenly dyeing the blueness delirium and slow rhythms under the streaking of daylight stronger than alcohol vaster than our lyres the bitter redness of love ferments i know the skies bursting with lightning and the waterspouts and the surf and the currents i know the evening and dawn as exalted as a flock of doves and at times i have seen what man thought he saw i have seen the low sun spotted with mystic horrors lighting up with long violet clots resembling actors of very ancient dramas the waves rolling far off their quivering of shutters i have dreamed of the green night with dazzled snows a kiss slowly rising to the eyes of the sea the circulation of unknown saps and the yellow and blue awakening of singing phosphorous i followed during pregnant months the swell like hysterical cows in its assault on the reefs without dreaming that the luminous feet of the marys could constrain the snout of the wheezing oceans i struck against you know unbelievable floridas mingling with flowers panthers eyes and human skin rainbows stretched like bridal reins under the horizon of the seas to greenish herds i have seen enormous swamps ferment fish-traps where a whole leviathan rots in the rushes avalanches of water in the midst of a calm and the distances cataracting toward the abyss glaciers suns of silver nacreous waves skies of embers hideous strands at the end of brown gulfs where giant serpents devoured by bedbugs fall down from gnarled trees with black scent i should have liked to show children those sunfish of the blue wave the fish of gold the singing fish —foam of flowers rocked my drifting and ineffable winds winged me at times at times a martyr weary of poles and zones the sea whose sob created my gentle roll brought up to me her dark flowers with yellow suckers and i remained like a woman on her knees ... resembling an island tossing on my sides the quarrels and droppings of noisy birds with yellow eyes and i sailed on when through my fragile ropes drowned men sank backward to sleep now i a boat lost in the foliage of caves thrown by the storm into the birdless air i whose water-drunk carcass would not have been rescued by the monitors and the hanseatic sailboats free smoking topped with violet fog i who pierced the reddening sky like a wall bearing delicious jam for good poets lichens of sunlight and mucus of azure who ran spotted with small electric moons a wild plank escorted by black seahorses when julys beat down with blows of cudgels the ultramarine skies with burning funnels i who trembled hearing at fifty leagues off the moaning of the behemoths in heat and the thick maelstroms eternal spinner of the blue immobility i miss europe with its ancient parapets i have seen sidereal archipelagos and islands whose delirious skies are open to the sea-wanderer —is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself million golden birds o future vigor – but in truth i have wept too much dawns are heartbreaking every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter acrid love has swollen me with intoxicating torpor o let my keel burst o let me go into the sea if i want a water of europe it is the black cold puddle where in the sweet-smelling twilight a squatting child full of sadness releases a boat as fragile as a may butterfly no longer can i bathed in your languor o waves follow in the wake of the cotton boats nor cross through the pride of flags and flames nor swim under the terrible eyes of prison ships
i oh the huge avenues of the holy land the terraces of the temple what has happened to the brahmin who taught me the proverbs from then and from there i can still see even the old women i remember silvery hours and sun near rivers the hand of the country on my shoulder and our caresses as we stood in the fiery fields —a flight of red pigeons thunders around my thoughts—in exile here i had a stage on which to perform the dramatic masterpieces of all literatures i might tell you about unheard-of wealth i follow the story of the treasures you found i see the next chapter my wisdom is as neglected as chaos is what is my void compared with the stupefaction awaiting you ii i am a far more deserving inventor than all those who went before me a musician in fact who found something resembling the key of love at present a noble from a meager countryside with a dark sky i try to feel emotion over the memory of mendicant childhood over my apprenticeship when i arrived wearing wooden shoes polemics five or six widowings and a few wild escapades when my strong head kept me from rising to the same pitch as my comrades i don ’ t miss what i once possessed of divine happiness the calm of this despondent countryside gives a new vigor to my terrible scepticism but since this scepticism can no longer be put into effect and since i am now given over to a new worry—i expect to become a very wicked fool iii in an attic where at the age of twelve i was locked up i knew the world and illustrated the human comedy in a wine cellar i learned history at some night celebration in a northern city i met all the wives of former painters in an old back street in paris i was taught the classical sciences in a magnificent palace surrounded by all the orient i finished my long work and spent my celebrated retirement i have invigorated my blood i am released from my duty i must not even think of that any longer i am really from beyond the tomb and without work

somebody who would never refuse money told me this— about the syncretic effect when each person plugs their attention into a field to read ad copy let ’ s just say they become opened up and other beings can see into their minds this was considered a science fiction idea to many people but not to me in my negative space construction is always occurring the liftoff from awful to tolerable to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful has been my most difficult task to swing but swing i will there ’ s nothing else to do i live here and being here and hearing myself or my mind ’ s divide through others convinces me that i must do everything i can to save us from the pit that is until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows you may have a tree of your own—you may have a home in your own tree congratulations if you write an instructive pamphlet you can bet i will read it i do not want to go out in darkness i am doing everything i know to prevent this and thank you by the way if you ’ ve written a pamphlet the shared information system and each being at the end of its screen emits an led light emitting diode on an often green screen—you say i should give my father up to the authorities you blame your circumstances on my choice—but it ’ s the authorities who did this to him how do you think a person loses his mind he let someone take it he is sort of my mind and you are too god help me the green screen is an ingenious discovery you can record events in a studio before the screen and then key in whatever environment you like it ’ s a special color chroma green but it can be blue too the experience of things is determined by our feelings about them information is colored by us you may see remotely in a photograph for instance the image of an ambush victim maybe it is a war and/or she is caught naked if she is unhappy—indicated by face and body arrangement—you may feel that some people will hate the state of things that made her so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it how do you find her what guns surround her country and after all maybe she would hate it to have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation she may only be thinking about humiliation that is a tough feeling to shake then and i need not go too far into this then there are those who see the pain of someone and they just love it this may have something to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound the wound they think is everyone else ’ s fault and they can not forgive this is only information in the form of speculation some feelings you get when you consider “ what if this happened to me ” and you will want to remedy the situation to secure yourself from the negative condition of it together humans create one body—the planet earth and its projections the things in the stomach affect what goes on in the head on the web many people make money with miracle potions some curb the human appetite some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want i heard the other girl refer to me as a skull she was very angry and did not look or say hello there is a prevalent competitive notion that each only has one place that her face is only hers and that i don ’ t have a face or to her it is death this she reads as me—the death of her obviously i am not i write and read and then roll on i wear an ordinary human face some could compare me to a bird of prey because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long and i like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back i am not here to attack you are also a mutant do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you do you think you can go to sleep here and wake up the same the screen is framed by plastic beneath that you use words to issue commandments or call-outs most people use the web to send messages to people who are already their friends they make arrangements for later and detail what happened in the past this information may be not true the web can not know intention it records and is open to influence people make money through advertisements or so they think—well selling ads that ’ s quantifiable— if ads make money that is more difficult to know unless there are special offers the web is full of special offers and 30-day trials if you fall for those or i should say if you respond to the offer what often happens is that your information is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox with offers that which is known as spam because you are someone who wants to look great and there are other companies with products compatible with your stated desire ways for you to achieve the prevailing notion of beauty it is my job to tell you the models are selected because they are physically improbable they are elevated to be made desirable their desirability is physical because they are models if it were easy to be like that they would not be sought-after by manufacturers generally working people need to be sturdy advertisers want to make money they go with psychology and so create a sort of self-rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people they know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form no matter what station they are from everyone wants to be beautiful everyone wants to be the agreed-upon beautiful thing probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside if not outside you can create an excellent argument for your being and improve upon ability that is my opinion if you live alone you may know how great the web can be on it there is information and pornography information includes the prospects pornography is the biggest industry in america it is designed to bring about a certain state of arousal generally couched in anger that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to without worrying about the one fucked pornography is addictive for many of course sometimes people want to touch to hear a voice to imagine a partner and what they can do together the web has many dating services my ex-psychiatrist advised me against trying them she had transferred the daughter role onto me i do appreciate the dangers of strangers i am prepared with the information that pictures are not people in both obvious and non-obvious ways i know at least three people who have been in love with people they met online each one is intelligent and down-to-earth i ’ ve gleaned from their descriptions of online courting that the early questions are essential that and no expectation and somehow you have to withhold your own personal information that is until you meet up in a non-threatening place you will have to have someone know where you are a point person and you will need a defense mace for instance or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby or in the car it will be important for him or her to know you have a dog they should meet each other as soon as possible this is the magic of the machine the meeting and love trial and if it works the love made well that really is amazing objectively amazing and good for the machine good for the machine the electric web courses heavily through me this may be how we make history we can put up our movies our words or costume dramas we say we are so and so and people follow the saga do you ever get the problem which is opposite to the problem of the watcher have you ever only seen yourself through other people or

—for my students breakfast and i ’ m eating plain yogurt figs from my garden and honey i ’ m sitting in a lawn chair on the backyard patio— life is good and the sunlight warming my lap and the pages of a book remind me of tucson and the subterranean apartment i rented alone and far from home there was a sofa in front of my one window where at noon the sun burned briefly on the cushions as starlings stirred in the trees with their admonishments stepping back there now i remember feeling hopeless after reading lorca ’ s “ lament for ignacio sánchez mejías. ” i recall how i put the book on the coffee table and closed my eyes and saw blood glowing in my arteries in the leaves the starlings went on with their disconnected chatter and i said to myself “ i ’ ll never write anything like ‘ and the bull alone with a high heart at five o ’ clock in the afternoon. ’ ” for three months i didn ’ t write one word but instead passed the days swimming in the public pool where from my half-closed eyes i watched light ride the splashing water or resting on the surface when i floated face down sinking with fear “ what do i do now ” i asked some nights i filled my red truck with gas and drove west on the 19 until my headlights flooded the desert and when the city was less than pinpoints of glitter and when all i could hear was the whine of silence in my ears i parked alongside the highway leaned against my pickup and stared at stars so sure of themselves as they shone that i believed they couldn ’ t help but give me something that would make me sit at my desk and write i felt directionless and wanted to walk out into the landscape but i feared snakes and scorpions hiding in the buckhorn and staghorn as i recalled my father ’ s words “ you ’ ll be lost forever on the far side of the moon ” — words that haunted me as i imagined slipping into lunar shadows that no human telescope would spot as i wandered lost and ripped with nostalgia for the nights i read in used bookstores on campbell—a time when the future seemed so clear i smelled it in dirt that somebody rinsed from the sidewalk as i walked home then one night while sipping black coffee along the side of the 19 i remembered lying on the living room floor as my father and i listened to brahms ’ s “ lullaby ” which inspired me to practice “ away in a manger ” on my trumpet “ it ’ s a lullaby play it like that ” my father said as my sixth grade lips struggled to phrase notes that would please a child under the beating stars and remembering this i looked up to the oblivious heavens and tied words to images—cassiopeia perseus cygnus pegasus— and let them sing clearly through my mind

lucy doolin first day on the job stroked his goatee and informed the seven of us in his charge his name was short for lucifer and that his father a man he never knew had been possessed as his mother had told him of both an odd sense of humor and a deep and immitigable bitterness also that the same man had named lucy ’ s twin brother born dead jesus christ these facts he said along with his tattoos and mohawked black hair we should in our toils on his behalf remember as we should also always remember to call him only by that otherwise most womanly diminutive and never he warned by his given nor surname least of all with the title “ mister ” attached which would remind him of that same most hated father and plunge him therefore into a mood he could not promise he would he said “ behave appropriately within. ” fortunately our job unlike the social difficulties attached thereto was simple collect the trash from the county ’ s back roads although given lucy ’ s insistence on thoroughness this meant not only beer cans and bottles all manner of cast-off paper and plastics but also the occasional condom too as well as the festering roadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tar with a square-bladed shovel all of which was to be tossed into the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselves rode to and from the job in by fifty-yard increments then we traveled he was never not smoking a cigarette late every afternoon at the dump while we unloaded our tonnage of trash he sat with stump mccarriston sexton of the dump and the dump ’ s constant resident in the shade next to a green decrepit trailer we marveled at and strangely envied since every inch of wall we could see through the open door was plastered with fold-outs and pages from every stump-salvaged playboy and nudie magazine he had ever found among the wreckage there stump we understood was the ugliest man on earth even had lucy not told us so we would have known by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yards of his hovel that he never bathed and once while we shoveled and scraped he took up the .22 from the rack beside his door and popped with amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us then walked to their carcasses skinned them out and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rack to dry he was making lucy explained a rat hide coat we could see come the fall except for school as for school it was a concept stump could not fathom and lucy had no use for on the truck ’ s dash all that summer robert burton ’ s anatomy of melancholy a tome he said he ’ d read already eleven times this summer being the twelfth we thought in some way it might have had to do with something like the gallery stump ’ s trailer contained the first word of its title meaning something to us the last nothing at all there were things about men we might be unable ever to know which we somehow knew was lucky and lucky incidentally was the name of the cat fat and mangy that once stump was back in the shade with lucy began one by one to consume the hideless rats the town we came from was sinking into the emptiness of a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it and rats were more common than hares and universally despised they shamed us it seemed as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity— the bodies of those women on the walls the provenance of rats the very earth offered up like a plague the burden of a name like lucifer or stump whose name as it was scrawled on his mailbox seemed to be stumplin reilly mccarriston esquire of the seven of us one would die in vietnam one after medical school would hang himself from a beam in his parents ’ basement the others merely gone vanished in actuality if not in memory leaving me alone to tell this story how stump would spend his last twenty years in prison having shot lucy—one slender flattening .22 slug through the forehead—as he stood fifty feet away balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer arms extended like jesus christ said stump whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itself even before the trial and who no doubt by some court-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself was forced to bathe and shave to step into the unknown country of a scentless white shirt and black businessman ’ s trousers in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense that lucifer—mr doolin as the court insisted—had told him to

god put his finger on my sacrum and he lifted me he set me in the center of the universe the curious desire of my chronically lonely life it was cold and dark and lonely and i was scared there were no accessories i burst into tears over nothing what would jimmy schuyler do wwjsd and as quietly as the sound of kleenex being pulled from a box i sneezed and morning that goddess as if she were slightly deaf barely lifted her head off the horizon before laying back down and a rose opened her portals and the scent ran up an elephant ’ s trunk or tried to such a long way for everything to travel from here i look like a front moving in an icy purple light a poet would say belonged to a perfume stopper belonging to his mother when it was her nipple you know neither in the past or in the future

is all wrong ed what poets now live where they say they do where they started out where they want to half the midwesterners did time in new york the other half in california only new yorkers write as if they are from new york and mostly they are not the ones in california were wounded elsewhere when they feel better or ca n't afford the rent they 'll go back where they came from this is america you get hurt where you are born you make poetry out of it as far from home as you can get you die somewhere in between the only geography of poets is greyhound general motors rules them all ubi patria ibi bene or ibi bene ubi patria bread out of nostalgia not a lot of it either some of us came from very far maps do n't help much

i think it is interesting though not exactly amusing how we go from day to day with no money how do we do it friends ask suspecting we really have some stash stacked away somewhere but we certainly do not and we also do not know how we do it either you sure are lucky some of our friends say i am none too sure of that though as i wait for the winning lottery numbers to be announced on cklw thursday in detroit is the day of dreams we have been dreaming of a place in the country lately and i ’ m none too sure that is very healthy and speaking of health that ’ s also been a problem that probably has something to do with no money since we ’ ve all been sick lately taking turns politely of course could you bring me some more tea one of us will ask and the other will in between the coughing and worrying our thoughts have often turned to crime we seriously wonder how we can get away with a bundle with as little risk as possible last week we took our last 12 out of the bank and noticed how much more they had there though we had none of course we wouldn ’ t rob that bank they know us there as the ones who bring the rolls of pennies in and just yesterday they fish-eyed us for trying to cash our son ’ s xmas bond from his grandparents after only one month so we wouldn ’ t try to rob that bank but i do know of one up north that may be possible i know this just seems like romantic dreaming but i practically make a career of reading detective stories and god knows i have no other anyway if the right opportunity comes along we are more than ready to meet it but this is a time of waiting the i ching says though it does not say how we are to eat while waiting and soon we will have another mouth to feed— ann now in her seventh month and that is often in our thoughts besides all that we are both over thirty artist and poet still waiting to cross the great water meanwhile day after day there is still detroit to be dealt with — a small pond says our friend snee big fish we used to answer him but that was a while back now we think maybe lake erie is the great water referred to in the i ching and if we wait long enough we can walk across — to buffalo or cleveland in a healthy person says the philosopher self-pity can be a forerunner to action once the problem is seen clearly a solution may be found at hand and as i said i think it is interesting though not exactly amusing

for i have seen love and his face is choice heart of hearts a flesh of pure fire fusing from the center where all motion is one and i have known despair that the face has ceased to stare at me with the rose of the world but lies furled in an artificial paradise it is hell to get into if i knew you were there i would fall upon my knees and plead to god to deliver you in my arms once again but it is senseless to try one can only take means to reduce misery confuse the sensations so that this face what aches in the heart and makes each new start less close to the source of desire fade from the flesh that fires the night with dreams and infinite longing
our age bereft of nobility how can our faces show it i look for love my lips stand out dry and cracked with want of it oh it is well my poem shall show the need for it again we go driven by forces we have no control over only in the poem comes an image that we rule the line by the pen in the painter ’ s hand one foot away from me drawing the face and its torture that is why no one dares tackle it held as they are in the hands of forces they can not understand that despair is on my face and shall show in the fine lines of any man i had love once in the palm of my hand see the lines there how we played its game are playing now in the bounds of white and heartless fields fall down on my head love drench my flesh in the streams of fine sprays like french perfume so that i light up as mountain glorys and i am showered by the scent of the finished line no circles but that two parallels do cross and carry our souls and bodies together as the planets showing light on the surface of our skin knowing that so much of it flows through the veins underneath our cheeks puffed with it the pockets full 2. pushed on by the incompletion of what goes before me i hesitate before this paper scratching for the right words paul klee scratched for seven years on smoked glass to develop his line lavigne says look at his face he who has spent all night drawing mine the sun also rises on the rooftops beginning w/ violet i begin in blue knowing why we are cool 3. my middle name is joseph and i walk beside an ass on the way to what bethlehem where a new babe is born not the second hand of yeats but first prints on a cloudy windowpane america you boil over 4. the cauldron scalds flesh is scarred eyes shot the street aswarm with vipers and heavy armed bandits there are bandages on the wounds but blood flows unabated the bath- rooms are full oh stop up the drains we are run over 5. let me ramble here yet stay within my own yardlines i go out of bounds without defense oh attack 6. at last the game is over and the line lengthens let us stay with what we know that love is my strength that i am overpowered by it desire that too is on the face gone stale when green was the bed my love and i laid down upon such it is heart ’ s complaint you hear upon a day in june and i see no end in view when summer goes as it will upon the roads like singing companions across the land go with it man if you must but leave us markers on your way south of mission seattle over the sierra mountains the middle west and michigan moving east again easy coming into chicago and the cattle country calling to each other over canyons careful not to be caught at night they are still out the destroyers and down into the south familiar land lush places blue mountains of carolina into black mountain and you can sleep out or straight across into states i can not think of their names this nation is so large like our hands our love it lives with no lover looking only for the beloved back home into the heart new york new england vermont green mountains and massachusetts my city boston and the sea again to smell what this calm ocean can not tell us the seasons only the heart remembers and records in words of works we lay down for those men who can come to them 7. at last i come to the last defense my poems contain no wilde beestes no lady of the lake music of the spheres or organ chants yet by these lines i betray what little given me one needs no defense only the score of a man ’ s struggle to stay with what is his own what lies within him to do without which is nothing for him or those who hear him and i come to this knowing the waste leaving the rest up to love and its twisted faces my hands claw out at only to draw back from the blood already running there oh come back whatever heart you have left it is my life you save the poem is done 6.18.58

i beg to dicker with my silver-tongued companion whose lips are ready to read my shining gloss a versatile partner conversant and well-versed in the verbal art the dictionary is not averse to the solitary habits of the curiously wide-awake reader in the dark night ’ s insomnia the book is a stimulating sedative awakening my tired imagination to the hypnagogic trance of language retiring to the canopy of the bedroom turning on the bedside light taking the big dictionary to bed clutching the unabridged bulk heavy with the weight of all the meanings between these covers smoothing the thin sheets thick with accented syllables—all are exercises in the conscious regimen of dreamers who toss words on their tongues while turning illuminated pages to go through all these motions and procedures groping in the dark for an alluring word is the poet ’ s nocturnal mission aroused by myriad possibilities we try out the most perverse positions in the practice of our nightly act the penetration of the denotative body of the work any exit from the logic of language might be an entry in a symptomatic dictionary the alphabetical order of this ample block of knowledge might render a dense lexicon of lucid hallucinations beside the bed a pad lies open to record the meandering of migratory words in the rapid eye movement of the poet ’ s night vision this dictum can be decoded like the secret acrostic of a lover ’ s name

i. the question is not how like the animals we are but how we got that way we laugh for what is a suicide note but the epitaph of an emotion few of us die out in the open and when you say thesis i say antithesis but we don ’ t stop there we take our opposing ideas plant them on opposing cliffs and then build a footbridge between them seemingly flimsy yet sturdy enough in fact to support a battalion hidden behind trees we watch the soldiers march across it single file too scared to look down we cheer them all all except the boy in the fairy tale who knew no fear him we pity he laughs open-eyed ready to die as we were not he is one of us all right but better stronger stranger he asks for more fear than anyone can bear ii the guilty had three choices awkward chords of candor canned laughter or the wild hyacinth ’ s sutra before silence returned triumphant and the journey resumed in darkness though the sky above was classically blue everyone kept his opinion to himself as harmony dictated and effigies of tristan and isolde accompanied their stubborn footsteps across the wild terrain yet the longing for a loud catharsis at night renewed their pain “ if only we could climb out of these clouds and heartfelt headaches like ravished children in the glory of a snowball fight after school and never again have to descend who would not abandon these erotic shipwrecks and fall asleep like tigers in the destined heights ” iii at a festival of conceptual art in cairo i saw a tank buried entirely in snow i knew then that silence is the source of all music all laughter all thought and so i stuffed pebbles in my mouth and stood by the sea and roared my defiance of the waves it was here years before that our plane and its shadow converged i ran from the fire carrying the flames in my arms i ran and ran feeling like a man fighting a newspaper on a windy beach but it wasn ’ t a beach at all the sand beneath me was snow is snow and the spears in the desert sky look like stars in the pyramid ’ s triangular shadow i was the man who heard the crimson explosion and ran and ran iv keats in one of his letters says “ my imagination is a monastery and i am its monk. ” i wonder if a man ’ s imagination is his monastery this place looks a lot like an empty railway station king ’ s cross in london or the gare st. lazare in paris a place whose smoke and fog monet dissolved into a chorus of colors there we stood my love and i having made our vows under the suspended clock hero and bride but as we walked away side by side down the station ’ s sunless nave amid the excitement of the crowd and foreign languages spoken loud we knew our exile had already begun could hear the conductor ’ s shrill whistle could see the light at the end of the tunnel where the battlefields begin v. paradise was hardly what psyche with her bleeding blackberries and nervous orgasms could have foretold enjoyed and renounced for the sake of some querulous abstraction designed to keep us unhappy but alive call it civilization call our disobedience instinctive or say we obeyed an angry muse who ordered us to dance “ or else ” i asked she sighed before answering “ or else a dismal armchair will be your lot with chamber music your sole narcotic—music that will make you face your former self and grieve over incidents scarcely recalled and eat without pleasure and drink without thirst and dread what shall never come to pass. ” in the revelation of our nakedness we danced vi “ a ball that is caught is fuller by the weight of its return than the same ball thrown. ” our empty hands say so we feel free in the other room the true believers remain the ones who insist that evil is real the only real thing cannibals and missionaries they are accomplices in sin greedy for punishment to inflict or endure it we are glad to leave them behind glad not to have to hear their chants and wails down the elevator we go and out into the canyon created by skyscraper shadows yet even we dedicated as we are to good living sometimes walk around with a lost look on our faces as if the blessing for a piece of fruit or cup of wine had suddenly come to mind though cup and plate are empty had come to mind and faded almost instantly away vii admit it you used to walk around thinking there had to be a reason for things for everything that way paranoia lies not a science of syllables the solitude total but the prophet ’ s lit lantern was what you wanted— and what you got was “ neon in daylight ” a pleasure recommended by frank o ’ hara those pleasures meant a lot to you you even thought you lived for them until the first death a nervous uncle broke the news when you landed at kennedy and the first marriage you stayed up all night and read beyond the pleasure principle a fair description of your lovemaking it seems that new myths are needed and consumed all the time by folks like you each erases the last producing tomorrow ’ s tabula rasa after a night of dreams in which the tigers of wrath become the tigers of repose viii go back to the beginning to the first fist fight they played for high stakes those days the penalty for losing was death or slavery take your pick to spare a life was the mark of the master the mark of his slave was fear noble savage nothing forget about paradise my vote goes to hobbes ’ s “ life of man solitary poor nasty brutish and short. ” an amazing sentence the syllable that ends it also lends it its poignancy since we go on wanting what we can scarcely bear go back go back back to when god became a swan with beautiful wounded wings and raped the astonished maiden back to the dream that stays real when you wake up accustomed to your hunger and clinging to it like a panther accustomed to his cage go back ix a slap in the face and the face burns with shame anger comes later comes stranger looking for someone to blame end of message can ’ t see the stars can ’ t say anything that hasn ’ t been said before by somebody slamming the door can only repeat the syntax that brought the crowd to its feet in the silence that appeased the nightingale end of tale but its moral was simple i lost the hearing in one of my ears and listened with the other to a deaf man ’ s symphony he built a heaven out of his fears that there wasn ’ t one end of nightmare —the imperfect past going by too fast begged us to collect it it couldn ’ t last x. the doctor put his cards on the table “ take your pick ” he said he was able to offer me fear of extinction or fear of pain though freedom from neither “ you mustn ’ t complain. ” in the vertiginous air the monks wore masks to keep their germs to themselves and their identities a secret a hero to his own valet the sultan choreographed his murderous ballet until scheherazade entering the circus tent with john the baptist ’ s head on a silver tray told her tale and made the crowd repent the curtain dropped and the crowd went on its way but no one could say what the nightmare meant or why it was sent to us or by whom it was sent xi you can ’ t have it so you want it or you couldn ’ t have it so you no longer want it or you ’ re stuck with it forever it was designed with you in mind like the locked door that swung open majestically when you spoke the magic words or just answered in the affirmative when your name was called “ here i am ready to meet you ready to make any sacrifice ” you said still in bed wrestling with an evil angel in your sleep you were seventeen years old then and woke up with a limp desire is like that the girl knows what you want and cries when she gives it to you because it was yours because she whispered your name in your sleeping ear and said “ here i am. ” and was gone a minute later xii i met her in one of those sleazebag bars— i think it was called the bottom line—in buffalo self-proclaimed “ city of no illusions ” where silent men in shirtsleeves sit on bar stools and watch girls with tattoos on their buttocks strip down to g-strings and panties they dance to the thump of moronic music grind and hump under hot strobe lights and then when the act is over circulate among the scumbags gyrating in front of each in turn making each feel special and each aroused by the mingled smell of musk and sweat folds a dollar and sticks it into her crotch for a tip she was different when i left the bar that night i knew she would follow and she did and i never looked back never glanced at the rear-view mirror all other women turned into her xiii her name was mary but was miriam before that and soon she will change it to alice what she offered was a shadow the shape of europe on the map above the bed of my youth her shawl is all that remains of europe in the downstairs closet it was forbidden to lift up her skirt and look look yet boys and girls danced across the bridal morning like a bridge as the wings of the fog like white sails lingered across the bay i flew like a caterpillar with wings into a new day that was the day we buried europe we built a dome in air and in the icy silence of the tomb to hang like a spider on a subway strap seemed a suitable fate for some but we lit a candle and watched it cast the shadow of a mountain in a valley it was the awful shadow of some unseen power a heaven in a wild flower europe bloody europe was gone xiv in the dream of your choice you wake up in the garden of eden alone except for a whore with a heart wearing a nurse ’ s uniform the serpent says listen carefully this is for your own good at the tone it will be eight o ’ clock nine out of ten physicians recommend that you surround yourself with the kind of sorrows that can be instantly relieved by frivolous kisses with vegetables as lush as fruits ripening in your hands when the hospital gates are opened don ’ t hesitate run and when you arrive at last in the land of the free take your place in line with all of the others as though nothing had happened between then and now to make you doubt the conviction that you ’ re blessed xv if you were a painter you ’ d paint the wind green it would shake the boughs of the honey locust trees it would chase the leaves across the continent it would scatter their crumbs in a twist of swirling snow it would be colorless and green at the same time the wind that aligns the pond and the cloud the wind that is everywhere in constant motion as buoyant as ariel and as scornful of gross caliban the wind that holds up the fly ball drives it back into fair territory causes it to drift within reach of the right-fielder who waves off the second baseman until a last gust lifts the ball over both their heads and it lands safely for the double that ends the game in extra innings costing our team the pennant xvi after the flood refreshed was the first time you realized that the road to truth was the road of flagrant fiction you surrounded yourself with symbols a mountain a window an ark a rainbow and mythic creatures the dove that returned and the raven that didn ’ t you understood the dream of the old woman who interpreted the sailor ’ s dream then came the other birds the clouds that come when the rain is done and the wind that signals the discovery of dry land a new continent as the report of a gun sounds the start of the race as the bottle broken beneath the bridegroom ’ s foot begins the marriage as church bells start the funeral parade and all the townspeople march in the procession xvii no longer is there freedom in confusion nor forgiveness in confession nor charm in the old illusion of moonlight the tower the howling dog the escaping lovers escaping into midnight in the western hemisphere when the possibilities of expansion still seemed limitless and the soul could choose among stars without number in the vast velvet night without end —in the midst of other woe than ours i went to the window and cured the solitude of the listeners outside who shivered in the rain waiting for the police to come and ambulance sirens to sound drunk i was when i went to the bathroom looked in the mirror and said “ dad dad is that you ” in the terror of the night xviii “ wherever you follow ” he said “ i will lead. ” where summer met fall she picked up a brittle orange leaf he wanted to lie on the grass to lean and loaf at his ease but the crisis intervened news of her unpaid loan prompted him to put his sandals on his head as in the zen koan slowly he walked away silence followed then the sound of a moan in the room next door so orange it seemed a painted moon shone against the indigo sky and quickly her mood went from unreasonable euphoria to realistic dejection as the wood in the fireplace turned to ash without first yielding a flame the wool of their sweaters had begun to unravel “ if the fool persists in his folly “ someone said “ he will have food enough to eat loaves and fishes galore worship the good which is beautiful though untrue turn your back on gold. ” xix if we were painters we ’ d favor vibrant stripes primary colors flat surfaces a lot of white remaining on the canvas if we were composers we ’ d take the music of exotic jungles with us when we visit the vast vacant tundra “ if i were rich

the present—and here we ’ ve all assembled at the antiseptic airport with haunted looks on our faces occasional eye contact between man with tan and woman in white “ you look like your voice ” she says breaking the silence the rest of us know where we ’ re going but we don ’ t know when xx they ’ ve cornered the market on moral outrage yes they have the more noise they make about it the more nervous we get they ’ re always telling us just how shallow we are the only convictions we have they say are on our driver ’ s licenses the charge is not entirely fair to us though it has its grain of truth we tend to luxuriate in our indecisiveness not they no one can say they lack conviction and passion and certitude we have our doubts which make us less glamorous and give us the haunted look we wear but something in defense of our bemused spectatorship must be said at least it spares us the postures of those hypocrite lechers brothers and others who sublimate their sexuality into opulent rhetoric and chide us for not doing the same they have our best interests at heart they may even be happier than we are we have our doubts xxi today ’ s graffiti is in the sky “ more than meets the eye. ” growing up i could tell the months by their smell first come the fruitstand smells of spring in the city then the backyard trees get back their green and we know it ’ s the real thing poetry is this puzzle of missing parts is best represented by clouds in the early evening sky because they constantly change shape are utterly indifferent to us and seem both remote and near at hand at once the creation of the world is a ballet with the dancers and music missing what you see is a miniature stage-set in a museum display case and then suddenly you are walking in it along the boulevard raspail until the eiffel tower comes into view watch it organize the bridges of the seine into a coherent surprise xxii love accompanies the stranger to his streetlamp encircled by signing insects the song he hears meant doom or wax in the mariners ’ ﻿ ears and now as the smell of fresh cut grass gives way to the smell of brown leaves burning i want to tell you what i heard that night and how the day erased it i woke to the rattle of a passing car which accelerating up the rapidly rising ramp seemed delighted with its capacity for making noise from far away i could hear it coming and just as we know that fame isn ’ t all it ’ s cracked up to be that it can be downright nasty in fact and yet we want it anyway so i too knew i belonged in one of those cars tall behind the steering wheel racing to meet the changing light xxiii winter came last waves of snow from who knows which wind turned the meadow beside the frozen waterfall into an ocean the boy in the fairy tale who knew no fear soon learned on the shore of the wide world he could hear the violins of anger spelling danger poetry in this era of disbelief meant staring at a leaf until it turned into a star it was easier in the past all you had to do was sleep outside and let nature take over there were more stars in the sky than we had room for in our philosophy and when we woke berries grew beside the burbling brook and bled in our soft hands the question was not how like the gods we were but whether we could recognize them in our sleep and remember what we had seen remember them clearly when the radio alarm welcomes us into its next musical day xxiv i live in a boat in front of the door depicting the gods as they might have been forgotten by lazarus during the tortures of interrogation what i see are tombs and yellow stains on the snow instead of quotations i will refer to my heart instead of an altar i will guard the munitions and drink wine with the sour taste of cork and eat sour strawberries in the city of new york you who ’ ve been looking for a lost address and mothers who seem to be fighting back their tears what made you think you could resist the roar of the years as they echo in a cavernous subway station can you see the boat in front of the door what was it you forgot during the interrogation xxv ovid had it wrong the plight of the frightened maiden gliding noiselessly into the woods like a deer whose eyes had been mesmerized by headlights on a cold november night was implausible without the contrivance of arrows love ’ s dart claimed apollo while the dart of fear pierced daphne ’ s heart and so she ran deeper and deeper into the woods losing ground all the while to apollo for love moved faster than fear until the gods granting her wish turned the nymph into a laurel which apollo hopelessly embraced poetic justice yes except it didn ’ t happen that way their foot race ended in a forest clearing where daphne exhausted but unashamed made apollo watch her undress he entered her at her request as if his will were an extension of her own the trees inclining their branches nodded in consent love won xxvi the boy who was more eager than his father to live on a raft sleep in the woods and study the stars became his father but not before he hid in a cave slept in it overnight and was saved by a spider from sure destruction the king ’ s soldiers hot on his trail saw the web stretch unbroken in the mouth of the cave and assumed that no one was there what is the correct interpretation of the spider ’ s web to the soldiers it meant desolation to the spider conquest to the grandfather telling the tale providence the boy sees the dew cling to the web at dawn the natural camouflage of rabbits and snakes isn ’ t lost on him he notices the triangle formed by three birds in the bare-branched sycamore he can hear the hum of a bee admiring a tulip ’ s genitalia and at night he knows all the colors are present in the white of the stars xxvii that was the year i first read hölderlin the evening fell more slowly and the first day of spring arrived more suddenly and stayed lovelier longer boys pursued muses and girls impersonated them with the instinct of insects he and she on the meadow mate what they dreamed stays real when they wake up in the evening of the first day of spring did they fall out of paradise or were they pushed it ’ s unclear but we next see them enter the gathering dusk hand in hand and the camera pulls back and the voiceover says “ good fortune is even harder to bear than the bad fortune that came first remember this about the gods their own immortality suffices them the source of all rivers is a riddle even i can not solve. ” xxviii how little i have changed since then or how much of the change is in the eyes of the beholder of a book i lived rather than wrote whose author seems like a stranger to me today i remember for example wanting to write an apocalyptic parody of milton in milton ’ s high style titled “ eden in flames. ” adam and eve celebrated their carnality and when they woke the branches of the fruit trees curved gracefully down and served them nectar i couldn ’ t bring myself to describe their banishment and so the project failed yet what i heard when i slept sounded a lot like the chorus of joy in beethoven ’ s ninth and what i saw when i woke up if only for the length of a dream was a deer eyes mesmerized by headlights motionless in the middle of the road xxix you could be the only passenger on the bus who notices that the driver is blind i by contrast have eyes only for lovely you give me your hand i will kiss it you are cordially invited to my studio which resembles a psychiatrist ’ s office once there i put on my glasses read passages out loud from plato hobbes marx and freud and ask you for your opinion of each together we analyze solitude there is a meeting of the minds and sex follows it ’ s the first day of spring and we want to walk along the river and roll on the grass and take off our clothes while leaving the windows wide open in fact we can ’ t wait to get off this bus which seems to be going nowhere fast as spring puts her tongue in my ear and names the forbidden parts of her body xxx no one could say what the nightmare meant in the operating theater or the circus tent and none of this will help us pay the rent many are called and sleep through the ringing but we know it ’ s spring though we ’ ve thrown our watches away our dreams stretching across the chasm of day don ’ t deter us from waking jumping into our clothes dancing down the avenue and swinging through the revolving doors of the future where we used to live the day before yesterday when we weren ’ t dying —the question is whether the raven will return after his end-of-the-world adventures after the storm when one by one the masks slip off and the bride embraces the guilty son true to the test remembered and confessed
stumps railroad tracks early sicknesses the blue one especially your first love rounding a corner that snowy minefield whether you step lightly or heavily you have to get over to that tree line a hundred yards in the distance before evening falls letting no one see you wend your way that wonderful old-fashioned word wend meaning “ to proceed to journey to travel from one place to another ” as from bed to breakfast breakfast to imbecile work you have to get over your resentments the sun in the morning and the moon at night all those shadows of yourself you left behind on odd little tables tote that barge lift that bale you have to cross that river jump that hedge surmount that slogan crawl over this ego or that eros then hoist yourself up onto that yonder mountain another old-fashioned word yonder meaning “ that indicated place somewhere generally seen or just beyond sight. ” if you would recover you have to get over the shattered autos in the backwoods lot to that bridge in the darkness where the sentinels stand guarding the border with their half-slung rifles warned of the likes of you
people like to mock my town they mock it for being too provincial and too boring and it ’ s true not much of import happens here but i don ’ t mind some people say when they are asked what they like about palmerston north that you can always find a park and that ’ s true too you can always find a park just a short walk from where you want to go sometimes right outside you don ’ t have to walk at all you ’ re right there of course only people who live in new zealand mock palmerston north as people who live outside new zealand know nothing about it people who don ’ t live in new zealand mock our entire little country as a 1950s throwback with honest rural folk and unspoilt scenery which isn ’ t quite true our scenery is spoilt from being looked at too often and freedom campers they say are a problem but me i blame dairy cows when i lived in the uk people there thought new zealand was a state of australia and they would ask me what was coming up on neighbours thinking i had some kind of inside knowledge but the truth is i don ’ t even watch neighbours or indeed any soap operas actually the whole southern hemisphere is more or less written off by people who don ’ t live here as somewhere elsewhere insignificant like palmerston north where as i said nothing much happens and it ’ s an undeniable fact that the magazines i subscribe to come from exotic places that they flaunt in their titles magazines like the new yorker and london review of books and the paris review but not the palmerston northerner it ’ s another fact that the paris review isn ’ t even published in paris and has nothing to say about that city but it has insightful interviews with famous writers some of whom i have read i have been to paris and apart from the architecture and the food and some very fine cemeteries and of course the language it ’ s quite like palmerston north though parking is a nightmare i never visited the louvre but one fine afternoon i went to the musée d ’ orsay which in the opinion of many educated people really is just as good if you like impressionist and post-impressionist art which i do still it was nice to come home again home to palmerston north new zealand and to see the good brown manawatū river moving sluggishly under the bridge it ’ s not the seine but water is water paul celan threw himself — odd phrase as if he were both baseball and pitcher — into the seine john cleese said palmerston north is the suicide capital of new zealand yet you don ’ t hear of people throwing themselves into the manawatū which would be a risky business but only because of the effluent from those dairy cows leaching into the river we live on a floodplain and the river is ever in our thoughts and sometimes our houses at such times we are downcast but we lift up our eyes unto the hills and the windmills perched on them that turn and turn one time i saw a middle-aged woman in the plaza our only shopping mall with her head tilted to where the sky would have been but for the ceiling and the mood lighting a stout middle-aged woman with black mascara elegantly dressed her wet mouth a dark soundless o and the crowd not unsympathetically parting and reforming around her — rock in the river — noticing and not noticing which is our way
when i was “ in despair ” the dark days when i actually used such terms i noticed the behavior of animals — sleep when tired eat when hungry that made a lot of sense to me and yet i felt different i felt my humanness too much no fly ever wonders whether it should make lots and lots of maggots it gives birth on a mound of cat food or inside the rubbish bin as far as i know it ’ s not worried about overpopulation or what sort of environment its kids will grow up in my humanness sees me at an art gallery watching others watching walls my humanness gives me dark thoughts of cruel behavior you are in the states a visa glitch and there you remain like star trek i talk to you on a screen your face half a second out of sync with your speech i ’ m in the future my tuesday is already over and i want to tell you all about it to prove my superiority that lovely conceit of time that saw people travel from all over the world to be in gisborne for the first sunrise of the new millennium remember how we all thought the sewer pipes would burst and the criminals would escape or something like that y2k packs sent to every household because no one knew for certain what the numbers 2000 really meant somewhere people important people cowered in bunkers fearing the worst
tonight i am in search of clues on how to be a man not a man like my father who traded his motorcycle for a job in the plane yards after my mother left before my father tried telling me wrestling was fake we watched men scrap with brass knuckles and bull ropes back then a dude could get his jaw broke calling the wrong guy a fake lou thesz was a bona fide grappler stretching men with that toehold facelock snapping men ’ s elbows to protect his championship belt my grandfather saw him lose the title to bronko nagurski celebrated footballer who stomped men into the turf on his way to the end zone before my father died he insisted my grandfather never saw that match that men always invent things when they have something genuine to say today everyone knows that fight was fixed tonight i am thinking about all those shapes lou thesz could twist out of a man ’ s skeleton and how some nights that just isn ’ t enough
the bend in the river followed us for days and above us the sun doubled and redoubled its claims now we are in a house with forty-four walls and nothing but doors outside the trees chokecherries mulberries and oaks are cracking like limbs we can do nothing but listen or so someone claims the ice man perhaps all enclosed in ice though the light has been shortening our days and coloring nights the yellow of hay scarlet of trillium blue of block ice words appear the texture of ice with messages etched on their shells minna 1892 big max and little sarah this hour ago everyone watched as the statues fell enough of such phrases and we ’ ll have a book enough of such books and we ’ ll have mountains of ice enough to balance our days with nights enough at last to close our eyes
fishing if i a fisher may protest of pleasures is the sweetest of sports the best of exercises the most excellent of recreations the most innocent but now the sport is marred and what ye why fishes decrease and fishers multiply
the style a form of concealment the way style is his manners seemed a parody almost of manners a movie star of bygone days strangely elaborate highly stylized manners complicit with his fame and with your praise looking toward you and then away from you star-like movie-star-like a dance routine the walk almost a glide or elegant shuffle always on the verge of veering away circling away and over to the other side of the frozen skating arena that he was on a dancer ’ s courtesy the courtesy i mean of the dancer to the audience flirtatious and familiar only for you and entirely impersonal and withheld all of the above though maybe misses the point because it seems to say he knew about what he was doing or what the style was for and nothing let one be sure that this was so a look on his face of amusement as if he knew a secret that he shared with you and yet kept to himself as if it only showed the cryptogram but wouldn ’ t provide the key to read it with but could he read the code one night late at night as we were driving home from having had dinner out in boston we saw him figure skating through charles street circle right through and among the circling lights of cars as if with champion skill on thin ice whirling oblivious to the astonished blaring horns as a dancer or skater seems while dancing to the music that we hear oblivious to the music that we hear and listening to some other music heard from somewhere else so peter moved like a dancer or skater through and among the dangerous outraged cars as if untouchable and untouched and moving to the sounds of something else from somewhere else— the music maybe of his madness was it it was as if he skated in solitude and glided whirling on a lonely tarn far out away from everything there is
a man and a woman are sitting at a table it is supper time the air is green the walls are white in the green air as rocks under water retain their own true color though washed in green i do not know either the man or the woman nor do i know whatever they know of each other though washed in my eye they keep their own true color the man is all his own hunched strength the body ’ s self and strength that bears like weariness itself upon itself as a stone ’ s weight bears heavily on itself to be itself heavy the strength that bears the body down and the way he feeds is like a dreamless sleep the dreaming of a stone is how he feeds the woman ’ s arms are plump mottled a little the flesh like standing milk and on one arm a blue bruise got in some household labor or other flowering in the white her staring eye like some bird ’ s cry called from some deepest wood says nothing of what it is but what it is such silence is the bird ’ s cry of the stone
“ it must be awful ” she said to the dog locked in it as she left the kitchen that wasn ’ t hers closing its door to head up the stairs with every good thing she could find to eat in her arms to eat in her arms—o katherine “ not to have any arms ”
a queer thing about those waters there are no birds there or hardly any i did not miss them i do not remember missing them or thinking it uncanny the beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone a quarry outraged by hulls we took pleasure in that the emptiness the hardness of the light the silence and the water ’ s stillness but this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes this hurt and goes on hurting the venomous soft jelly the undersides we could stand the world if it were hard all over
as at the far edge of circling the country facing suddenly the other ocean the boundless edge of what i had wanted to know i stepped into my answers ’ shadow ocean the tightening curl of the corners of outdated old paperbacks breakers a crumble surf of tiny dry triangles around my ankles sinking in my stand taken that the horizon written by the spin of my compass is that this is is not enough a point to turn around on is like a skin that falls short of edge as a rug that covers a no longer natural spot no longer existent to live on from the map of my person come to the end of but not done that country crossed was what i could imagine and that little spit of answer is the shadow— not the ocean which casts it— that i step next into to be cleansed of question but not of seeking …it as if simplified for the seeking come to its end at this body
chemicals ripen the citrus there are rattlesnakes in the mountains and on the shoreline hygiene inhuman caution beef in cellophane tall as giraffes the orange-rancher ’ s daughters crop their own groves mistrustful perpetual summer seems precarious on the littoral we drive inland to prove the risk we sense at once winter claps-to like a shutter high over the ojai valley and discloses a double crisis winter and drought ranges on mountain-ranges empty unwatered crumbling hot colours come at the eye it is too cold for picnics at the trestle-tables claypit yellow burns on the distance the phantom walks everywhere of intolerable heat at ventucopa elevation two-eight-nine-six the water hydrant frozen deserted or broken settlements gasoline stations closed and boarded by nightfall to the snows and over the mile on tilted mile of the mountain park the bright cars hazarded
northward i came and knocked in the coated wall at the door of a low inn scaled like a urinal with greenish tiles the door gave and i came home to the stone north every wynd and snicket known to me wherever the flattened cat squirmed home to a hole between housewall and paving known and in the turns of it no welcome no flattery of the beckoned lighted eye from a rose of the rose-brick alleys of toulouse those more than tinsel garlands more than masks unfading wreaths of ancient summers i sternly cast off a stern eye is the graceless bulk and bruise that at the steep uphill confronts me with its drained-of-colour sandstone implacably the church it is good friday goodbye to the middle ages although some think that i enter them those centuries of monkish superstition here i leave them with their true garlands and their honest masks every fresh flower cast on the porch and trodden raked by the wind at the church door on this friday goodbye to all the centuries there is no home in them much as the dip and turn of an honest alley charmingly deceive us and not yet quite goodbye instead almost welcome i said bleak equal centuries crowded the porch to be deflowered crowned
i have to leave early in the dark and hungry to avoid crossing the snow as the noon burns the crust into an un-servable lake slush instead of the crisp bridge that would be in order to get me over the ridge my journal is already laundered clean of my words and my instructions have dissolved into a white mash a washed bone ball rolled into itself of all i have in the world in my pocket the ink is thin the paper is poor my eyes balance on the pale words around which a stream flows almost erasing the way across the idea shadows the black flowers of the light self -sowing through the trees dark gardens of midnight for the gray-white morning hour of blindness in print miles before i am to arrive here to approach the waiting milestone dims whatever else of its lantern ‘ til only the placed light there is on me in this light barely but used to it i can make out the staggered columns of my account as if back through weren ’ t the real distance the thin chest flag pinned on by each ridge the titled introduction taking your coat each storm my letters and ribbons have been the natural— strengths on their way to the more— natural weaknesses— and loss yet— i wonder where i thought i was going— to ’ ve done what you must pass examinations for before i took any
“ stooped to truth and moralized his song ” spring pricks a little i get out the maps time to demoralize my song high time vernal a little primavera first green first truth and last high time high time a high old time we had of it last summer i overstate but getting out the maps… look up the valley of the brenne louise de la vallière… syntax collapses high time for that high time to château-renault the tannery town whose marquis rooke and james butler whipped in vigo bay or so the song says an amoral song like ronsard ’ s where we go today perhaps perhaps tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow and… get well philip ’ s black-sailed familiar avaunt or some word as ridiculous the whole diction kit begins to fall apart high time it did high time high time and a long time yet my love get out that blessed map ageing you take your glasses off to read it stooping to truth we potter to montoire high time my love high time and a long time yet
i called a man today after he said hello and i said hello came a pause during which it would have been confusing to say hello again so i said how are you doing and guess what he said fine and wondered aloud how i was and it turns out i ’ m ok. he was on the couch watching cars painted with ads for budweiser follow cars painted with ads for tide around an oval that ’ s a metaphor for life because most of us run out of gas and settle for getting drunk in the stands and shouting at someone in a t-shirt we want kraut on our dog i said he could have his job back and during the pause that followed his whiskers scrubbed the mouthpiece clean and his breath passed in and out in the tidal fashion popular with mammals until he broke through with the words how soon thank you ohmygod which crossed his lips and drove through the wires on the backs of ions as one long word as one hard prayer of relief meant to be heard by the sky when he began to cry i tried with the shape of my silence to say i understood but each confession of fear and poverty was more awkward than what you learn in the shower after he hung up i went outside and sat with one hand in the bower of the other and thought if i turn my head to the left it changes the song of the oriole and if i give a job to one stomach other forks are naked and if tonight a steak sizzles in his kitchen do the seven other people staring at their phones hear
wiretaps and tapes concealed bugs and mikes intercepted letters full of passionate declarations contradictory intelligence— how attached he ’ d grown to the subject ’ s documents revising and rearranging the influx of intelligence with a sentiment he acknowledged almost like love he felt the cool gray eyes of his superiors trained on him rebuking him for swerving for letting himself go—such tender obsession occasioned by the file not quite the professional style he or the agency expected… but such official loyalties seemed mere protocol to this — what was wrong with him he wondered that he construed the documents to make the subject seem a hero a bastard whose sole patrimony was a pair of shoes and a rusted sword left by an unknown father beneath a stone and yet his exploits in the tabloids the headlines screaming scourge of monsters strikes again hero founds republic were these heroic different in kind from the rumors unverified of a rape a murder —but to have met undisguised the devouring monster to have escaped the twisting tunnels of the maze… on balance for such a life the hero ’ s reputation wasn ’ t bad think of the opportunities for evil a man of such qualities must have had how well he knew him—an essential innocence that followed impulse blind to protocol not noticeably more kind than he was cruel but to stamp case closed and cease gathering intelligence to give the hero up almost he admitted like a lover… such limits the hero unknowingly transgressed and the agency cold-blooded where limits were concerned “ mere protocol ” — more like a second backbone committed to keeping order could not afford such sentiments—the chief of security felt an awful pang that the work of intelligence should lead to this… he leaned back in his chair and sighed a forged genealogy certifying that the hero ’ s father was a king a mutual assistance pact to aid in taking back the usurped crown he could see them now the wind blowing lightly the two of them sweating as they climbed the cliff discussing the terms exchanging information intelligence— how would his own face look staring down across the sea as he gestured earnestly toward some island saying “ according to our sources the tax revenues… ” and then edging the hero closer to the cliff pointing out the harbor he ’ d push
for jane —all huge like giant flightless kiwis twice the size of ostriches they turned and walked away from us and you were there jane and you were twenty-two but this was the nineteen-forties in wichita near the edge of town in a field surrounded by a copse of cottonwoods it was getting dark and the trees around the bridge almost glowed like a scene by palmer the two giant birds—aepyorni—from madagascar extincted a.d. one thousand turned and walked from us across the bridge even in the semi-darkness the softness of their brown feathers made curls pliant as a young mother ’ s hair there was a sweet submission in the power of their enormous legs giant drumsticks their tiny heads in proportion to their bodies were bent utterly submerged in their business and sweeping side to side as a salmon does—or as a wolf does— but with a pleistocene self-involved gentleness beyond our ken my heart rose in my chest as the metaphysical poets say “ with purple wings of joy. ” to see them back in life again we both looked holding hands and i felt your wide-eyed drinking-in of things then i turned and viewed across the darkening field and there was a huge flightless hunting fowl the kind that ate mammals in the pliocene he stood on one leg in the setting sun by the sparkling stream that cut across the meadow to the bridge he had a hammer head and curled beak and after my initial surge of fear to see the field was dotted populated by his brethren each standing in the setting sun i saw their stately nobility and again the self-involvement we followed the aepyorni across the old wooden bridge made of huge timbers the bridge was dark from the shadows of the poplars and the evergreens there the stream was dimpled with flashing moonlight —and i think it had a little song then i found that on the bridge we were among a herd of black wildebeests—black gnus one was two feet away—turned toward me— looking me eye-into-eye there was primal wildness in the upstanding coarse not sleek as it really is in africa fur on the knobby powerful-like-buffalo shoulders remember this is a dream i passed by him both afraid and unafraid of wildness as i had passed through the herd of zebras at the top of ngorongoro crater in front of the lodge where from the cliff we could see a herd of elephants like ants and the soda lake looked pink because of flamingos there there is an essence in fear overcome and i overcame fright in passing those zebras and this black wildebeest then we passed over the heavy bridge and down a little trail on the far side of the meadow walking back in the direction we had been soon we came to a cottage of white clapboards behind a big white clapboard house and knocked on the door it was answered by a young man with long hair who was from the incredible string band he took us inside and he played an instrument like a guitar and he danced as he played it the lyre-guitar was covered with square plastic buttons in rows of given sizes and shapes the instrument would make any sound play any blues make any creature sound play any melody…i wanted it badly—it was a joy my chest rose i figured i ’ d have to and would be glad to give twenty or thirty thousand for it… then the dream broke and i was standing somewhere with joanna to the side of a crowd of people by a wall of masonry and i reached into my mouth and took from my jaw all the other persons vanished and i was the center of everything a piece which was eight teeth fused together i stared at them wondering how they could all be one piece they were white…it was some new fossil down on the bone there were indentations like rivulets like the flowing patterns of little rivers
we went into a market—they call it a grocery—and you can ’ t imagine fruit brilliant as magazine photos all kinds of different oranges grapefruits mandarins some tiny clementines with a blue sticker—morocco—they ’ ve come so far ... the eggs are painted with colors corresponding to the days of the week you ’ re supposed to eat them a different color for each opportunity i felt dizzy the gulf between myself and this place seemed insuperable tears welled up in my eyes i wanted desperately to flee to get outside so i could breathe i wanted to explain to phillis the north american who had invited me what was happening to me i tried but she couldn ’ t understand you have to have felt it yourself the first time for the first time my mind had crossed over five hundred years of development at jet speed and arrived in the future a cold future its display cases filled with artificial snow and artificial heat there were a thousand things i never knew existed a panoply of brand names and gadgets for every purpose i felt like someone from the stone age and realized most people on the planet never know the era they ’ re living in any more than they could know the quantity of living matter in this galaxy that surrounds us or the milky complexity of the molecules in their own brains and what ’ s more they don ’ t know that they ’ ll die without ever knowing i felt terror of that gloss of the waxed fruit of propaganda so refined it could dilute the existence of the strange things before my eyes other sensations everything wanting to be used up immediately licked tasted eaten packaged mastered i knew i couldn ’ t stand this avalanche this brilliant swarm for long these rows on rows of distant faces staring out at me from cardboard boxes i ’ d seen nothing singular in the place no unique thing i could separate out from the amorphous mass of texture and sensation i began to move closer imagining i walked with those who have never eaten meat or tasted cow ’ s milk who have never nursed except from the teat of a goat those who have had only wildflowers to chew when the winter hunger comes i approached closer still imagining i walked with the salty ones who collect their water from the public pipe my nose began to bleed and phillis said it was the cold i knew that wasn ’ t the problem we were near the seafood display i moved closer fish have always aroused in me both horror and desire i moved closer like a lost child feeling her way through space toward something of hers that ’ s hidden i brushed the shells with my fingertips they were smooth and delicate but obviously artificial made to be used once and thrown away at first touch they might seem real pearly perfect but they ’ re actually plastic and they ’ ve never even seen any sea

september is a month like any other and unlike any other it seems in september everything awaited will arrive in the calm air in a particular scent in the stillness of the quay when september comes i know i ’ m going to lose myself the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so the air comes and goes beneath my dress pressing the warm cloth against me pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications the salty sticky wall of the malecón is covered with fish and forgotten hooks i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky in that moment the rest of the city can vanish it ’ s just that sea and me before all thought all desire then i undress and enter knowing i ’ ll find something and that the boats—which seem suspended on the horizon seem to have slipped their limits motionless and painted there—are also mine ... when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after—though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks shaping a sort of formless impression something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you but without making a human form and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle ’ s spoked wheel ... the bicycle moves on and i ’ m carried along filled with dry branches and coral in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together the little house one point amid the infinite comes into view already we can see the windows like little black voids and their curtains beating in the wind i squeeze your waist the bicycle moves on even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on rolls on against the spray when you turn your head and see my hand my hook snagged in a struggle of desire the sun has turned immense in your eyes again you make for the little house already in view already at the edge of the curve ... a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig his body—your body—is an arc i want to tighten to overcome to conquer hidden behind a tree i can see your eyes again the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries the arc tightens and closes i throw an arm over you a leg a hand a lip hallucinations an ear—as usual my body moves on the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries its water burns in my thighs in the course of my dreams the mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the united states it is born in lake itasca passes through st. paul st. louis memphis new orleans traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the gulf of mexico i ’ m in geography class i like this class the world just barely fits in my head the map hangs before me with its spokes and points someone made that all up just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there all those castles and fortifications to toy with the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality but isn ’ t because we ’ re not outside but inside the globe that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency and even far from the classroom nothing ’ s different there ’ s just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world always turning imperfect and constant inside me i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can ’ t measure i also like the geography professor whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself he doesn ’ t know he can ’ t imagine that while he lectures while he looks at me i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river the boy behind me won ’ t stop looking at me and whatever one does the others all follow watching from the corners of their eyes that ’ s why i ’ m going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won ’ t find me alone at my desk in the middle of the world ... in the middle of the lake there ’ s a boat and we ’ re three—although the third may have already vanished for us—and i want to paddle and sit in the center you ’ ve taken off your shirt the landscape appears and disappears when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge you try to teach me you take my hands—you ’ re behind and above me my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat i ’ m wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders we try to steer but go nowhere you explain the roundness of the earth the sharpened tip of the compass needle always precise marking contours lines limits the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances the symmetry forgetfulness incarnation in other beings animals plants and later men once again you taught me all this but i ’ m not a map and i hold still i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end the oar descends toward the deep it is september we don ’ t move i keep still to be different that ’ s why ...
no need to drive a nail into the wall to hang your hat on when you come in just drop it on the chair no guest has sat on don ’ t worry about watering the flowers— in fact don ’ t plant them you will have gone back home before they bloom and who will want them if mastering the language is too hard only be patient the telegram imploring your return won ’ t need translation remember when the ceiling sheds itself in flakes of plaster the wall that keeps you out is crumbling too as fast or faster translated from the german by adam kirsch
we were dancing—it must have been a foxtrot or a waltz something romantic but requiring restraint rise and fall precise execution as we moved into the next song without stopping two chests heaving above a seven-league stride—such perfect agony one learns to smile through ecstatic mimicry being the sine qua non of american smooth and because i was distracted by the effort of keeping my frame the leftward lean head turned just enough to gaze out past your ear and always smiling smiling i didn ’ t notice how still you ’ d become until we had done it for two measures four —achieved flight that swift and serene magnificence before the earth remembered who we were and brought us down
i know if i find you i will have to leave the earth and go on out over the sea marshes and the brant in bays and over the hills of tall hickory and over the crater lakes and canyons and on up through the spheres of diminishing air past the blackset noctilucent clouds where one wants to stop and look way past all the light diffusions and bombardments up farther than the loss of sight into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark and i know if i find you i will have to stay with the earth inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest coelenterates and praying for a nerve cell with all the soul of my chemical reactions and going right on down where the eye sees only traces you are everywhere partial and entire you are on the inside of everything and on the outside i walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut and i see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down and if i find you i must go out deep into your far resolutions and if i find you i must stay here with the separate leaves

`` the eagle has landed '' —apollo ii commander neil a. armstrong '' a magnificent desolation '' — air force colonel edwin e. `` buzz '' aldrin jr. july 20 1969 that afternoon in mid-july two pilgrims watched from distant space the moon ballooning in the sky they rose to meet it face-to-face their spidery spaceship eagle dropped down gently on the lunar sand and when the module 's engines stopped rapt silence fell across the land the first man down the ladder neil spoke words that we remember now— “ one small step ... ” it made us feel as if we were there too somehow when neil planted the flag and buzz collected lunar rocks and dust they hopped like kangaroos because of gravity or wanderlust a quarter million miles away one small blue planet watched in awe and no one who was there that day will soon forget the sight they saw
the tint of the sky between sunset and night and wandering with you and your nephew in that maze half-lost—madrid of the austrias—looking for plaza of the green cross where days before you arrived an opel with false plates was parked its wheels straddling the curb and so the van heading for the barracks that morning had to slow to squeeze past back at the hotel your mom is holding up her gift—amethyst she says admiring how light when passing through a prism bends at his window that morning before we began my student said ¡qué bonito watching it drift and descend settling on roofs and cars and i think of you and your wife and daughter getting to see madrid in white your visit winding down and how i had wanted that lesson to end to get to the park—retiro they say is the city ’ s one lung and the way the feel and sound of steps cease when grass is completely covered as if walking on a cloud the year before on a visit from the coast a friend sitting at a window watched the flakes flutter and fall dissolving before reaching the ground—aguanieve he said while from a town near seville b-52s were lifting off i was in a trance that week though like most things the war in the gulf was soon another backdrop like the string of car bombs the following year and yet that morning as soon as i heard something led me not to the park but down to city hall workers in the street evacuated sipping coffee though i never reached the site—of course it was cordoned off the spray of glass the heap of twisted metal and so later learned their names their lives of the five there was one a postal clerk who as a boy would plunge his hands into the white the cold a sweet jolt whenever he got to touch the stuff scooping it tightly into a ball like the ones he would dodge and throw years later at his wife-to-be those weekends those places—away from city air— a release miraflores siete picos rascafría it ’ s in his blood she would come to say chatting with a neighbor about his thing for snow—the way it falls softly blanketing roofs and groves villages nestled in the sierra ’ s hills it is february and she is picturing him and the boy up there now playing horsing around
alone in the library room even when others are there in the room alone except for themselves there is the illusion of peace the air in the room is stilled there are reading lights on the tables looking as if they 're reading looking as if they 're studying the text and understanding shedding light on what the words are saying but under their steady imbecile gaze the page is blank patiently waiting not to be blank the page is blank until the mind that reads crosses the black river seeking the queen of the underworld persephone where she sits by the side of the one who brought her there from enna hades the mute the deaf king of the dead letter she is clothed in the beautiful garment of our thousand misunderstandings of the sacred text
— one hundred breaths split the air as i lean on the only pine tree i find it ’ s early or late it ’ s breezy or hot the fields are dry summer is near the horses are everywhere strangely galloping a dream but i can ’ t remember how to call them so i stand back watch them pass — the first time i rode a horse my body found the music of fire crackling the wind an unbearable pleasure that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg a sign the horsekeeper told me of longing a need to return—to belong after all departure is like pushing the weight of our heart against the village whose name has kept us awake — rafael came from somewhere in eurasia i passed my hands through his mane— saw a history of conquests and battles a field of hay a mount of truth heard a silent ring his eyes asking me to go with him to confess something sacred to name something lustful nothing of where he came from or who i was disturbed us — i knew he was different by the way he ran— without pause without grace without distraction without ease he was told how to move in the world and resented it he knew he would never own anything — he came toward me it was a quiet afternoon i stood unmoving and we listened to the untitled music circling the earth like an anthem free of its nation — he was unfamiliar to me approaching as if he possessed the land every morning he stopped five feet from the river

after the declaration by emperor to stop the war many people in tokyo killed themselves for instance in front of the imperial palace but few people knows those facts hence you must teach me where you got the news or what sort of book gave you the fact that quite few people knows to know the fact of our nation ’ s subjection is not so comfortable but the fact of many people ’ s spontaneous death gives me more complicated feelings in the matter of what william gass said i must describe my feelings i went to nagasaki on an educational trip four years ago i can recollect those serious moment which was given by the beamed materials in the memorial hall but most youth after the war are indifferent to those nightmares because of our no experience surely i think those barbarious conducts shouldn ’ t be forgiven or forgotten at all and we must not close our eyes to the rebombing at any place in this world in conclusion i may say that most people except sufferers or the like will not have ill feelings toward your country but they will reproach the suffocative fact in history where were you when the world war ii was over please share your experience of the war with me i ’ m now interested in the wars concerned with japan for the past 100 years if you tell me your reflections i can suspect more seriously you have abandoned such cursed things as useless in that war 3 million people were killed on the side of our nation especially three hundred thousand people by the a-bomb over the war between the imperialism and militarism america won a victory what does this word mean
flour on the floor makes my sandals slip and i tumble into your arms too hot to bake this morning but blueberries begged me to fold them into moist muffins sticks of rhubarb plotted a whole pie the windows are blown open and a thickfruit tang sneaks through the wire screen and into the home of the scowly lady who lives next door yesterday a man in the city was rescued from his apartment which was filled with a thousand rats something about being angry because his pet python refused to eat he let the bloom of fur rise rise over the little gnarly blue rug over the coffee table the kitchen countertops and pip through each cabinet snip at the stumpy bags of sugar the cylinders of salt our kitchen is a riot of pots wooden spoons melted butter so be it maybe all this baking will quiet the angry voices next door if only for a brief whiff i want our summers to always be like this—a kitchen wrecked with love a table overflowing with baked goods warming the already warm air after all the pots are stacked the goodies cooled and all the counters wiped clean—let us never be rescued from this mess
miracle fruit changes the tongue one bite and for hours all you eat is sweet placed alone on a saucer it quivers like it 's cold from the ceramic even in this florida heat small as a coffee bean red as jam— i ca n't believe the man who sold it to my father on interstate 542 had one tooth one sandal and called me '' duttah duttah '' i wanted to ask what is that but the red buds teased me into our car and away from his fruit stand one bite and if you eat it whole it softens and swells your teeth like a mouthful of mallow so how long before you lose a sandal and still walk how long before you lose the sweetness

the canyon walls close in again slant light a silver glare in brown water the water is only knee deep but when the boy reaches the boulders— purple dark silvered by the smash of brute water— water will tear at his chest and arms the walls of the canyon are brilliant in late light they would have glared red and gold for his drowned camera splashed blood to his left to his right a wall of sun laddered with boulders more than boulders some stranger once fought down this cliffside his rope of twisted dry vines strung boulder to boulder clifftop to arroyo escape escape maybe maybe bones in the desert i think of hands scuffed raw from the braiding almost… water froths over the boulders tugs at the boy ’ s footing almost… the blood cliff to his left blinds him blind nails scrape at two boulders a torn vine whipping somewhere above him he wedges knees against polished rock pressing up clawing slick stone now rope cutting his hand he skids underwater silver and froth a film of bright blood staining his eyes but he drags hand over hand up out of the water climbing the sun hand over hand the ancient vines holding boulders for foothold up out of that canyon

for john barrell 1. gone to lunch back in five minutes night closed in on my letter of resignation out in the square one of my threads had broken loose the language i used was no and no while the yellow still came through the hammer and the drills occasionally the metabolism alters and lines no longer come express waiting for you what muscles work me which hold me down below my head it is a long coat and a van on the horizon a bird that vanishes the arabic i learn from observation is how to break the line genius creates surprises the metropolitan police band singing ‘ bless this house ’ as the filmed extractor fans inflate the house with steam 2. walking my back home the wind is the wind is a no-vo-cain band and the footstep echoes i have conjured people 3. ah it all falls into place when it was time what he had left became a tile bodies held shaped by the pressure of air were clipped to his attention by their gestures my but we do have powerful muscles each of us equal to gravity or sunlight that forces our shadows into the pieces of a fully interlocking puzzle 4. good morning he whispered the horrors of the horses are the crows the bird flies past the outside the library many heels have trapped the same way he tolls he lapsed with the light from so many trees check the pattern swerves with the back the tree that holds the metal spiral staircase swings aloft the hand removes a book and checked it for death by glasses or the angle food descends 5. the broadcast she turns me on she turns on me that the view from the window is a lake and silent cars are given the noise of flies dying in the heat of the library the grass outside goes brown in my head behind my glasses behind the glass in the precinct thus too they whisper in museums and banks
the way out the night is covered with signs the body and face of man with signs and his journeys where the rock is split and speaks to the water the flame speaks to the cloud the red splatter abstraction on the door speaks to the angel and the constellations the grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon and the loud hammering of the land behind speaks ringing up the bones of our thighs the hoofs we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea all night down the centuries have heard music of passage music of one child carried into the desert firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid drawn through the water with the water-drawn people led by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain the voice of the world speaking the world covered by signs the burning the loving the speaking the opening strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain still flame the spoken singing of a young child the meaning beginning to move which is the song music of those who have walked out of slavery into that journey where all things speak to all things refusing to accept the curse and taking for signs the signs of all things the world the body which is part of the soul and speaks to the world all creation being created in one image creation this is not the past walking into the future the walk is painful into the present the dance not visible as dance until much later these dancers are discoverers of god we knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song out of a life of building lack on lack the slaves refusing slavery escaping into faith an army who came to the ocean the walkers who walked through the opposites from i to opened thou city and cleave of the sea those at flaming nauvoo the ice on the great river the escaping negroes swamp and wild city the shivering children of paris and the glass black hearses those on the long march all those who together are the frontier forehead of man where the wilderness enters the world the song of the world akiba rescued secretly in the clothes of death by his disciples carried from jerusalem in blackness journeying to find his journey to whatever he was loving with his life the wilderness journey through which we move under the whirlwind truth into the new the only accurate a cluster of lights at night faces before the pillar of fire a child watching while the sea breaks open this night the way in barbarian music a new song acknowledging opened water possibility open like a woman to this meaning in a time of building statues of the stars valuing certain partial ferocious skills while past us the chill and immense wilderness spreads its one-color wings until we know rock water flame cloud or the floor of the sea the world is a sign a way of speaking to find what shall we find energies rhythms journey ways to discover the song of the way in

long before the fresh apple crisis my life had some form to it i would wake in the mornings—i would perform something for example the day i tried as one with acute passion might to win one woman over but accidentally won another—that whole time i had been living like someone though i can ’ t remember his name his model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that i inhabit in time of need this time the need was surprising people tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk and apples take their shape naturally the guy whose name escapes me now taught me to look upon others ’ concerns as mine to make at home i was fond of doing many things at home but my favorite was drinking juice when my friends came by—they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands thinking they knew what i needed and planning to force it on me—i had to tell them i was busy with my juice two weeks before the crisis i had been writing some poems about it it was a warm day not entirely different from other warm days in san francisco people were on the street pale people were on the street making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned the poems i had written were failures but dense ones it seemed appropriate to think the person ’ s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people i had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can ’ t help but enjoy that day i had in a sense gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them i awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something—not anything life threatening but definitely personal my lover then wanted to spend much of her life asleep she had no ostensible reaction to the city ’ s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them in a world where a person ’ s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets i could not find four people who cared i thought that if i could find those four people we could really do something a few of my friends pretended they were chosen a few neighbors felt bad and made offers my mother called to console me my lover—in actuality the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop slept next to me sleep became our network falling in and out of it for change the rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time so i kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness if by morning i could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing she would reward me before the crisis the reward would have needed only to be an apple one but after the apples were gone the landscape usually contains the solution to what ’ s lost demographics help people in cars some people did not notice me some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me that was two days before the evening before it was two days before the crisis i was thinking that i did not think i was asleep i had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate ’ s cat in it when i looked again there was no light—but i had not been asleep it ’ s the way people react to traumatic events they say “ i had just been there ” or will say “ she was just with me. ” so the loss of light was emotional and the lost state—demographic i began to trace things by their disappearance alone in the room my memory and anticipated darkness going for light people like to talk about the daytime people in strange moods often miss the daytime before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods i had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste i was happy i mean i was in my juice five weeks before the crisis i was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house i did not really work there but i went there every week all but the third sunday of each month i would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale not to buy but to stand next to shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs that was one thing i would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn ’ t see i had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed my parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere my father would always say “ if you ’ re not going to be a people person then numbers will have to do. ” he was surprised that with all the time i had on my hands i chose to spend most of it alone numbers then did hold some mystery for me but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore for years i had known that if there was a wall between where i was and where i needed to be i did not want it there some people have personal goals that are demanding certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed my decision to drink only fresh juice which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast kept me busy rounding up cash i would have to leave most friendships behind as a way of keeping my life “ wall-free ” i had to divide my time i would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories the second part of my day i would spend telling people about the first part the other parts are not of substance here twenty-five years before the crisis i had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany i am always drinking in my poems a good friend says in the first years of my life everything i ate was mush today i will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this when i had that remarkable glass of apple juice i had no idea that one day i simply would not be able to find it the city gets rid of its apples people find themselves inventing fruit the day i decided to write poems about it—it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage—i had been resting in my best friend ’ s easy chair we were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me five days later i had twenty poems when a person writes a poem about her passions people on the street are bound to notice them the passions overwhelm the body she carries the body as though it were the book the friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week and though i miss her it was the failures that saved me on every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful if certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall the person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly in the alley behind the natural foods grocery i met my second lover for the first time meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present and the weather was so hot during the crisis only the alleys had shade forty-eight days into the crisis while on a thirst strike i had to make a run for the alley not as though people were after me but the elements the foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need at the bottom of any body-based need is grace when i appeared at the opening of the alley a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things—i thought about telling her or—short women make me want things all the time while i was growing up i put a lot of demands on my juice forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it i did not forget it but was embroiled the newspapers were saying things about the past people were celebrating thick juice and i kept writing those poems that day in the alley i realized three things about life while assisting her i learned three things to carry around with me to disperse when needed for six months during the crisis i did not care about the crisis when my faith returned all my lovers were gone that morning i woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis i was beneath my bed it was the sixth day that i had awakened beneath my bed i was lonely but i was also sure life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character who—when we passed on the street—did not know me i knew it was me by the way my head felt people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it today all my ideas are liquid that day of my faith friends thinking i was sick came by to see me it would be the last day i spent alone i was happy but still would not drink the juice on my mind was no longer juice there was an absence there but one so constant it became familiar i did not want to drink it

my father had a steel comb with which he would comb our hair after a bath the cold metal soothing against my scalp his hand cupping my chin my mother had a red pullover with a little yellow duck embroidered on it and a pendant made from a gold victoria coronation coin which later when we first moved to buffalo would be stolen from the house the sunn ’ i muslims have a story in which the angels cast a dark mark out of prophet mohammad ’ s heart thus making him pure though the shi ’ a reject this story believing in his absolute innocence from birth telling the famous story of the blanket in which the prophet covers himself with a yemeni blanket for his afternoon rest joined under the blanket first by his son-in-law ali then each of his grandchildren hassan and hussain and finally by his daughter bibi fatima in heaven gabriel asks god about the five under the blanket and god says those are the five people whom i loved the most out of all creation and i made everything in the heavens and the earth for their sake gabriel speaker on god ’ s behalf whisperer to prophets asks god can i go down and be the sixth among them and god says go down there and ask them if they consent you may go under the blanket and be the sixth among them creation for the sake of gabriel is retroactively granted when the group under the blanket admits him to their company is that me at the edge of the blanket asking to be allowed inside asking the 800 hadith be canceled all history re-ordered in hyderabad i prayed every part of the day climbed a thousand steps to the site of maula ali ’ s pilgrimage i wanted to be those stairs the hunger i felt the river inside i learned to pronounce my daily prayers from transliterated english in a book called “ know your islam ” dark blue with gold calligraphed writing that made the english appear as if it were arabic complete with marks above and below the letters i didn ’ t learn the arabic script until years later and never learned the language itself god ’ s true language hebrew latin arabic sanskrit as if utterance fit into the requirements of the human mouth i learned how to find the new moon by looking for the circular absence of stars when abraham took isaac up into the thicket his son did not know where he was being led when his father bound him and took up the knife he was shocked and said “ father where is the ram ” though from abraham ’ s perspective he was asked by god to sacrifice his son and proved his love by taking up the knife thinking to himself perhaps oh ismail ismail do i cut or do i burn i learned god ’ s true language is only silence and breath fourth son of a fourth son my father was afflicted as a child and as was the custom in those days a new name was selected for him to protect his health still the feeling of his rough hand gently cupping my cheek dipping the steel comb in water to comb my hair flat my hair was kept so short combed flat when wet i never knew my hair was wavy until i was nearly twenty-two and never went outside with wet and uncombed hair until i was twenty-eight at which point i realized my hair was curly my father ’ s hands have fortune-lines in them cut deeply and dramatic the day i left his house for the last time i asked him if i could hold his hand before i left there are two different ways of going about this if you have known this for years why didn ’ t you ask for help he asked me each time i left home including the last time my mother would hold a quran up for me to walk under once under one would turn and kiss the book there is no place in the quran which requires acts of homosexuality to be punishable by lashings and death hadith or scripture scripture or rupture should i travel out from under the blanket comfort from a verse which also recurs “ surely there are signs in this for those of you who would reflect. ” or the one hundred and four books of god of which only four are known—qur ’ an injeel tavrat zubuur there are a hundred others—bhagavad-gita lotus sutra song of myself the gospel of magdalene popul vuh the book of black buffalo woman—somewhere unrevealed as such dear mother in the sky you could unbuckle the book and erase all the annotations what i always remember about my childhood is my mother whispering to me telling me secrets ideas suggestions she named me when i moved in her while she was reading a calligraphy of the imam ’ s names my name translated my whole life for me as patience in india we climbed the steps of the maula ali mountain to the top thirsting for what my mother had stayed behind in the house unable to go on pilgrimage she had told me the reason why being in a state considered unacceptable for prayers or pilgrimages i asked if she would want more children and she told me the name she would give a new son i always attribute the fact that they did not though my eldest sister ’ s first son was given the same name she whispered to me that afternoon to my telling of her secret to my sisters when we were climbing the stairs it is the one betrayal of her—perhaps meaningless—that i have never forgiven myself there are secrets it is still hard to tell betrayals hard to make you hope like anything that though others consider you unclean god will still welcome you my name is kazim which means patience i know how to wait

momentarily the language of description is lost what you see with your eyes is enough for you anyway but how to get the sense of what you saw across to another person it ’ s possible through the spirit in your voice when you say “ it was great ” to convey what happened in that moment it was great not only that it was terrific interesting too it was nice i had a good time doing it i had fun you should have been there not only that it was beautiful it was inspiring

not long ago i studied medicine it was terrible what the body told i ’ d look inside another person ’ s mouth and see the desolation of the world i ’ d see his genitals and think of sin because my body speaks the stranger ’ s language i ’ ve never understood those nods and stares my parents held me in their arms and still i think i ’ ve disappointed them they care and stare they nod they make their pilgrimage to somewhere distant in my heart they cry i look inside their other-person ’ s mouths and see the wet interior of souls it ’ s warm and red in there—like love with teeth i ’ ve studied medicine until i cried all night through certain books a truth unfolds anatomy and physiology the tiny sensing organs of the tongue— each nameless cell contributing its needs it was fabulous what the body told

in this land the children tear their hearts in half let me explain if ten things are wanted only ten can be had if a stand of birches is found to be made of tin the soil around them will bleed with rust in this land children study their magazines in broad daylight and in their books any soldier who stumbles will not fall no one will fall a gift parents try not to make much of at every meal some is set aside in every garden a patch lies fallow at parties there are whispers of illegal cheeses camembert especially is said to taste alive and so the children learn to make room to leave some nothing will come but nothing will go to love like this half must rattle in its pit

what a giant i must seem to them an exhausted giant who dozes above her sewing asleep in mid-stitch sorting the day ’ s haul of cinders rubies griefs— they were laughing and carrying on their tiny silver needles flying in and out tiny silver thimbles on their fingers it ’ s no use of course keeping secrets from them when chattering is almost their religion some held corners of the flag like an enormous quilt and some danced on little shelves above the workshop they were so merrie that i fell asleep again in the morning my beautiful flag was finished every stitch in place and every seam so now i raise it—slowly underneath a secret sky near the door to the half-daft and the cradle of kleptocracy where it rips and shivers rips and shivers once more and makes me furiously glad and fills me up with serious pleasure

they learned to turn off the gravity in an auditorium and we all rose into the air the same room where they demonstrated pow-wows and prestidigitation but not everyone believed it that was the most important lesson i learned—that a truck driven by a dog could roll down a hill at dusk and roll right off a dock into a lake and sink and if no one believes you then what is the point of telling them wonderful things i walked home from the pow-wow on an early winter night in amazement they let me buy the toy tomahawk as soon as i got home i was going to hit my sister with it but i didn ’ t know this

love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it camus all day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened keep the whole house tormented he is trying to reach the bees he is after bees this is the climax an end to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders last june on the porch floor i found them dead a sprinkle of dusty bugs and next day a still worse death until like falling in love bee-haunted i swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch i thought sickened and sickening me from what origin my life centered on bees all floors were suspect the search was hopeless windows were shut i never find where anything comes from but in june my husband ’ s fierce sallies began inspections cracks located and sealed insecticides shot outside the bees ’ course watched charted books on bees read i tell you i swept up bodies every day on the porch then they ’ d stop the problem was solved then they were there again as the feelings make themselves known again as they beseech sleepers who live innocently in will and mind it is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers that the bees were back no surprise to me but they had left themselves so lack-luster their black and gold furs so deathly faded gray bugs that the broom hunted were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch of heart takes place or a great shift of season november it came to an end no bees and i could watch the floor clean and cool and from windows the cold land but this spring the thing began again and his curse went upstairs again and his tinkering and reasoning and pride it is the man who takes hold i lived from bees but his force went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid and now in july he is tearing out the wall and each board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand it is quiet has been quiet for a while he calls me and i march from a dream of bees to see them winged and unwinged such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers— dirty clots of grubs sawdust stuck fliers all smeared together with old honey they writhe some of them but who cares they go to the garbage it is over everything has been said but there is more wouldn ’ t you think the bees had suffered enough this evening we go to a party the breeze dies late we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed we tell our funny story about the bees at two in the morning we come home and a friend a scientist comes with us in his car we ’ re going to save the idea of the thing a hundred bees if we can find so many unrotted still warm but harmless and leave the rest we hope that the neighbors are safe in bed taking no note of these private catastrophes he wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle not a bad thing to look into in the night we rattle and raise the lid of the garbage can flashlights in hand we open newspapers and the men reach in a salve of happenings i can ’ t touch it i hate the self-examined who ’ ve killed the self the dead are darker but the others have moved in the ooze toward the next moment my god one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes searching fingers sort and lay bare they need the idea of bees—and yet under their touch the craze for life gets stronger in the squirming whitish kind the men do it making a claim on the future as love makes a claim on the future grasping and i underhand i feel it start a terrible lifelong heave taking direction unpleading the men prod till all that grubby softness wants to give to give
1. mary-frances applied continual pressure on me to start the job and helped in recording and editing 2. thanks to sandra for her heroic typing although this need not be taken to indicate her agreement with various points 3. peter provided information about the notorious perpetual pills 4. as someone who gloried in seeing dogma overturned he would have delighted in the irony of seeing arguments for the reverse 5. and without their willingness to take on the chore of responding to our whims and fancies over a 3-year period this book would have fallen short of its goals 6. the production of this tome would have been unthinkable without the marvelous electronic tools that are now widely available 7. however chapter 7 was written in a relatively self- contained fashion so the serious student may skip chapter 6 and delve directly into the theory 8. the late abbess of shasta abbey proved that looking through different windows into the same room is not a metaphor 9. nick who is writing a book on oxygen gave much appreciated data concerning that element 10. the filmstrip format employed in chapter 10 originated with elizabeth 11. i have been very fortunate in being able to use such penetrating minds 12. in recent months i have often felt like a small child in a sweet shop as astronomers all round the world have sent me the most mouthwatering new data 13. suffice it at this point to observe that i am not just talking about wallpaper patterns on shirts and dresses although many of these patterns do turn out to have interesting properties 14. i do not expect that many readers will want to be masochistic enough to want to read the book in order from cover to cover

yesterday i found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work of fine winter work thrown aside were my cigarettes with all the childish joys of summer into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun the muslins illuminate and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed so as better to work but i was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me for hardly had i drawn the first puff when i forgot the grand books i was planning to write and amazed moved to a feeling of tenderness i breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me i had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to france and now all of london london as i had lived it a year ago entirely alone appeared before my eyes first the dear fogs that muffle one ’ s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements my tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch the big fires and the maid with red arms pouring coals and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive once again i saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—i saw the open sea crossed so often that winter shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved decked out in traveller ’ s clothes a long dress dull as the dust of the roads a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival mangled as they are by the sea and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever
in the muddy maze of some old neighborhood often where the street lamp gleams like blood as the wind whips the flame rattles the glass where human beings ferment in a stormy mass one sees a ragpicker knocking against the walls paying no heed to the spies of the cops his thralls but stumbling like a poet lost in dreams he pours his heart out in stupendous schemes he takes great oaths and dictates sublime laws casts down the wicked aids the victims cause beneath the sky like a vast canopy he is drunken of his splendid qualities yes these people plagued by household cares bruised by hard work tormented by their years each bent double by the junk he carries the jumbled vomit of enormous paris — they come back perfumed with the smell of stale wine-barrels followed by old comrades pale from war mustaches like limp flags to march with banners flowers through the triumphal arch erected for them by some magic touch and in the dazzling deafening debauch of bugles sunlight of huzzas and drum bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home even so wine pours its gold to frivolous humanity a shining pactolus then through man 's throat of high exploits it sings and by its gifts reigns like authentic kings to lull these wretches sloth and drown the hate of all who mutely die compassionate god has created sleep 's oblivion man added wine divine child of the sun

everything except act and go an ’ hear ‘ em but when they are through come to the bolsheviki… and when it broke there was the crowd there and the cossacks just as always before but one thing the cossacks said “ pojalouista. ” and that got round in the crowd and then a lieutenant of infantry ordered ‘ em to fire into the crowd in the square at the end of the nevsky in front of the moscow station and they wouldn ’ t and he pulled his sword on a student for laughing and killed him and a cossack rode out of his squad on the other side of the square and cut down the lieutenant of infantry and there was the revolution… as soon as they named it and you can ’ t make ‘ em nobody knew it was coming they were all ready the old gang guns on the top of the post-office and the palace but none

the landscape the landscape again gloucester the shore one of me is duplicates and from which from offshore i maximus am removed observe in this night i moved on the territory with combinations new mixtures of old and known personages the leader my father in an old guise here selling books and manuscripts my thought was as i looked in the window of his shop there should be materials here for maximus when then i saw he was the young musician has been there been before me before it turned out it wasn ’ t a shop it was a loft wharf- house in which as he walked me around a year ago came back i had been there before with my wife and son i didn ’ t remember he presented me insinuations via himself and his girl both of whom i had known for years but never in gloucester i had moved them in to my country his previous appearance had been in my parents ’ bedroom where i found him intimate with my former wife this boy was now the librarian of gloucester massachusetts black space old fish-house motions of ghosts i dogging his steps he not my father by name himself with his face twisted at birth possessed of knowledge pretentious giving me what in the instant i knew better of but the somber place the flooring crude like a wharf ’ s and a barn ’ s space i was struck by the fact i was in gloucester and that my daughter was there—that i would see her she was over the cut i hadn ’ t even connected her with my being there that she was here that she was there in the promised land—the cut but there was this business of poets that all my jews were in the fish-house too that the librarian had made a party i was to read they were there were many of them slumped around it was not for me i was outside it was the fort the fort was in east gloucester—old gorton ’ s wharf where the library was it was a region of coal houses bins in one a gang was beating someone to death in a corner of the labyrinth of fences i could see their arms and shoulders whacking down but not the victim i got out of there but cops tailed me along the fort beach toward the tavern the places still half-dark mud coal dust there is no light east of the bridge only on the headland toward the harbor from cressy ’ s have i seen it once when my daughter ran out on a spit of sand isn ’ t even there where is bristow when does i-a get me home i am caught in gloucester what ’ s buried behind lufkin ’ s diner who is frank moore
today in el paso all the planes are asleep on the runway the world is in a delay all the political consultants drinking whiskey keep their heads down lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace they jingle when she brings them drinks outside the giant plate glass windows the planes are completely covered in snow it piles up on the wings i feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers each of the various faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected i don ’ t want to talk on the phone to an angel at night before i go to sleep i am already dreaming of coffee of ancient generals of the faces of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings i examine my feelings without feeling anything i ride my blue bike on the edge of the desert i am president of this glass of water
1 the clouds part revealing a mythology of clouds assembled in light of earliest birds an originary text over water over time and that without which the clouds part revealing an apology for clouds implicit in the air where the clouds had been recently witnessed rehearsing departure a heartfelt phrase in the push of the airborne drops and crystals over water over time—how being made to think oneself an obstruction between the observer and the object or objects under surveillance or even desired—or if i am felt to be beside the point then i have wanted that but to block a path is like not being immaterial enough or being too much when all they want from you now is your station cleared of its personal effects please and vanish— not that they ’ d ever just come out and say it when all that darting around of the eyes all that shaky camouflage of paper could only portend the beginning of the end of your tenure at this organization and remember a capacity to draw meaning out of such seeming accidence landed one here to begin with didn ’ t it 2 the clouds part revealing an anatomy of clouds viewed from the midst of human speculation a business project undertaken in a bid to acquire and retain control of the formation and movement of clouds as late afternoons i have witnessed the distant towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun in-box empty surround sound on all my money made in lieu of conversation—where conversation indicates the presence of desire in the parties to embark on exchange of spirit hours forzando with heartfelt phrase— made metaphor for it the face on the clock tower bright as a meteor as if a torch were held against likelihood to illuminate the time so i could watch the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury appointments of my office suite the tumult below or behind me out of mind had not my whole attention been riveted by the human figure stood upon the tower ’ s topmost pinnacle himself surveying the clouds of the future parting in antiquity a figure not to be mistaken tranquilly pacing a platform with authority the chief executive officer of clouds 3 the clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds built in glass-front factories carved into cliff-faces which prior to the factories ’ recent construction provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons a species revered in ancient egypt as attendants of thoth god of wisdom science and measurement fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts can be heard from up to a mile away depending on air temperature humidity the absence or presence of any competing sound its origin and its character it is no more impossible to grasp the baboon ’ s full significance in egyptian religious symbolism than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture provoke in an audience more positive lasting response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature even those who consider natural clouds products of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely human mind lie behind the products they admire this development may be a form of self-exalting or else another adaptation in order that we find the hum of machinery comforting through darkness 4 the clouds part revealing there ’ s no place left to sit myself down except for a single wingback chair backed into a corner to face the window in which the clouds part revealing the insouciance of clouds cavorting over the backs of the people in the field who cut the ripened barley who gather it in sheaves who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off the chaff as the grain falls to the floor who collect the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it into flour who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer in the sanctuary its walls washed white like milk to perform it repeatedly to perform it each time as if the first to walk the dim corridor believing that the conference it leads to might change everything to adhere to a possibility of reward of betterment of moving above with effort the condition into which one has been born to whom do i owe the pleasure of the hum to which i have been listening too long 5 the clouds part revealing the advocates of clouds believers in people ideas and things the workers of the united fields of clouds supporters of the wars to keep clouds safe the devotees of heartfelt phrase and belief you can change with water over time it is the habit of a settled population to give ear to whatever is desirable will come to pass a caressing confidence—but one unfortunately not borne out by human experience for most things people desire have been desired ardently for thousands of years and observe—they are no closer to realization today than in ramses ’ time nor is there cause to believe they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow attempts to speed them on have been undertaken from the beginning plans to force them overnight are in copious antagonistic operation today and yet they have thoroughly eluded us and chances are they will continue to elude us until the clouds part in a flash of autonomous ardent local brainwork— but when the clouds start to knit back together again we ’ ll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission 6 the clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies united into one immaterial body a fictive person around whom the air is blurred with money force from which much harm will come to whom my welfare matters nothing i sense without turning the light from their wings their eyes they preen themselves on the fire escape the windowsill their pink feet vulnerable—a mistake to think of them that way if i turn around the room might not be full of wings capable of acting in many respects as a single being which is to say that i myself may be the source of what i sense but am no less powerless to change it always around me on my body in my mouth i fear them and their love of money everything i do without thinking to help them make it and if i am felt to be beside the point i have wanted that to live apart from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep itself alive and yet not happily with all its needs and comforts met but fattened so far past that point i am engrossed and if i picture myself outside of it it isn ’ t me anymore but a parasite cast out inviable 7 the clouds part revealing the distinction between words without meaning and meaning without words a phenomenon of nature the westbound field of low air pressure developing over water over time and warm saturated air on the sea surface rising steadily replaced by cold air from above the cycle repeating the warm moving upward into massive thunderclouds the cold descending into the eye around which bands of thunderclouds spiral counter- clockwise often in the hundreds the atmospheric pressure dropping even further making winds accelerate the clouds revolve a confusion of energy an incomprehensible volume of rain—i remember the trick of thinking through infinity a crowd of eyes against an asphalt wall my vision of it scrolling left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then just black until i fall asleep and then just black again past marketing past focus groups past human resources past management past personal effects their insignificance evident in the eye of the dream and through much of the debriefing i wake into next
we forget that we are all dead men conversing with dead men —jorge luis borges for the first time on the road north of tampico i felt the life sliding out of me a drum in the desert harder and harder to hear i was seven i lay in the car watching palm trees swirl a sickening pattern past the glass my stomach was a melon split wide inside my skin “ how do you know if you are going to die ” i begged my mother we had been traveling for days with strange confidence she answered “ when you can no longer make a fist. ” years later i smile to think of that journey the borders we must cross separately stamped with our unanswerable woes i who did not die who am still living still lying in the backseat behind all my questions clenching and opening one small hand

and this my hand against my self uprear — william shakespeare i took the crooked arcade-overshadowed road off the main square built by de chirico and chanced upon a watch repairer ’ s shop which might have been painted by bhupen khakhar for whose summer show the london weeklies have just prepared such a frosty welcome wait is this ekphrastic or oneiric the site bologna or bombay are the hanging watches so sure of their gender bulgari or janata too early to tell but there he sat at his workbench working at what looked like tiny jeweled bits of time laid out under his eye loupe in magnolia light these fragments he seemed to be reassembling into a perfect circle or a sphere seen from above — it was like a miracle obligingly performed in slow motion or the flight of an arrow broken down into ever smaller fractions of advancement he took his time and my time to acknowledge me — clearly he didn ’ t crave an audience as though the slow work that so ravished him required if not secrecy at least discretion could he mend i wondered the cracked glass on my watch before i had to leave tomorrow his black eyes rested on the old omega as though bemused such a watch should belong to someone so importunate then he cleared the air with a lenient experienced smile certo but it will have a different bombatura not quite as fine as this one was though the word was unfamiliar it conjured up at once light skating the rim of a sheer bevel va bene so long i thought as i can tell the time and don ’ t have to squint through cracks as i had since fending off a drunken punch which i ’ d provoked myself enough to throw i would have paid extra to watch him clean the face with the wad of turquoise putty he had to hand paid double to have devanagari numerals replace the roman but he wanted me out a domani allora then as i left he said it needed una revisione completa before it got too late a watch like this deserves — he changed the tense — deserved a lot more care

long after the sun falls into the sea and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet and the air gets soaked in blackness long after clouds hover above like boulders and stars crawl up and stud the sky long after bodies tangle dance and falter and fatigue blows in and bends them and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them a girl unlatches a window walks shoeless into a forest her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness she walks into woods her feet light-stepping through puddles over hard packed dirt through grassy hills over sticks and pebbles over sand soaked in day stones sun-sizzled over lakes and frigid streams through dim cobbled streets darkened squares and dusty pastures she runs from nothing runs to nothing beyond pain beyond graveyards and clearings in the dark the eyes of startled creatures gleam like a herd of candles they scatter and give night its meaning what echo of a bell lulled her what spirit what scent of a word whose storm wrote her what banks fell to drown her which blood star which thread of water which trickle of light whose heart being launched whose floating soul seduced her what promise did it make her whose memory burned her whose prayer did she run to answer whose help what sorrow clot what pain dammed inside her what wall must she rebuild now whose treasure beckons her who spread ivy like a veil to blind her daybreak lies chained to a blue wall from which the stars drop and lose all meaning she runs past villages that lost their names roads that lost their destinations seas that lost their compasses and sailors rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers houses that lost their sleepers and criers trees that lost their songs and shadows gardens that lost their violets and benches valleys that lost their worms and farmers mountains that lost their prophets and marauders temples that lost their sinners and spires lightning that lost its silver and wires chimeras that lost their bridges minotaurs that lost their fountains crescent moons hover above her ancient white feathers birdless wingless lost to their own meaning music rises out of her vision it stands a wall covered with silver mosses a clarinet sounds a wounded mare violins women who lost their children flutes blow their hot dry breezes drums chuckle the earth ’ s ceaseless laughter pianos are mumbling sorcerers calling spirits and powers cellos chew on the sounds of thunder dulcimers skip about on crutches dance floors flash their knives daring their dancers words mill about the streets like orphans then a lute begins groaning and dawn loses its meaning night girl night girl your book is full now you have drawn all the pictures you have seen many weepers stars held your sky in place and moons floated on your lakes and washed them when a bird sings when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes when curtains are soaked with light when mirrors drown in shadows take your day to the shore my child put out the words that fired your waking scatter them on the sand like seeds then with your feet gently tap them and let the bright waves receive your meaning

1. look here marcus aurelius we ’ ve come to see your temple deluded the guards crawled through a hole in the fence why your descendent my guide and friend has opted for secrecy i don ’ t know but i do know what to call the africans passport-less yellow-eyed who will ride the boat before me for naples they hope here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter storm like a cough or the seadog drops them at hannibal ’ s shores where they ’ ll stand stupefied like his elephants what dimension of time will they cross at the hours loop tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists what siren song will the trucks shipping them back to ouagadougou drone into their ears i look at them loitering waiting for the second act of their darkness to fall i look at the sky shake her dicey fists one can be thankful i suppose for not being one of them and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself to keep the cold wind at bay but what world is this that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon ’ s rope is about to snap while the sea and sky ache to become an open-ended road that ’ s what we ’ re all waiting for a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit and let us in on its sweetness as we wait smoking or fondling provisions listening the engine ’ s invocational purr in an hour that will dawn and dusk at once one that will stretch into days strung like beads on the horizon ’ s throat they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star begins to float on the water so bright and still you ’ d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand 2. a pair of roman fists robbed of spear and shield the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn that slipped from the buttery hands aluminum wrappers smudged with processed cheese countless cigarette butts surround the fallen columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion… the ruins are not ruined without all this garbage packed stratified how else to name our age 3. earlier i had walked the market of sabratha changed to its people but like my old city brought me back to me the petty merchants all selling the same goods shouted out jokes to each other a sudanese waiter carried a tray with a giant pot of green tea with mint among the older men their heads capped with crimson shennas i kept seeking my father ’ s face an old lust wafted past me when the abaya-clad women scented with knock-off chanel sashayed by the sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves with spoons of searing harissa my mouth watering to a childhood burn pyramids of local oranges late season pomegranates radish and turnip bulbs stacked like billiard balls and the half carcasses of lambs as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks the trays of hearts kidneys brains and testicles arrayed in slick arabesques the hand-woven rugs where the extinct mouflon thrives mincers hairdryers and toasters their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves it was as if my eyes were painting not seeing what i saw my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole what face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration i know what the eyes of the men my age said settled now in comfortable middle age about the life i left behind true i did envy them the asceticism of their grace where a given horizon becomes a birthright—to drive or walk past the same hills all your life to eat from the same tree and drink from the well that gave you your name 4. though for centuries the locals broke the statues ’ limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery enough remains to echo all that has disappeared you and the woman leave the towpath and you brace her against the trunk of an oak it ’ s not the moonlight but refractions from suburban homes trapped under cloud-cover that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees first god made love the canopy like the inside of an emerald her lips a rush of cochineal then a route of evanescence brought her from carthage into these living arms here 5 “ a nice time “ he tells us how he and four cousins crossed the desert heading home on top of three-years ’ worth of meager pay the tarp ballooning a giant dough roped to a truck wearing the goggles of the welder he 'd hoped to become he looked at the sky and wondered “ what those flying smoke on their tails thought of us. ” later deported in a cargo plane he handed the tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports and they like “ space aliens ” in shabby uniforms sunglasses tribal veils poured into his face as the propellers ’ hammering calmed to a shuddering hum he saw the stars “ hundreds of them like gnats ” swarm mt akakous ’ peak “ my next road is the water ” he says serving us tonight and we promise if the coffee is good to put him on the next boat to the moon shining over syracuse 6. suddenly i find your descendant ’ s hands leafing through my chapters scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts “ how is it ” he asks “ that starlight announces the hour how can a song divide desire in two ” “ my flame ” i must have written or said “ coated her body like silk one kiss spreading threads of lightening into her pores until she became a sob barely lifted by the wind and i became mist the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn. ” to that he responds “ a platonic echo ” and “ what will come of such a plasticine love ” marcus aurelius your descendent knows i ’ ll leave as i arrive so empty he gets lost in me 7. two centuries ago one of my ancestors sat on one of the communal latrines in mid-morning and listened to apuleius ’ s defense across from him on that marble hexagon sat two other men on normal days they ’ d have talked about the olive harvest the feast of venus coming soon but today they listen to the madaurian ’ s high eloquence studded with jokes cracking their own one-liners shaking their heads in delight away from the hot midday sun and the throngs you could say they had the best seats in the house and so they lingered and heard as much as they could then went about their business so what if a man maries an older woman for her money what impoverished young roman in his right mind wouldn ’ t do that and sure too if some man comes to take your inheritance even if he ’ s your best friend even if he takes good care of your mother you ’ d be a fool not to sue him to the council even if you ’ d have to accuse him falsely of black magic that ’ s the beauty of it or rather whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty that things being already right can be more right which is what “ beautiful ” really means and what better way to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life 8. marcus aurelius the men at the shore follow your path into eternity though they already see their journey as a quarrel with circumstance their lives abscesses feeding on the universe ’ s hide tumors in detention camps in basement kitchens their pockets filled with drachmas they ’ ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame one of them is now driving a taxi in thessaloniki or perugia with enough of the language to understand direction he engages his late night passengers in the light of the dashboard they ’ ll entrust him with their secrets with time he ’ ll become a light unto himself his car a winged chariot of human folly and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark soil of philosophy it ’ s the gift of seasons that stray from the earth when soul reigns incidental to flesh forgiving to no end a light that has long surpassed itself 9. the birds that drew the line to the first distance remain nameless to me— creamy white breasts

inescapable destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies “ lacking the poverty of the rich ” he ’ s splurged a month-long trip to the olympic games and openhanded he gifted his mentors their daughters ’ doweries few return to madaura once gone and when heading back shamefaced like him they ’ d do as he did taking the longest route hoping the journey would never end here in sabratha the widow hooked him or he let her reel him and that ’ s how that sordid business happily ended as it began i look out toward madaura my back to the theater and the latrines madaura birthplace of augustine site of his first schooling—little augustine holding a satchel of scrolls and a loaf of bread for the teacher awakened by his mother his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals his stomach warm with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make forced to slurp it sweetened with honey from the atlas a sprinkling of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm if the world is that sweet and warm if it is that mothering why then this perpetual scene of separation this turning out into the cold toward something he knew he ’ d love he lets go of the neighbors ’ boy ’ s hand warming his own he refuses the warm porridge forever renounces his mother ’ s embrace it only lasted a month this partial answer because even then everyone knew that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens and deepens like the sea before them a place meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth that ’ s why prophets were welcomed here calmly because god was like rain and they like the saplings which know only the first verse to the sky ’ s rainless hymn and that ’ s why africa ’ s tallest minaret looms unfinished

history here to enable anyone to finish the thought it ’ s useless then to track the fate of these travelers some without life jackets had never learned how to swim why not let them live in text as they do in life —they ’ ve lived without words for so long—why not release them from the pen ’ s anchor and let them drift to their completion 11. in a few weeks you ’ ll see pedants here with

slaughter a rooster douse blood on the dido figurehead adorning the prow the seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah his egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater twists the brass head into it caking the slit with sand he fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco wraps it with foil pokes it tenderly with a knife he picks embers from the going fire places a few on the aluminum crown and inhales and blows until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog the color of semen i think then hands the pipe hose to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over to the travelers in turn the air smells sweet around us the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine their communion done they embark except the one who stands the dead rooster in his hand as if wanting to entrust it to us then digs a hurried hole to bury it in the boat barely visible leaves a leaden lacey ribbon aiming directly for the burnt orange sun as it reddens for a moment their

lostness is the you are here the red star that the mall map linked to gps as if you ’ d stared into your nowhere like a sun and photoreceptors compensated with a point lostness is an immaculately well-dressed person or a room laid out like charcuterie it ’ s a feeling someone loves you after a ten-minute talk oh yes but lostness is loving someone too knowing you would take the raft out further if it meant a few more minutes sometimes i want to tell my dog that i ’ m the only one in the world who knows her whereabouts and that ’ s lostness but it ’ s lived in it isn ’ t sadness lostness is the job i had in ’ 98 in a warehouse unpacking chic decor where i began to unravel and unmake the very things the company was selling it was the boxes i moved forward on the shelves until they lined up well pop choruses that played again for the beautiful and found it ’ s almost gladness it ’ s the walk i took one day trying to decide should i live in montreal and thinking that i knew something to make it plain lostness is the many rains of money that i once watched from an open window it ’ s long been here it was the semilunate carpal flowering in late-cretaceous bones where everything was going then never more unclear it was the first prokaryote closing off its little o and all that it could be instead but lostness is a steady wage i remember when my grandfather would come home from the squats and thousand double checks of electrical work and wash his hands all the dirt moved in his laundry sink like garter snakes that turned up under stones a living current so bearable in its lostness that i could know it only for a hundred years and still be happy lostness was the school i went to where leaving crumbs on rectangles of paper meant showing the way someone would have to come it was having your knapsack up on the table like a personal flotation device it wouldn ’ t be wrong to say that lostness is always there on the lip of everything like lichen or a bomb there is a loving lostness that if you look deep into you see a great balance beam that everything that was or is or that may be is standing on
i ’ d often seen the runway kissed by refugees and bought-out hostages an odd drunk and those renouncing the flying for good and thought that surely there must be worse places to touch freedom between the tailfins and the gray town in the distance gravity cropped up only at a newsstand and fizzled out with the first bite of the octane damp the view of the parking bunkers and stacked hovels by the motorway everything else before and after could have fitted into half a cigarette the sickly sunshine and endless nights the flags and oaths the very language i wanted to forget the celts the saxons the housebroken vikings in crowded trains hopping frozen behind stalls selling tat to tourists not enough time for loving because of other loves nor codebooks nor guides except the perennial a to z of not giving offense the words were always there smooth like pebbles soap on the tongue and sometimes the mockery of a commonplace like that time when we put up a blackened union jack instead of curtains between us and the poles on the scaffolding across the road on occasions it seemed good enough to be happy or scared with the rest to bring home from the terraces and parades that sly acceptance to sit in the shadow of atavism as under a palm tree and chew blissfully on the sweet dirt the taste of the crowd or for an evening make a shortcut through someone else ’ s work an incomer ’ s story of a homeland gained not lost a fat compendium of patriotic verse in essence cheat again in other words — never spend too much on a suit rarely worn ... if there had been loyalty at all it fell on faces and disappeared with them on promises and smiles crazy schemes for finding undiscovered shores the world i thought could be unfolded anywhere if only you could fit it into a travel bag into a clear irrevocable word it is strange perhaps that even today i think the same still in the same place buried firmly like a rock in a graveyard as heavy and as pointlessly decorated by lightness the vows of yesterday skim the heights like animal shapes we recognize in passing clouds postcards sleep in the unread books just like the nomadic tribes used to i learn of myself only with my feet now from the single map that remained and when streets bring the shortened future a bit nearer with open palm i seek the roughness of the facades and in the friendly pain i find the coarse unperfected truth of things this i think then must be what it ’ s like in the bellies of gigantic animals wet and quiet almost pleasant once you get used to the smell of those who passed through before you and the immutable truth that there is no going forward or anywhere else ... translated from the bosnian
they work fingers to bone borrow smudged paper then make promises to family unmerciful gods the unborn some eat a favorite meal three times in a row others partake only a pinch of soil before boarding half-broken boats rubber rafts — half of the young women big with life inside them flesh blood for daydreams of the arabian nights as makeshift charts constellations work their way through war rumors of war the smugglers count their loot hard winds rattle gongs over sea salt till the rusty engines die cries alert mermaid sirens as pirated schooners adrift under a mute sky rock to fro the fight goes out of the few alive their loved ones friends lost folk songs mountains valleys all left behind searchlights spot the dead hugging the living draglines raise only those who were braver than us the lucky ones stumble out of stupor tried by raging water beneath black skies listening to the albatross talk

is surely a peculiar answer for any teacher to receive when asking a kindergartner but on second take what word best describes me crossbreed of butterfly and super fly aesthetics other than peculiar i suppose calling me a keen kid would also suffice in explaining my avidity for the kind of death that progresses the narrative of a gentling history because that ’ s the only frame for greatness i seem to find for boys my shade and age to aspire to short of having the height and hops to touch the rim or the bulk and burst to break through the defensive line like a bullet and no i haven ’ t given up on the prospect of bulls starting shooting guard yet but the god-fearer impressed upon me begs the mythology of goodness delivered to the multitudes like loaves and fish how king is talked about in a black christian tradition still in mourning over his lost rays of light the way mentioning the name of malcolm makes mice of shady white men some thirty years after the shotgun and he ’ s sung of as a prince i want to evoke that level of pride in american democracy ’ s dark downtrodden because i know what it invokes in me young and impressionable watching denzel ’ s mimicry for the one millionth time in my abbreviated existence — drawing an x on my undeveloped chest pushing it out into the unknown-ahead hoping a mecca for melanin rises from the man-shaped hole i ’ d left in my loved ones ’ lives i bet my parents would be so proud of me i bet post offices would close on my birthday i bet god would dap me up when i got up there and jesus — dying on a cross to meet me
i can now confirm that i am not just fatter than everyone i work with but i ’ m also fatter than all their spouses even the heavily bearded bear in accounting has a little otter-like boyfriend when my co-workers brightly introduce me as “ the funny one in the office ” their spouses give them a look which translates to well duh then they both wait for me to say something funny a gaggle of models comes shrieking into the bar to further punctuate why i sometimes hate living in this city they glitter a shiny gang of scissors i don ’ t know how to look like i ’ m not struggling sometimes on the subway back to queens i can tell who ’ s staying on past the lexington stop because i have bought their shoes before at payless they are shoes that fool absolutely no one everyone wore their special holiday party outfits it wasn ’ t until i arrived at the bar that i realized my special holiday party outfit was exactly the same as the outfits worn by the restaurant ’ s busboys while i ’ m standing in line for the bathroom another patron asks if i ’ m there to clean it
my husband and i were arguing about a bench we wanted to buy and put in part of our backyard a part which is actually a meadow of sorts a half acre with tall grasses and weeds and the occasional wild flower because we do not mow it but leave it scrubby and unkempt this bench would hardly ever be used and in summer when the grasses were high would remain partially hidden from view we both knew we wanted the bench to be made of teak so that it would last a long time in the harsh weather and so that we would never have to paint it teak weathers to a soft silver that might in november or march disappear into the gray hills that are the backdrop of our lives my husband wanted a four foot bench and i wanted a five foot bench this is what we argued about my husband insisted that a four foot bench was all we needed since no more than two people presumably ourselves would ever sit on it at the same time i felt his reasoning was not only beside the point but missed it entirely i said what mattered most to me was the idea of the bench the look of it there to be gazed at with only the vaguest notion it could hold more people than would ever actually sit down the life of the bench in my imagination was more important than any practical function the bench might serve after all i argued we wanted a bench so that we could look at it so that we could imagine sitting on it so that unexpectedly a bird might sit on it or fallen leaves or inches of snow and the longer the bench the greater the expanse of that plank the more it matched its true function which was imaginary my husband mentioned money and i said that i was happier to have no bench at all which would cost nothing than to have a four foot bench which would be expensive i said that having no bench at all was closer to the five foot bench than the four foot bench because having no bench served the imagination in similar ways and so not having a bench became an option in our argument became a third bench we grew very tired of discussing the three benches and for a day we rested from our argument during this day i had many things to do and many of them involved my driving past other houses none of which had benches that is they each had the third bench and as i drove past the other houses i could see a bench here and a bench there sometimes i saw the bench very close to the house against a wall or on a porch and sometimes i saw the bench under a tree or in the open grass cut or uncut and once i saw the bench at the end of the driveway blocking the road always it was a five foot bench that i saw a long sleek bench or a broken down bench a bench with a slatted back or a bench with a solid carved back and always the bench was empty but i knew that for my husband the third bench was only four feet long and he saw always two people sitting on it two happy or tired people two people who were happy to be alive or two people tired from having worked hard enough to buy the bench they were sitting on or they were happy and tired happy to have reached the end of some argument tired from having had it for these people the bench was an emblem of their days which were fruitful because their suffering had come to an end on my bench which was always empty nothing had come to an end because nothing had begun no one had sat down though the bench was always there waiting for exactly that to happen and the bench was always long enough so that someone if he desired to could lie all the way down that day passed another day followed it and my husband and i began once more to discuss the bench the sound of our voices revealed a renewed interest and vigor i thought i sensed in him a coming around to my view of the bench and i know he sensed in me a coming around to his view of the bench because at one point i said that a four foot bench reminded me of rough notes towards a real bench while a five foot bench was like a fragment of an even longer bench and i admitted it was at times hard to tell the difference he said he didn ’ t know anything about the difference between rough notes and fragments but he agreed that between the two benches there was possibly just perhaps—he could imagine it—very little difference it was after all only a foot we were talking about and i think it was then in both of our minds that a fourth bench came into being a bench that was only a foot long a miniature bench a bench we could build ourselves though of course we did not this seemed to be essentially the bench we were talking about much later when the birds came back or the leaves drifted downwards or the snow fell slowly and lightly at first then heavier and faster it was this bench that we both saw when we looked out the window at the bench we eventually placed in the meadow which continued to grow as if there were no bench at all
i just didn ’ t get it— even with the teacher holding an orange the earth in one hand and a lemon the moon in the other her favorite student the sun standing behind her with a flashlight i just couldn ’ t grasp it— this whole citrus universe these bumpy planets revolving so slowly no one could even see themselves moving i used to think if i could only concentrate hard enough i could be the one person to feel what no one else could sense a small tug from the ground a sky shift the earth changing gears even though i was only one mini-speck on a speck even though i was merely a pinprick in one goosebump on the orange i was sure then i was the most specially perceptive perceptively sensitive i was sure then my mother was the only mother to snap “ the world doesn ’ t revolve around you ” the earth was fragile and mostly water just the way the orange was mostly water if you peeled it just the way i was mostly water if you peeled me looking back on that third grade science demonstration i can understand why some people gave up on fame or religion or cures— especially people who have an understanding of the excruciating crawl of the world who have a well-developed sense of spatial reasoning and the tininess that it is to be one of us but not me—even now i wouldn ’ t mind being god the force who spins the planets the way i spin a globe a basketball a yoyo i wouldn ’ t mind being that teacher who chooses the fruit or that favorite kid who gives the moon its glow
when i came to my mother ’ s house the day after she had died it was already a museum of her unfinished gestures the mysteries from the public library due in two weeks the half-eaten square of lasagna in the fridge the half-burned wreckage of her last cigarette and one red swallow of wine in a lipsticked glass beside her chair finally a blue bic on a couple of downs and acrosses left blank in the sunday crossword which actually had the audacity to look a little smug at having for once won
if walking like wine only abets a sad mood let ’ s try it i said and i did over these hills that have never known sorrow no thoughtful moon passes dig until a hill is level and unearth only earth take pride in knowing the chemical makeup of rain the sum total of harmful vapors in any sunset for if you must drag in the old lines about suicidal willows star ’ s stacked for or against you you clutter a limitless soaring landscape with your own baggage night of love day of omens of night great mountain of realized hopes valley where bitter winds blow the dispossessed into raving lunatics— what are they but shady projections of passing whims vastly oversimplified versions of something infinitely greater this vision before you is nothing but a triad of trees hills river steadfast and eternal but soon you start to feel restless and when setting out to take a roll of photos you note the disturbing absence of a road your suavity crumbles you deafen the sky and serenade the moon fall prostrate before pines saying oh come back spirit of the place which lifeless without you blossoms into something sumptuously more than mediating madness come back massive oaks that await our coming to carve initials is to be truly human the days are dappled with our passions the mountains rise and fall with our glories and follies
i hate the travel logs that tell you more about the pain than the place yet here i am again narrating the same old story to myself time after time the papers circling in an alley watched by a hunchback mimic my plans and their preventer when an old man treats the drycleaner to a lengthy sermon on spotting i collect it bloated clouds spell messages that people stopped hearing long ago and as for the hag who runs at me arms open mouth bleeding she ’ s my future my terrible double always i head out hot for details and always the details start revolving around brave ingénues who put their innocent hands in wicked bonfires i could never go for ten minutes without seeing fissures as faces and i confess a hopeless weakness for the types who come back from travels gather their fans around and tell them stories of order or of wonder seashores and meadows sometimes get so muffled and many-voiced that tourists storm in and do their talking for them— it ’ s addictive magical vital but i ’ ve observed how more and more these promising outings are becoming meta-walks and mechanized phrases “ when i ventured into the outback how it blared back echoes of me my bright dreams and tragic uniqueness. ” meanwhile forces of good and evil squirm and flourish under the carpet mocking the visionary moment ’ s sweeping appeal i ’ ll go on going out for scenes of horror and pleasure but i ’ ll start pursuing clues leading to the return of that enormous fertile ground between shouting and silence
she was cleaning—there is always that to do—when she found at the top of the closet his old silk vest she called me to look at it unrolling it carefully like something live might fall out then we spread it on the kitchen table and smoothed the wrinkles down making our hands heavy until its shape against formica came back and the little tips that would have pointed to his pockets lay flat the buttons were all there i held my arms out and she looped the wide armholes over them “ that ’ s one thing i never wanted to be ” she said “ a man. ” i went into the bathroom to see how i looked in the sheen and sadness wind chimes off-key in the alcove then her crying so i stood back in the sink-light where the porcelain had been staring time to go to her i thought with that other mind and stood still
i take my dinners alone in my room but i can still hear them through the door my father ’ s false teeth clicking like a wooden gate with a metal latch swinging open swinging closed in a water glass at night they float like an exhibit in formaldehyde of a stillborn child the nightlight shining through the glass— a spelunker ’ s flashlight in an underwater cave illuminating the fossilized toothed beak of a fierce bird now extinct my father ’ s false teeth when he tries to spit in the toilet fall in only my hand is small enough to reach underwater into the hole and pull them out from the pipe where they are wedged sideways slightly open sometimes a woman expels from her womb something that is all hair and teeth george washington was said to always dine alone his teeth were made of wood whalebone and mastodon ivory my father ’ s false teeth god ’ s first clumsy attempt at wings two imprints of a horse ’ s hooves in red clay hinged together ringed with small square bones too heavy to ever fly my father ’ s false teeth in the click of computer keys in the tick tick of the eucalyptus outside the window as it twists out of its skin that falls on the pavement like sheets of parchment a faraway splash in the middle of the night i sit up in bed startled— it was george washington throwing something across the delaware not a coin but his teeth
i. the worker ’ s pants on a spider-filament line strung waist to waist to waist to dry the neat green wedge of park always empty the length of concrete paced by convalescents the lead impastos of interesting weather though mostly the shadowless blue of long days the sprawl of water beyond the band of beach copper or tinfoil depending on the sun coming down the moon rising the storefront and the thumb of hydrant in front of it in all kinds of light solidly composed and unspeculative the garage ’ s brick side facing a warehouse wall between them the alley ’ s cold black aisle the swells of a scalloped awning the sheetlike descent of streetwise birds tubercular with rust the flue leaking steam and behind the blind-eye panes the figure who must have chosen to be here ii at a window someone watches for daybreak which begins for him with a spar of sun lighting a stringcourse on the opposite building its tendrils and blooms freshly chiseled when mornings have an acidly clean brightness or mildewed chalky with soot when the overcast will not pull back from the day hobbled now but still ardent wandering he looks at the postcards showing the city and its lit grids touches mangoes going soft in crates and listens always for the murmurings an object after all is what makes infinity private spare a dollar for a lobotomy everything taken up pocketed added to an accrual having less to do with weight than with lightness the plane of a wall say with pink stucco rough as emery and the little fish green as muscat grapes selling out at a dime a dozen iii fender-chrome gravel molars brittle sepals holding up the dead rose the bottle collecting rain—a precise light found for each like the faded brown for leaves ground-down crystal for frost the formless moil of paint spread into surface depicts the day exact so with the persimmons almost forgotten into ordinariness the moons of candle-wax on the table—things clearer somehow for entering the orange brown and white i make use of rising i am elated by the light on cold red leaves and on successive clouds each one edge-lit its heart incinerate and the light makes use of me in ways only line curve and shadow can describe drawn toward what pity or love that the day emptied but unsubdued gives in to every day he poured himself into it as water might pour from a flask
when i get up he has been long at work his brush limber against the house seeing him on his ladder under the eaves i look back on myself asleep in the dream i could not carry awake sleep inside a house that is being painted whole lifetimes now only the familiar cast of morning light over the prayer plant this “ not remembering ” is something new of where you have been what was settled or unsettled in sleep stays there but your house under this steady arm is leaving itself and you see this gradual surface of new light covering your sleep has the greater power you think now you felt brush strokes or the space between them a motion bearing down on you—accumulation of stars each night of them arranging over the roofs of entire cities his careful strokes whiten the web the swirl of woodgrain blotted out like a breath stopped at the heart nothing has changed you say faithlessly but something has cleansed you past recognition when you stand near his ladder looking up he does not acknowledge you and as from daylight in a dream you see your house has passed from you into the blessed hands of others this is ownership you think arriving in the heady afterlife of paint smell a deep opening goes on in you some paint has dropped onto your shoulder as though light concealed an unsuspected weight you think it has fallen through you you think you have agreed to this what has been done with your life willingly

in the peach orchard in an old bathtub the children are standing someone in a bath of salt water and one gently attaches electrodes to the nipples of the one in the bath out of the weeds runs one with a rescued battery from the old motor home which they had gotten to rev its engine like the sad bleating of a goat if later anyone asks how they learned to do this in a striped shirt one will say oh i was looking for science experiments in those old textbooks someone got from the library book sale last year i have been baking all day and in a few minutes will start to wonder what happened to that box of coarse kosher salt i got just last week the children are all singing some ditty from a musical we saw at the community theater a few days ago and in the tub the one with electrodes affixed so gently to his chest is calling out little mews of uncertainty is calling and calling into the sundown past the knotted trees with their hairy fruits green and hard hush hush don ’ t worry another one is saying fingernail following a line of text in a complicated book i think this one is called the brazilian telephone one says connecting finally after all this build-up the ends of two wires to the battery terminals which with steel wool stolen from the kitchen they had cleaned so carefully earlier in the day
i cut myself upon the thought of you and yet i come back to it again and again a kind of fury makes me want to draw you out from the dimness of the present and set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses then going obviously to inhale their fragrance i touch the blade of you and cling upon it and only when the blood runs out across my fingers am i at all satisfied
whoever it was who brought the first wood and coal to start the fire did his part well not all wood takes to fire from a match nor coal from wood before it ’ s burned to charcoal the wood and coal in question caught a flame and flared up beautifully touching the air that takes a flame from anything somehow the fire was furnaced and then the time was ripe for some to say “ right banking of the furnace saves the coal. ” i ’ ve seen them set to work each in his way though all with shovels and with ashes never resting till the fire seemed most dead whereupon they ’ d crawl in hooded night-caps contentedly to bed sometimes the fire left alone would die but like as not spiced tongues remaining by the hardest on till day would flicker up never strong to anyone who cared to rake for them but roaring fires never have been made that way i ’ d like to tell those folks that one grand flare transferred to memory tissues of the air is worth a like or for dull minds that turn in gold all money ever saved by banking coal

because my voice was not the right voice and could not be understood i stood before the mirror — a murky glassen word this mouth can ’ t shape right to this day — and was made to watch my teeth and lips being imprecise so this is why i come across a southron and not from yorkshire or sri lankan but i ’ ll complain no more about this clarified and potent tongue for when the moustached gent at us customs asked me in his hapless twang are you a terrorist my borrowed posh it sure abashed that poor colonial and it was of course what my child-face perceived or could not in the glass which made of me a scrutineer of sound a listener for and into every glitch in the aathma the script the avid void of english
i was waiting to try out one of my inventions from the flattop garage roof — parachutes this time — when i tasted a black cherry from the next yard wondering even at that age who had prior rights and what was constitutional so instead of jumping i wrote a brief brief called yaakov vs. the tree trunk where everyone laughed herself crazy at marlboro vs. madison or red stain vs. the state of new jersey so bless me you fools for aren ’ t you mortals and don ’ t you bend your body down over the water to taste the ice and who in your family even ever just thought of swallowing a goldfish from the bowl say picking up its slippery body bending your neck back and gulping it down even before they entered law school

it is the fish that bring them first cod in such numbers as to seem endless cod to fill the nets and bellies of hungry europeans with the tender white flesh cod it seems to them without end they fill the ships salting the fish down in barrels til the hull is full and head back home this wet cod-fishing goes on for years far out in the banks with only an occasional stop on land we dry our fish in the sun cure it in smoke-houses and sure enough the foreigners hear about it soon they need a land base to dry the cod which weighs less than when wet tastes better too it is these dreams of cod that first bring the french to land dreams of cod the gold of the sea that will fill their bellies and their pockets
“ the conquest is not sustainable ” —winona laduke thanks for bringing that to our attention she said the first time to my response to a history text about a famous painting of the battle of quebec that never mentioned the french and only mentioned indians twice once as nuisances once as the noble savage kneeling by the dying english general this was during the french and indian war i said soon thousands of french and indian people would be displaced sold into indentured servitude my own family among them there would be bounties on the heads of abenaki people in maine and the english would sow the fields of the mohawks with salt thanks for bringing that up she said the next book mentioned cannibals in the caribbean indians who believed the spanish were gods indians killing themselves indian women in love with spanish pricks indians whose names even when known were passed over in favor of the ones given them by the spanish stop writing about indians she told me you ’ re making everyone feel guilty but the next book was back in maine home territory the diary of a midwife right after that same french and indian war and she was using herbs not found in english herbals and wrote that a “ young squaw ” visited her over a period of three weeks but the famous historian said only that there may have been indians in the area while she wrote at length about white men dressing up as indians to protest against the rich stealing their lands stop writing about indians she told me again only louder as if i was hard of hearing you have to allow authors their subjects she said stop writing about what isn ’ t in the text which is just our entire history this week she said i ’ m really upset you ’ re telling the same story three times because there ’ s only one story about indians and we all know what it is so i asked her if there are an infinite number of stories about white people and she told me to stop being racist so i stayed away from class for a week because they were reading a book about a mystery in the everglades and i knew there had to be indians in that swamp and i didn ’ t want to have to write about indians again it was on to the next book written she said by a cherokee writer which leslie silko who is laguna will be interested to find out because the book was ceremony but that is a small mistake sort of like saying that dante is chinese so i overlooked it now she told me write about indians and i might have done that except she went on about indians putting on a mask of whiteness like white people put on black face and some of the students wrote it down in their notebooks and everyone started talking about minstrel shows then she wanted me to tell her if there is such a thing as an indian world view and i said well yes and no which i figured was safe since i would be at least half-right whichever answer she wanted but when i mentioned the european world view she said there isn ’ t any such thing which was quite a relief to me i hate to think there were a whole lot of people thinking in hierarchies and as if the earth is a dead object and animals and plants and some people not having spirit then she said i ’ d better stick to what i know that is indians which is what i was trying to do in the first place and that maybe european philosophy was too much for my primitive brain in spite of its being my undergraduate major and i pointed out that the oppressed always know more about the oppressor than vice versa so she just glared at me and told me that i look scandinavian which was a surprise to me and i wondered why i never was a prom queen since it was always the scandinavian girls who got that honor maybe they never noticed i was one of them exactly how much indian are you anyway she asked i told her i guessed i was pretty much indian i suppose she wondered why i wouldn ’ t accept that mask of whiteness she kept talking about as myself

1 we travel upon the ark in mud and rain our oars promises from god we live—and the rest of humanity dies we travel upon the waves fastening our lives to the ropes of corpses filling the skies but between heaven and us is an opening a porthole for a supplication `` why lord have you saved us alone from among all the people and creatures and where are you casting us now to your other land to our first home into the leaves of death into the wind of life in us in our arteries flows a fear of the sun we despair of the light we despair lord of a tomorrow in which to start life anew if only we were not that seedling of creation of earth and its generations if only we had remained simple clay or ember or something in between then we would not have to see this world its lord and its hell twice over '' 2 if time started anew and waters submerged the face of life and the earth convulsed and that god rushed to me beseeching `` noah save the living '' i would not concern myself with his request i would travel upon my ark removing clay and pebbles from the eyes of the dead i would open the depths of their being to the flood and whisper in their veins that we have returned from the wilderness that we have emerged from the cave that we have changed the sky of years that we sail without giving in to our fears— that we do not heed the word of that god our appointment is with death our shores are a familiar and pleasing despair a gelid sea of iron water that we ford to its very ends undeterred heedless of that god and his word longing for a different a new lord
“ dead people don ’ t like olives ” i told my partners in eighth grade dancing class who never listened as we fox-trotted one-two one-two the dead people i often consulted nodded their skulls in unison while i flung my black velvet cape over my shoulders and glowered from deep-set burning eyes walking the city streets alone at fifteen crazy for cheerleaders and poems at hamden high football games girls in short pleated skirts pranced and kicked and i longed for their memorable thighs they were friendly—poets were mascots— but never listened when i told them that dead people didn ’ t like olives instead the poet wearing his cape continued to prowl in solitude intoning inscrutable stanzas as halfbacks and tackles made out friday nights after football on sofas in dark-walled rec rooms with magnanimous cheerleaders but decades later when the dead have stopped blathering about olives obese halfbacks wheeze upstairs to sleep beside cheerleaders waiting for hip replacements while a lascivious doddering poet his burning eyes deep-set in wrinkles cavorts with their daughters

at the farmer ’ s market in rosarito mexico a man touched my arm he sat on a stool at a wooden table and in the center a blue pitcher of water beaded under the sun hunkered over his lap he worked with a gouge on a block of walnut and he blew at the dust and the dust swirled in the breeze done stripping the sapwood vulnerable to rot the man held the heart of the wood a purple wood hard against the chisel ’ s cutting edge he looked up from his work and his gray eyes told me i must listen “ this wood must be strong or the heart cracks before the real work is done see this ” he asked softly and he lifted a mallet carved from a branch of apple “ strong wood ” he said “ it wanted to be more than a tree. ” he rubbed fresh walnut dust between his palms we drank glasses of ice water talked about life in general and he used the pitcher billowed and wet like the sail of a boat to cool his neck later through the soft meat of an avocado i felt the pit longing to be free

my red pickup choked on burnt oil as i drove down highway 99. in wind-tattered garbage bags i had packed my whole life two pairs of jeans a few t-shirts an a pair of work boots my truck needed work and through the blue smoke rising from under the hood i saw almond orchards plums and raisins spread out on paper trays and acres of mendota cotton my mother picked as a child my mother crawled through the furrows and plucked cotton balls that filled the burlap sack she dragged shoulder-slung through dried-up bolls husks weevils dirt clods and dust that filled the air with thirst but when she grew tired she slept on her mother ’ s burlap stuffed thick as a mattress and grandma dragged her over the land where time was told by the setting sun history cried out to me from the earth in the scream of starling flight and pounded at the hulls of seeds to be set free history licked the asphalt with rubber sighed in the windows of abandoned barns slumped in the wind-blasted palms groaned in the heat and whispered its soft curses i wanted my own history—not the earth ’ s nor the history of blood nor of memory and not the job founded for me at galdini sausage i sought my own—a new bruise to throb hard as the asphalt that pounded the chassis of my truck
at five o ’ clock in the morning i walked to work and passed the green ponds of horizon park where the last bluegill caught on the low slight bank panted hard in the dark mud crushed glass sour bottle caps whiskey and the iron weight of heat and smog this haze stared through eyes gray as the broken window panes on the cheap side of town and when this haze held you and whispered in your ears its quiet tragedies it stole your breath quick as time this is where men gathered to sell peanuts buckets of oranges and roses and they sat on the benches and watched the trucks drive by and disappear what i want to say is simple a man must do more than sell roses where the bums go and beg— he must keep something holy he must breath the winds that rustle the orchards of the valley where the white almond blooms replenish with their soft scent he must learn from the appaloosa when she walks in from the fields and bows her head to a trough of water that reflects nothing but her eyes and the stars shoulder fat bone and loose sheet metal banged out a day-long cacophony twenty-eight pounds of spice had to be mixed before the grinder was done mustard powder paprika salt and chili powder boiled in my nose in my eyes and in the red throb of my hard nicked-up knuckles by late morning the meat defrosted and the boxes began their ooze pig parts became easy to recognize eighty pounds of guts kidneys and stomach fell across my chest each time a box ripped apart we dared not stop the music of our work the clack of a clean pine pallet pink meat and white fat ground to a pulp sweetened stuffed and crimped the chorizo boxed the boxes labeled stacked and wrapped at lunch i watched guillermo hunker over the table and dig into his stew—carrots potatoes celery oxtail and gravy made from chili peppers and fat smoldering in a ceramic bowl guillermo took out a white cotton napkin and spread it evenly across his lap picked up a piece of sourdough ripped from a loaf and soaked the bread in the stew for a long time his own tired body taking back what the work took and he ate he sucked on chili peppers the color of blood and took another bite of the bread he sucked out the beef from the eyes of the bones and gnawed on the soft marrow and he drank hot coffee sweetened con canela “ eloisa ” he said “ can cook ” and he touched the brown lace crocheted into the edge of his cotton napkin rubbed his gut wiped the table and walked out to complete his work
we wondered what our walk should mean taking that un-march quietly the sun stared at our signs— “ thou shalt not kill. ” men by a tavern said “ those foreigners ” to a woman with a fur who turned away— like an elevator going down their look at us along a curb their signs lined across a picket line stopped and stared the whole width of the street at ours “ unfair. ” above our heads the sound truck blared— by the park under the autumn trees— it said that love could fill the atmosphere occur slow the other fallout unseen on islands everywhere—fallout falling unheard we held our poster up to shade our eyes at the end we just walked away no one was there to tell us where to leave the signs
on the rough diamond the hand-cut field below the dog lot and barn we rehearsed the strict technique of bunting i watched from the infield the mound the backstop as your left hand climbed the bat your legs and shoulders squared toward the pitcher you could drop it like a seed down either base line i admired your style but not enough to take my eyes off the bank that served as our center-field fence years passed three leagues of organized ball no few lives i could homer into the left-field lot of carmichael motors and still you stressed the same technique the crouch and spring the lead arm absorbing just enough impact that whole tiresome pitch about basics never changing and i never learned what you were laying down like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap let this be the sign i ’ m getting a grip on the sacrifice
you wanted to be so hungry you would break into branches and have to choose between the starving month ’ s nineteenth twenty-first and twenty-third evenings the liturgy begins to echo itself and why does it matter if the ground-water is too scarce one can stretch nets into the air and harvest the fog hunger opens you to illiteracy thirst makes clear the starving pattern the thick night is so quiet the spinning spider pauses the angel stops whispering for a moment— the secret night could already be over you will have to listen very carefully— you are never going to know which night ’ s mouth is sacredly reciting and which night ’ s recitation is secretly mere wind—

some men who are at least fifty-five wake up in the night to touch their sex like patting the family dog on the head others rise to pace the square of their den as if called to guard duty still others peer back at me from their bedroom windows as if on lookout for some lost shipment to arrive from bitterroot montana i uncurl in bed listening for the 3 am train to whip through wayzata hugging the lake so close i imagine it could skip the hot rails and skid across the ancestral ice toward me an ice train come to ferry me home or away from my encircling command or back to some earlier time when i too was more fiercely racing the night my body clamorous thumping the windows rattling the length of me moon-drenched snow falling sparks raking my wheels one more town flown through

i have never been fishing on the susquehanna or on any river for that matter to be perfectly honest not in july or any month have i had the pleasure—if it is a pleasure— of fishing on the susquehanna i am more likely to be found in a quiet room like this one— a painting of a woman on the wall a bowl of tangerines on the table— trying to manufacture the sensation of fishing on the susquehanna there is little doubt that others have been fishing on the susquehanna rowing upstream in a wooden boat sliding the oars under the water then raising them to drip in the light but the nearest i have ever come to fishing on the susquehanna was one afternoon in a museum in philadelphia when i balanced a little egg of time in front of a painting in which that river curled around a bend under a blue cloud-ruffled sky dense trees along the banks and a fellow with a red bandanna sitting in a small green flat-bottom boat holding the thin whip of a pole that is something i am unlikely ever to do i remember saying to myself and the person next to me then i blinked and moved on to other american scenes of haystacks water whitening over rocks even one of a brown hare who seemed so wired with alertness i imagined him springing right out of the frame

lime coats the thick sheaf of paper crossed by thin parallel lines of a darker green they approximate the rippling surface of a river pregnant with water and smoothly traveling towards an orb of sea salt his pen is a black crow against a sunlit sky its ink is harsh blotting paper even with the neat economy of motion in how the ink is laid for a moment a golden spark glints from a cufflink struck by a sun ray meticulously the ink travels from point to point dipping then rising then dipping again until it is halted by one of the four walls of a square the paper mottles he lays the pen besides the projection of a likelihood as an ache begins between his shoulder blades as he rolls his head in a circle he considers the placement of a decimal point lastly he considers the definition of a percentage to be the probability of error instead of the probability of an answer ’ s relevance it seems a secretary with large hair is shuffling until he notices that it is only a tight skirt hampering her thighs he begins to feel the papers stacked on a crudenza curling their edges to protest being ignored a lock of hair falls in front of his eyeballs and he notices a white feather he immediately comprehends how long it has been since scissors tip-toed about his scalp bereft he looks at his desk and is astonished at how still his fingers lie atop a yellow pad—he would have sworn his fear would have left his empty palms quaking at how time is consistently ending he looks up to be surprised at midnight “ a done deal. ” his hands seek release and he wipes them against the pin-striped wool encasing his thighs a woman with a blurred face atop a blue silk shirt pops her head through the door he knows she is speaking but his gaze can not locate the source of the buzzing he feels a fleeting thought of inebriated bees how they might blunder with pollen gratuitously his gaze falls to the circle of diamonds on her left blue-veined wrist he takes a chance and replies “ yes. ” it is sufficient to make her go away so that all that remains across his threshold is the shadow of a door he feels he must complete the job by shutting a door but he is so tired was i ever a boy he asks himself as he watches the chairman hold hands with his tall wife the wife smiles but it is clear she is dangling her legs over a pedestal when he reaches them for an obligatory greeting he realizes without being surprised at the certainty of this thought that she smells expensive he hears her emerald earrings tinkle like wind chimes his breath is the breeze against her pale seamless skin she smiles at him and he feels even smaller his breath is the flutter of a trochilidae ’ s wings when he next turns to the chairman he is buffeted by the chairman ’ s smug grin he tattoos his fingerprints on the most random of surfaces it happens that way each morning when he must read six newspapers beside the wall street journal one is in japanese another in german he can not recall the last time he was lucid he cuts himself shaving whenever the mirror reminds him that his eyes are covered by red cracks they remind him of bigger faultlines just waiting to widen he knows he will fold into himself during the fall he feels that avoidance should be under his control but it is not happening and he is often immobilized by this failure i should fall in love he thinks as he reads a worn newspaper clipping it has traveled throughout the firm and reached him at last he flinches at the leers clinging to the message his fingers feel wet though the clipping is dry the clipping is about alan “ swift ” thiessen the man who once sat in an office down the hall once swift was a tight muscle tightly sheathed in italian suits with double-breasted blazers a sartorial sun amidst the human commodities forging together a partnership it was an eccentricity allowed by swift ’ s ability to bleed rain from desiccated clients once swift also played squash every day now swift is clad in rough cotton and measures each passing moment in a jail staring at rust and bricks the newspaper reports how swift went too far with a young blonde boy sheathed in leather with metal studs still the investment banker suggests to himself that he fall in love despite swift ’ s ignominious end he feels that swift still bested him by having felt certain compulsions about which he can only remain curious at 4 a.m. he is not displeased to be alone walking the streets at 4 a.m. he feels that the hour offers a certain excuse for his loneliness now he is walking in the aftermath of an unseasonal rain so that the light is clean and the pavement shines from the wash of water the tall buildings conspire to maintain sufficient lights to surround him like christmas he notices a white flower in a bud vase by a window he passes it is unexpected but pleasing and he pauses to think hello he knows he is imagining things but he senses the flower open its petals a tad wider his nostrils flare at the inexplicable perfume of jasmine he looks forward to winter when snow will cover the city even in a blizzard the snow is constant they never fail to cling softly to him as he walks in their midst he feels it is such a loving feeling

the man i pulled tonight carried a load of books when i felt him watching me uphill i grimaced he gave me lunar cakes the size of two camel humps when i answered him i smiled to his face he wore the moonlight in his specs pant seams clean as the embroidery work of his book covers one can not grow rich without a bit of cleverness should i have shown him the secret of my deft touch the circling moon the graceful swan how east wind beats west wind if other two winds say so snow falls on cedars
the swinger the swirler the swirled stop grieving i drink all night but in a diminishing appetite the scene outside is obscene from a humbling window my sentiment spreads my famine a flagpole a grizzle birds sing next year ’ s songs or antique rescues i write but where shall i send it let go — i shall go tie the flowers the leaves the whole orchard the outskirts are curved shadows of countrywoman donors ... you bring me a cup of fresh tea that i love i return you two kapok leaves — like hand waves translated from the chinese
when i have baked white cakes and grated green almonds to spread upon them when i have picked the green crowns from the strawberries and piled them cone-pointed in a blue and yellow platter when i have smoothed the seam of the linen i have been working what then to-morrow it will be the same cakes and strawberries and needles in and out of cloth if the sun is beautiful on bricks and pewter how much more beautiful is the moon slanting down the gauffered branches of a plum-tree the moon wavering across a bed of tulips the moon still upon your face you shine beloved you and the moon but which is the reflection the clock is striking eleven i think when we have shut and barred the door the night will be dark outside
bath the day is fresh-washed and fair and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air the sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white it cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel and cracks it to bright light little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance dance and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling a stir of my finger sets them whirring reeling i move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar i lie back and laugh and let the green-white water the sun-flawed beryl water flow over me the day is almost too bright to bear the green water covers me from the too bright day i will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots the sky is blue and high a crow flaps by the window and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air breakfast table in the fresh-washed sunlight the breakfast table is decked and white it offers itself in flat surrender tendering tastes and smells and colours and metals and grains and the white cloth falls over its side draped and wide wheels of white glitter in the silver coffee-pot hot and spinning like catherine-wheels they whirl and twirl—and my eyes begin to smart the little white dazzling wheels prick them like darts placid and peaceful the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask a stack of butter-pats pyramidal shout orange through the white scream flutter call “ yellow yellow yellow ” coffee steam rises in a stream clouds the silver tea-service with mist and twists up into the sunlight revolved involuted suspiring higher and higher fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky a crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam the day is new and fair with good smells in the air walk over the street the white clouds meet and sheer away without touching on the sidewalks boys are playing marbles glass marbles with amber and blue hearts roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise the boys strike them with black and red striped agates the glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water i smell tulips and narcissus in the air but there are no flowers anywhere only white dust whipping up the street and a girl with a gay spring hat and blowing skirts the dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat high-heeled patent leather shoes tap tap the little heels pat the pavement and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat a water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way it is green and gay with new paint and rumbles contentedly sprinkling clear water over the white dust clear zigzagging water which smells of tulips and narcissus the thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky whoop the clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time whoop and a man ’ s hat careers down the street in front of the white dust leaps into the branches of a tree veers away and trundles ahead of the wind jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green a motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air sharp-beaked irresistible shouting to the wind to make way a glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it and settles down the sky is quiet and high and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air midday and afternoon swirl of crowded streets shock and recoil of traffic the stock-still brick façade of an old church against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw flare of sunshine down side-streets eddies of light in the windows of chemists ’ shops with their blue gold purple jars darting colours far into the crowd loud bangs and tremors murmurings out of high windows whirring of machine belts blurring of horses and motors a quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky i am a piece of the town a bit of blown dust thrust along with the crowd proud to feel the pavement under me reeling with feet feet tripping skipping lagging dragging plodding doggedly or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps a boy is selling papers i smell them clean and new from the press they are fresh like the air and pungent as tulips and narcissus the blue sky pales to lemon and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows putting out their contents in a flood of flame night and sleep the day takes her ease in slippered yellow electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts following each other they grow and grow and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night twinkle jab snap that means a new play and over the way plop drop quiver is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker ’ s sign with its length on another street a gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building but the sky is high and has her own stars why should she heed ours i leave the city with speed wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness the breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean it has come but recently from the high sky there are no flowers in bloom yet but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus my room is tranquil and friendly out of the window i can see the distant city a band of twinkling gems little flower-heads with no stems i can not see the beer-glass nor the letters of the restaurants and shops i passed now the signs blur and all together make the city glowing on a night of fine weather like a garden stirring and blowing for the spring the night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air wrap me close sheets of lavender pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears the breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days and cobbled streets and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways pale blue lavender you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair i smell the stars they are like tulips and narcissus i smell them in the air
goaded and harassed in the factory that tears our life up into bits of days ticked off upon a clock which never stays shredding our portion of eternity we break away at last and steal the key which hides a world empty of hours ways of space unroll and heaven overlays the leafy sun-lit earth of fantasy beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun scorching against the blue flame of the sky brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine within a granite basin under one the bronze-gold glimmer of a carp and i reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine
aftear night ’ s thunder far away had rolled the fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold and in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled like the first gods before they made the world and misery swimming the stormless sea in beauty and in divine gaiety the smooth white empty road was lightly strewn with leaves—the holly ’ s autumn falls in june— and fir cones standing stiff up in the heat the mill-foot water tumbled white and lit with tossing crystals happier than any crowd of children pouring out of school aloud and in the little thickets where a sleeper for ever might lie lost the nettle-creeper and garden warbler sang unceasingly while over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee the swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow as if the bow had flown off with the arrow only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown travelled the road in the field sloping down park-like to where its willows showed the brook haymakers rested the tosser lay forsook out in the sun and the long waggon stood without its team it seemed it never would move from the shadow of that single yew the team as still until their task was due beside the labourers enjoyed the shade that three squat oaks mid-field together made upon a circle of grass and weed uncut and on the hollow once a chalk-pit but now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean the men leaned on their rakes about to begin but still and all were silent all was old this morning time with a great age untold older than clare and cobbett morland and crome than at the field ’ s far edge the farmer ’ s home a white house crouched at the foot of a great tree under the heavens that know not what years be the men the beasts the trees the implements uttered even what they will in times far hence— all of us gone out of the reach of change— immortal in a picture of an old grange
at hawthorn-time in wiltshire travelling in search of something chance would never bring an old man ’ s face by life and weather cut and coloured —rough brown sweet as any nut — a land face sea-blue-eyed —hung in my mind when i had left him many a mile behind all he said was “ nobody can ’ t stop ’ ee it ’ s a footpath right enough you see those bits of mounds—that ’ s where they opened up the barrows sixty years since while i was scaring sparrows they thought as there was something to find there but couldn ’ t find it by digging anywhere. ” to turn back then and seek him where was the use there were three manningfords —abbots bohun and bruce and whether alton not manningford it was my memory could not decide because there was both alton barnes and alton priors all had their churches graveyards farms and byres lurking to one side up the paths and lanes seldom well seen except by aeroplanes and when bells rang or pigs squealed or cocks crowed then only heard ages ago the road approached the people stood and looked and turned nor asked it to come nearer nor yet learned to move out there and dwell in all men ’ s dust and yet withal they shot the weathercock just because ’ twas he crowed out of tune they said so now the copper weathercock is dead if they had reaped their dandelions and sold them fairly they could have afforded gold many years passed and i went back again among those villages and looked for men who might have known my ancient he himself had long been dead or laid upon the shelf i thought one man i asked about him roared at my description “ ’ tis old bottlesford he means bill. ” but another said “ of course it was jack button up at the white horse he ’ s dead sir these three years. ” this lasted till a girl proposed walker of walker ’ s hill “ old adam walker adam 's point you ’ ll see marked on the maps. ” “ that was her roguery ” the next man said he was a squire ’ s son who loved wild bird and beast and dog and gun for killing them he had loved them from his birth one with another as he loved the earth “ the man may be like button or walker or like bottlesford that you want but far more he sounds like one i saw when i was a child i could almost swear to him the man was wild and wandered his home was where he was free everybody has met one such man as he does he keep clear old paths that no one uses but once a lifetime when he loves or muses he is english as this gate these flowers this mire and when at eight years old lob-lie-by-the-fire came in my books this was the man i saw he has been in england as long as dove and daw calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree the rose campion bridget-in-her-bravery and in a tender mood he as i guess christened one flower love-in-idleness and while he walked from exeter to leeds one april called all cuckoo-flowers milkmaids from him old herbal gerard learnt as a boy to name wild clematis the traveller ’ s-joy our blackbirds sang no english till his ear told him they called his jan toy ‘ pretty dear. ’ she was jan toy the lucky who having lost a shilling and found a penny loaf rejoiced for reasons of his own to him the wren is jenny pooter before all other men ’ twas he first called the hog ’ s back the hog ’ s back that mother dunch ’ s buttocks should not lack their name was his care he too could explain totteridge and totterdown and juggler ’ s lane he knows if anyone why tumbling bay inland in kent is called so he might say “ but little he says compared with what he does if ever a sage troubles him he will buzz like a beehive to conclude the tedious fray and the sage who knows all languages runs away yet lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool and though he never could spare time for school to unteach what the fox so well expressed on biting the cock ’ s head off —quietness is best — he can talk quite as well as anyone after his thinking is forgot and done he first of all told someone else ’ s wife for a farthing she ’ d skin a flint and spoil a knife worth sixpence skinning it she heard him speak ‘ she had a face as long as a wet week ’ said he telling the tale in after years with blue smock and with gold rings in his ears sometimes he is a pedlar not too poor to keep his wit this is tall tom that bore the logs in and with shakespeare in the hall once talked when icicles hung by the wall as herne the hunter he has known hard times on sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes which others spoilt and hob being then his name he kept the hog that thought the butcher came to bring his breakfast ‘ you thought wrong ’ said hob when there were kings in kent this very lob whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry wedded the king ’ s daughter of canterbury for he alone unlike squire lord and king watched a night by her without slumbering he kept both waking when he was but a lad he won a rich man ’ s heiress deaf dumb and sad by rousing her to laugh at him he carried his donkey on his back so they were married and while he was a little cobbler ’ s boy he tricked the giant coming to destroy shrewsbury by flood ‘ and how far is it yet ’ the giant asked in passing ‘ i forget but see these shoes i ‘ ve worn out on the road and we ’ re not there yet. ’ he emptied out his load of shoes for mending the giant let fall from his spade the earth for damming severn and thus made the wrekin hill and little ercall hill rose where the giant scraped his boots while still so young our jack was chief of gotham ’ s sages but long before he could have been wise ages earlier than this while he grew thick and strong and ate his bacon or at times sang a song and merely smelt it as jack the giant-killer he made a name he too ground up the miller the yorkshireman who ground men ’ s bones for flour “ do you believe jack dead before his hour or that his name is walker or bottlesford or button a mere clown or squire or lord the man you saw —lob-lie-by-the-fire jack cade jack smith jack moon poor jack of every trade young jack or old jack or jack what-d ’ ye-call jack-in-the-hedge or robin-run-by-the-wall robin hood ragged robin lazy bob one of the lords of no man ’ s land good lob — although he was seen dying at waterloo hastings agincourt and sedgemoor too — lives yet he never will admit he is dead till millers cease to grind men ’ s bones for bread not till our weathercock crows once again and i remove my house out of the lane on to the road. ” with this he disappeared in hazel and thorn tangled with old-man ’ s-beard but one glimpse of his back as there he stood choosing his way proved him of old jack ’ s blood young jack perhaps and now a wiltshireman as he has oft been since his days began
the forest ended glad i was to feel the light and hear the hum of bees and smell the drying grass and the sweet mint because i had come to an end of forest and because here was both road and inn the sum of what ’ s not forest but ’ twas here they asked me if i did not pass yesterday this way “ not you queer. ” “ who then and slept here ” i felt fear i learnt his road and ere they were sure i was i left the dark wood behind kestrel and woodpecker the inn in the sun the happy mood when first i tasted sunlight there i travelled fast in hopes i should outrun that other what to do when caught i planned not i pursued to prove the likeness and if true to watch until myself i knew i tried the inns that evening of a long gabled high-street grey of courts and outskirts travelling an eager but a weary way in vain he was not there nothing told me that ever till that day had one like me entered those doors save once that time i dared “ you may recall ” —but never-foamless shores make better friends than those dull boors many and many a day like this aimed at the unseen moving goal and nothing found but remedies for all desire these made not whole they sowed a new desire to kiss desire ’ s self beyond control desire of desire and yet life stayed on within my soul one night in sheltering from the wet i quite forgot i could forget a customer then the landlady stared at me with a kind of smile they hesitated awkwardly their silence gave me time for guile had anyone called there like me i asked it was quite plain the wile succeeded for they poured out all and that was naught less than a mile beyond the inn i could recall he was like me in general he had pleased them but i less i was more eager than before to find him out and to confess to bore him and to let him bore i could not wait children might guess i had a purpose something more that made an answer indiscreet one girl ’ s caution made me sore too indignant even to greet that other had we chanced to meet i sought then in solitude the wind had fallen with the night as still the roads lay as the ploughland rude dark and naked on the hill had there been ever any feud ’ twixt earth and sky a mighty will closed it the crocketed dark trees a dark house dark impossible cloud-towers one star one lamp one peace held on an everlasting lease and all was earth ’ s or all was sky ’ s no difference endured between the two a dog barked on a hidden rise a marshbird whistled high unseen the latest waking blackbird ’ s cries perished upon the silence keen the last light filled a narrow firth among the clouds i stood serene and with a solemn quiet mirth an old inhabitant of earth once the name i gave to hours like this was melancholy when it was not happiness and powers coming like exiles home again and weaknesses quitting their bowers smiled and enjoyed far off from men moments of everlastingness and fortunate my search was then while what i sought nevertheless that i was seeking i did not guess that time was brief once more at inn and upon road i sought my man till once amid a tap-room ’ s din loudly he asked for me began to speak as if it had been a sin of how i thought and dreamed and ran after him thus day after day he lived as one under a ban for this what had i got to say i said nothing i slipped away and now i dare not follow after too close i try to keep in sight dreading his frown and worse his laughter i steal out of the wood to light i see the swift shoot from the rafter by the inn door ere i alight i wait and hear the starlings wheeze and nibble like ducks i wait his flight he goes i follow no release until he ceases then i also shall cease
the dim sea glints chill the white sun is shy and the skeleton weeds and the never-dry rough long grasses keep white with frost at the hilltop by the finger-post the smoke of the traveller ’ s-joy is puffed over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft i read the sign which way shall i go a voice says you would not have doubted so at twenty another voice gentle with scorn says at twenty you wished you had never been born one hazel lost a leaf of gold from a tuft at the tip when the first voice told the other he wished to know what ’ twould be to be sixty by this same post “ you shall see ” he laughed—and i had to join his laughter— “ you shall see but either before or after whatever happens it must befall a mouthful of earth to remedy all regrets and wishes shall freely be given and if there be a flaw in that heaven ’ twill be freedom to wish and your wish may be to be here or anywhere talking to me no matter what the weather on earth at any age between death and birth to see what day or night can be the sun and the frost the land and the sea summer autumn winter spring — with a poor man of any sort down to a king standing upright out in the air wondering where he shall journey o where ”
downhill i came hungry and yet not starved cold yet had heat within me that was proof against the north wind tired yet so that rest had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof then at the inn i had food fire and rest knowing how hungry cold and tired was i. all of the night was quite barred out except an owl ’ s cry a most melancholy cry shaken out long and clear upon the hill no merry note nor cause of merriment but one telling me plain what i escaped and others could not that night as in i went and salted was my food and my repose salted and sobered too by the bird ’ s voice speaking for all who lay under the stars soldiers and poor unable to rejoice

after raymond carver ’ s hummingbird suppose i said the word “ springtime ” and i wrote the words “ king salmon ” on a piece of paper and mailed it to you when you opened it would you remember that afternoon we spent together in the yellow boat when the early whales were feeding and we caught our first fish of the year or would you remember that time off cape flattery when you were a little girl your father smoking telling stories as he ran the boat then the tug and zing of that very first fish spooling off into the gray-green world you laughing and brushing back your hair before setting the hook i know i am hard to understand sometimes particularly when you are standing at the post office with only a piece of paper saying “ king salmon ” on it but just think of it as a promissary note and that electric tug that thrill pulling your mind into deep water is how i feel about you every single day
the seats faced backwards although the train car was headed forward the engineers designed it that way intentionally the cushioned seats at the front facing in toward the rest of the car —passengers ’ faces a japanese flower arrangement of faces the platform began receding whoosh not in the sense of being unconscious or knocked out but i was coming to see that is to understand an endurance test deep inside that things could have gone differently the furniture it could have turned out completely different that ’ s within the realm of possibilities as if the election were in our favor somewhere else in the united states of atlantis.— i left off just as i was going to make a mental note in that regard that we were carried along passively in motion without walking or running spastic reflex in the legs —to sit down in one city stay seated an hour and a half and then stand up in a small town milton bradley must have modeled its tiny green monopoly houses and red hotels after

some years ago a procession of men calling themselves the sky-clad came to this district to build a hospital for birds that had been damaged by the rains the landholders here my grandfather among them decided against it— it not being our way to intervene with monsoons which is why to this day the birds here grow so damaged wise or so our tutor said gravely before stepping out into the sun- washed coriander patch to watch droplets work down stems one by one small storms suspended while over the rooftiles came breakers of mist making our whole house to him drift back like the high prow of the viceroy ’ s steamship he watched sail off with his youth inside i still could not find the main verb the chariot wheel performed i thought it was silver it bore the king with 100 heads across a battlefield red with his wounded up to the end of the beginner ’ s workbook then blue-skinned rama bent his bow then his raider ’ s arrow met the axle then i could not stop laughing as through the doorway my mother scolded the aphasic houseboy who peed into our green watertank black putti untouchable arcing the thin golden stream singing ooo-ee ooo-ee at our ruin
she minces squid and a marinated scallion mixes rice with shrimp and olive paste hope for the english meal though half italian with her jet black hair and her elastic waist unlike the other television cooks she brings to life a lobster that was dead with common spices her exotic looks and recipes she dreamed about in bed
a current like a noise machine through sleep blue lichen fields mossed boulders waking up to ice cubes cracking in a plastic cup and voices “ awesome for the hong kong branch well most of all we miss our daughter ” i still see it the climb up slate as runnels spill from some bare misted summit like a source whatever sense this dream might make to others and whatever when they wake they also have been dreaming rivers of faces down hallways merging as desires mesh and fissure cash for clothes or arms or flesh and if there is no towering sublime where all comes clear to all no final climb through cloud like some old bible illustration how could that ever stop the current flowing out of the glass at jfk skin glowing plumb and peach as we walk inside the sun
as usual the first gate was modest it is dilapidated she can ’ t tell which bridge crossed the moat which all cross sand now disordered with footsteps it ’ s a precise overlay of circles on squares but she has trouble locating the main avenue and retraces her steps in intense heat for the correct entrance which was intentionally blurred the way a round arch can give onto a red wall far enough in back of the arch for sun to light if being by yourself separates from your symmetry which is the axis of your spine in the concrete sense but becomes a suspension in your spine like a layer of sand under the paving stones of a courtyard or on a plain you have to humbly seek out a person who can listen to you on a street crowded with bicycles at night their bells ringing and any stick or straight line you hold can be your spine like a map she is following in french of tan tien she wants space to fall to each side of her like traction not weight dispersed within a mirror at any time an echo of what she says will multiply against the walls in balanced dizzying jumps like a gyroscope in the heat but she is alone later she would remember herself as a carved figure and its shadow on a blank board but she is her balancing stick and the ground to each side of her is its length disordered once by an armored car and once by an urn of flowers at a crossing the stick isn ’ t really the temple ’ s bisection around her like solstice or ancestor this tang dynasty peach tree would be parallel levitation in the spine the person recording it slowly the hall looms up the red stair ’ s outline gives way to its duration as it extends and rises at a low angle in comparison to the family the individual hardly counts but they all wait for her at a teahouse inside the wall first the gold knob then blue tiers above the highest step the same color as the sky when one person came to gain confidence she imagines he felt symmetry as flight after his fast among seven meteorites in the dark he really felt like a globe revolving within a globe even the most singular or indivisible particle or heavenly sphere will adjust when the axis extending beyond itself is pushed or the sphere it is within is pushed what she thought was her balance flattens into a stylized dragon on the marble paving stones yet she ’ s reluctant to leave the compound only the emperor could walk its center line now anyone can imagine how it felt to bring heaven news she is trying to remember this in hong kong as the tram pulls suddenly above skyscrapers and the harbor and she flattens against her seat like a reversal occurring in the poles or what she meant by no one can imagine how

often rebuked yet always back returning to those first feelings that were born with me and leaving busy chase of wealth and learning for idle dreams of things which can not be to-day i will seek not the shadowy region its unsustaining vastness waxes drear and visions rising legion after legion bring the unreal world too strangely near i ’ ll walk but not in old heroic traces and not in paths of high morality and not among the half-distinguished faces the clouded forms of long-past history i ’ ll walk where my own nature would be leading it vexes me to choose another guide where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding where the wild wind blows on the mountain side what have those lonely mountains worth revealing more glory and more grief than i can tell the earth that wakes one human heart to feeling can centre both the worlds of heaven and hell

the trouble was not about finding acceptance acceptance was available in the depths of the mind and among like people the trouble was the look into the canyon which had come a long time earlier and spent many years being forgotten the fine garments and rows of strong shoes the pantry stocked with good grains and butter— everything could be earned by producing right answers answers were important the canyon said but the answers were not the solution a glimpse into the future had shown the prairie on which houses stood sturdily the earth was moist and generous the sunlight benevolent the homesteaders dreamed up palaces and descendants and the animals slept soundly as stones it was a hard-earned heaven the self-making of travelers and often out on the plains mirages rose of waterfalls moose and rows of fresh-plowed soil but nobody stopped to drink the false water real water being plentiful they were not thirsty a few made their fortunes from native beauty others from native strength but most from knowledge as uncertainties in science could be written off to faith faith was religious and ordinary life physical and spiritual was a song that had not yet arrived
i never had to make one no sickening weeks by ocean no waiting for the aerogrammes that gradually ceased to come spent the babysitting money on novels shoes and movies yet the neighborhood stayed empty it had nothing to do with a journey not undertaken not with dialect nor with a land that waited to be rediscovered then rejected as acid rain collected above the suburban hills i tried to imagine being nothing tried to be able to claim “ i have no culture ” and be believed yet the land occupies the person even as the semblance of freedom invites a kind of recklessness tradition unobserved unasked hangs on tight ancestors roam into reverie interfering at the most awkward moments first flirtations in doorways and dressing rooms— but of course here in america no one escapes in the end each traveler returns to the town where everyone knew she hadn ’ t even been born

and now the silver ripping sound of white on white the satin light snow torn under wheels car bang metally grenading and the wood poles whipping loom— ¤ i have always wanted to sing a song of praise for the unscathed myself stepping from the fractured car whose black axle ’ s one inch from gone slim pole slicing cable up to sheet metal seat foam corduroy like butter the mechanic will later tell me poking a stiff finger through the cloth to pierce the exact point i was supposed to sit stopping because praise begins where pain transfigures itself stoppered by a deeper kind of joy so i transfigure myself from driver to survivor the blessed lazarine failure bolting up and opening her eyes and here are the thousand wrecks from a life configured in snow before me myself at five pulled from the burning car seat at twelve bleeding from the scalp after the car throws me from my bike at fourteen tumbling over the slick hood rushing sockets of windows with glass bashed out into a translucent toothy ring lights and bumpers clipped clean off tires burst deer gravitationally hurled through my windshield brakes given out and worse the icy loop de loops on roads the trucker ’ s 18 fat wheels squealing— all the ways technology should have killed me and didn ’ t praise for my death-hungry luck and all the manner in which i ’ ve failed it— marriage lost buried in the blanks of white space my solitude at the greyhound station knowing no one to retrieve me carless among the other pressed tight to their own disaster or boredom— unbearably young mothers drifters boy soldiers shoulder to shoulder with the insane weaving the same thread of conversation back and forth between ourselves how could this happen to me at this age at this stage how did i not notice and will you put this seat up and will you lend me this quarter and will you call me a cab when we get back home the young man in the seat before me head full of zigzagging tight braids says sure you can dig up that ballot box in florida and while you ’ re at it look up all the bones buried in the everglades repeats it for the amusement of the woman across from him who knows a presidential failure like she knows herself and when we pass my accident on the road points and whistles snickers bet you no one walked away from that one for this and for all these things praise to the white plains of wyoming highway coiled like a length of rime-colored rope to snow broiling in the sunlight so that the landscape takes on a nuclear glow so bright we have to shield our eyes from it praise for myself playing at morbidity because i thought i had a right to it as if flesh had to follow spirit to such a pure depth the bones themselves could not rest but must be broken nerves singed then ripped out the heart clenched madly in its chest as if i had nothing except this white earth this smashed car to praise what i knew before and know even better now the hills cold as a hip bone and tufted with ice praise to my youth and to my age praise to ambition and small-mindedness the kind i recognize and the kind i am soon to recognize praise to self-hatred for it keeps me alive and praise for the splinters of delight that can pierce it praise for wood pole praise for glass praise for muscle praise for bone the sky is bright as a bowl on a nurse ’ s table today and the sun gleams into it as our bus slides by the light of us a wash of gold illuminating bodies lost bodies regained gleaming like my heart here on this earth bloody and still beating

we stopped at a farmer ’ s house before parking at the dock that creaked over the river rowboats for rent five bucks an hour twenty for the day deep water i knew a canvas bag was in the trunk i knew lunch would be roast beef sandwiches and hot stew from a thermos chunks of carrot and potatoes cut by my mother who slept through the racket of our leaving while my father paid i loaded the boat with our poles and tackle boxes lead sinkers shaped like grey pears raincoats and a case of beer i was ten and i knew my dad would toss that canvas bag into the aluminum boat with a thunk we fish for gar with kittens he ’ d yelled last night at my mother and that was that the rowboat slid from the dock the occasional clunk of the first six-pack clipped on the fish stringer and i knew that i should take my time fastening the wire leader to the brass swivel tying on those massive sinkers i knew that the six-inch treble hook would tremble in my hands and when i was done i knew what came next a canvas bag stiff kittens blood i tore two hooks through the side of a calico yanked upward with a sharp tug to lodge the third barb beneath the ribs i dangled my fingers in cold water to wash them then reared the rod back into a cast that splashed twenty feet from the boat he popped the third beer and finished baiting his hook too deep for an anchor we drifted and far beneath the gar cruised back and forth their prehistoric snouts slicing the dark bumping our bait again and again until that fierce hunger i was learning said clamp down and take it

sometimes we blubbered through the fallout of willful confusion in pants that didn ’ t fit the legs we sawed off we looked at each other and fell forward and back forward and back a little bit like dancing and a little like aggravated assault at times it seemed reasonable because it always seems reasonable to accept whatever anxieties or losses must accumulate in the face of what we really wanted all along in buildings and on streets you could paint a few eyes on a face and see the careless representation of brothers and sisters making a family out of paint and the gracious mistakes of seeing mistakes the essence of sight could have been all we had to go on anyway and not for us to leave behind what took us through the shower of dumbasses with tact and a breath of elegance even the hope that later when the streets cleared of agitated needlers and the ac kicked on for good we could sleep on the clothes spangled outside the closet and find a reason for closing the bedroom door on shadows of pedantic radiation from thin margins of lamplight always suggesting some other plot in some other bedroom tensions to splay us soon enough and then it occurred to you or maybe it occurred to me doesn ’ t matter i think actually someone called and said that anyone who doesn ’ t leave something for you isn ’ t worth having so maybe now 's a good time to find a dapper little high school where everyone can be a little less civil and blessed with selfishness we could part the fingers interlocked between us make fists and get busy then intensity fermented into green books of music loud country music and i love country music it rolled around my ears in corridors where boredom had once been so irrefutable and heavy and i was happy and dancing and throwing punches at pigeons and even hitting a few but the romantic arc never made it over the willful lack of conviction some gap between the faces on the heads we saw pass our table in the sour-faced restaurant run by those french people okay a gap between that and the face in the dream you had of your father the one where you said he stuffed a billy club down a duck ’ s throat and called for another shot of dewar ’ s i expected you to take things when you left but not those things light diffuses evenly across the kitchen blood through my body and it ’ s sort of funny but our whole thing fits between two haircuts like a roadtrip or something i feel now that i ’ ve been digested by time and light would pool into terrible reflections of my own back as i backed into a mirror or performed some other forgetful jujitsu an effort to lose thoughts or patterns of thought but the light diffuses and you walk through it collide with little pieces of what ate you get angry and write long letters about how your hand can ’ t talk how the paper is so light and effortless when you hold it how could you even know you couldn ’ t even imagine holding this light and ridiculous thing that my hand brushed over in patterns it will later try to forget then i taped my mouth shut and tried to whistle leave me alone don ’ t call get lost dumpster of confusion i know it ’ s never been that easy that from the eyes in your skull the black plastic bags were suffocating the trees even though to me it was more like a ballerina ’ s shadow had escaped and was dancing through the branches frantically with desperate happiness and cause for alarm i guess either way something unsafe and ridiculous was happening and i guess we knew it i think we even talked about it but i ’ ve been a little lonely since i started writing my dissertation it ’ s about class consciousness among people who work behind registers and it ’ s interesting there ’ s all kinds of different races and classes and income levels represented in the world of cashiers but at the level of values we see predominantly two classes the complacent and the entitled though many cashiers are some measure of both the complacent are resigned to what they understand to be their position they ’ re courteous and reliable class issues only arise when people are rude to them which they tend to handle fine though if they say anything about it afterwards it tends to be a cruel and brief dismissal not only of the occurrence but of the entire offending person the entitled have a very complicated expression of social hierarchy because they see themselves in transition usually ascending there ’ s this idea that their values won ’ t or can ’ t find full expression from their current position and so they don ’ t feel compelled to act in a way consistent with their values while at the same time they may expect to be treated in accordance with those values when people are rude to them they flip out basically today ’ s been pasted together from the leavings of some green intensity and cigarettes crowded at the back of the passive classrooms of the skull will there be coffee on the other side will there be ladies to walk up to you on a plain old shit-for-brains day and ask you of washington square park “ why is this on the map ” i like it when people cock their heads a little when you talk seems elegant i tell them i ’ m not sure but henry james wrote something complicated about it then these nice ladies with a telling lack of accent move along into non-history and the bulk of our hours waiting without a mind for restitution i would surrender our moist telephone calls and arthritic tribes of entitlement if i knew who to give them up to i never go anywhere or do anything slow because revision is only a function of doubt well okay maybe doubt and shame actually it ’ s just shame revision is a function of shame but enough of these dead people we must rise like blood in april instead here i am peeling seconds off the end of my life glass of water frown on face notebook open to the parade of minutes and obvious as a daisycutter in the desert no more nights in the kitchen or bowls of macaroni no more misdemeanors with the microwave or blue orbs whistling into my ear no more cats meowing at the television no cigarettes on the patio no more blessings in drag my schedule is totally blank this afternoon
i was ready for a new experience all the old ones had burned out they lay in little ashy heaps along the roadside and blew in drifts across the fairgrounds and fields from a distance some appeared to be smoldering but when i approached with my hat in my hands they let out small puffs of smoke and expired through the windows of houses i saw lives lit up with the otherworldly glow of tv and these were smoking a little bit too i flew to rome i flew to greece i sat on a rock in the shade of the acropolis and conjured dusky columns in the clouds i watched waves lap the crumbling coast i heard wind strip the woods i saw the last living snow leopard pacing in the dirt experience taught me that nothing worth doing is worth doing for the sake of experience alone i bit into an apple that tasted sweetly of time the sun came out it was the old sun with only a few billion years left to shine

sometimes it takes miles to give up resistance though the mirror shows a body unresisting shows perhaps something to admire others may a body without difficulty loosening breaking its own willfulness cracking itself like a rusted bolt that finally begins to turn a body that turns toward openness fantasy those desires of and not of the body sometimes i notice a powerful man engaged steadily repeating difficult action folding himself his tight skin over and over lifting a declined torso or pulling up a suspended trunk and think how neat how controlled to be inside that body i struggle not to stare grip myself not to lose myself inside the thought of being inside that body i can never get there i know because it is the image i want the veneer of muscle having taken primacy from mind now first among equals bicep abdominal quadricep the launch after launch of a perpetual run i want the image even when i am it or nearly it— because even then i am also that other thing self-conscious burdened struggling for movement if there is a link between god and animals— the way he identifies with the so much that isn ’ t us as he had to have to have made them— it must be in the body enacting will immediate through movement as if with a word creating a world enacting creation immediate through speech which is to say this is my time of prayer my only time miles in as long as it takes for the body to relinquish resistance bright public surrounded by others who move toward better movement and all the while seeing in a wall of mirrors that image of myself deer horse running close kin to breathing motion necessary to survival perfect image of a man that i ’ m merely a self-conscious copy of i pray for things of course for myself and for those whose pain touches me selfish and unselfish prayers for intimates and strangers i pray for the runner in the mirror too sleek easy animal unselfconscious and present and absent as a god the man who could almost be me who i do my best to rush toward i pray that one day by his grace we may meet
for my mother yoshiko horikoshi roripaugh 1. x-ray my mother carried the chest x-ray in her lap on the plane inside a manila envelope that read do not bend and garnished with leis at the honolulu airport waited in line—this strange image of ribcage chain-link vertebrae pearled milk of lung and the murky enigmatic chambers of her heart in hand until it was her turn and the immigration officer held the black-and-white film up to sun light pierced clean through her and she was ushered from one life through the gate of another wreathed in the dubious and illusory perfume of plucked orchids 2. ceramic pig newly arrived in new mexico stiff and crisp in new dungarees her honeymoon they drove into the mountains in a borrowed car spiraling up and up toward the rumor of deer into the green tangy turpentine scent of pine where air crackled with the sizzling collision of bees furred legs grappling velvet bodies as they mated midair and where they came upon the disconsolate gaze of a madonna alcoved against the side of the road her feet wreathed in candles fruit flowers and other offerings nearby a vendor with a wooden plank balanced between two folding chairs and the glossy row of ceramic pigs lined up across brilliant glaze shimmering the heat my mother fell in love with the red- and-blue splash of flowers tattooed into fat flanks and bellies the green arabesques of stem and leaf circling hoof snout and ear so exotic years later she still describes the pig with a sigh—heartbroken the word she chooses with careful consideration she ’ d filled the pig with kennedy dollars from the grocery budget each half dollar a small luxury denied at the local piggly wiggly until one day jingling the shift and clink of the pig ’ s growing silver weight she shook too hard and as if the hoarded wealth of her future were too much to contain the pig broke open—spilling coins like water a cold shiny music into her lap— fragments of bright pottery shards scattering delicate as easter eggshell 3. sneeze my mother sneezes in japanese ké-sho an exclamation of surprise—two sharp crisp syllables before pulling out the neatly folded and quartered tissue she keeps tucked inside the wrist of her sweater sleeve sometimes when ragweed blooms i wonder why her sneeze isn ’ t mine why something so involuntary so deeply rooted in the seed of speech breaks free from my mouth like thistle in a stiff breeze in a language other than my mother ’ s tongue how do you chart the diaspora of a sneeze i don ’ t know how you turned out this way she always tells me and i think that we are each her own moon—one face in shadow undisclosed seas and surprising mountains rotating in the circular music of separate spheres but held in orbit by the gravitational muscle of the same mercurial spinning heart 4. dalmatian there is an art to this to shish kebab the varnished pit of avocado on three toothpicks above a pickle jar of cool water tease down the pale thirsty hairs of root until one sinewy arm punches up and unclenches its green fisted hand palm open to the sun to discern the oniony star-struck subterfuge of bulbs their perverse desires death-like sleeps and conspire behind the scenes to embroider the elizabethan ruffles and festoons of their flamboyant resurrections to trick the tomatoes into letting down their swelling tumescent orbs in the cottony baked heat of the attic until their sunburnt faces glow like round orange lanterns under the crepuscular twilight of the eaves unwrapping the cuttings of succulents from their moist paper-towel bandages and snugging them down into firm dimples of dirt and peat coaxing up the apple-green serpentine coils of sweet pea with a snake charmer ’ s song to wind around the trellis and flicker their quick pink-petaled tongues the tender slips of mint sueded upturned bells of petunia and slim fingers of pine that pluck the metal window screen like a tin harp by the breakfast nook where my father stirs his morning coffee and waits for the neighbors ’ dalmatian to hurl itself over the back fence and hang limply twisting and gasping on the end of its chain and collar like a polka-dotted petticoat until my father goes outside and

fruit orchards during autumn when chestnuts dropped from their trees and struck the metal rooftop like the small heavy tongues of bells and black dragon- flies like quick shiny needles darted in and out of the spin and turn of leaves fluttering down like soft bright scraps of silk she wrapped the apple in a napkin to save for later and it was confiscated at customs before she had the chance for even a taste over the years it seemed to grow larger yellower juicier and more delicious and even though there were burnished rows of apples stacked in gleaming pyramids at the supermarket with quaint names like macintosh winesap and granny smith and even though there were sunlit apple orchards at my american grandfather ’ s ranch where rattlesnakes slumbered in the heat and redolence of fruit flesh frightening the horses she sampled one after another but they never tasted as sweet or as bright as the apple taken from her the one she had to leave behind

everything about the young foreign taxidermist was overdone did he absolutely have to wear the apron with the tiny red castles in the shop or weave at night in and out of the trees i don ’ t think so i would bring him buckets of ice water day after day hoping he would just cool off a bit fact is he never did but to be fair he really was practicing what the papers called “ heroic medicine. ” it was love i admit it it was fancy love i was the envy of the world being hitched up with such a genius and that felt good of course these days i can ’ t touch rope or a small child without thinking of him without expecting his large hands to come out of nowhere we were as mother said both “ slowly losing our minds. ” he ’ d talk for hours about hygiene the water cure for example and wrote an award-winning essay on the electric bath as a way to treat hysteria in the female fox “ too many foxes ” he would say shaking his fist “ too many foxes running around like chickens with their heads cut off. ” in the winter months we would ride our bicycles down to the scrap-metal yard where he would make love to me in devout silence the delight in his eyes when he found that small cage he was both tender and rough and i had never and will never again be as touched by another man i didn ’ t notice the black mustache growing slowly but unmercifully on his left shoulder until two or three years into the affair at first it seemed harmless a small patch of dead grass but eventually i couldn ’ t help but only see the large dark field its silent twitching by then it was already early fall and the fact is it tore us apart

sex is always monstrous blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body “ please touch me there more oh god. ” for a hitchhiker the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift itchy unsafe space on the verge of a new mexico highway it is often the sex of another era in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed i hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me ultra-american like a christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick at first my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian after all it is not really hitchhiking to buy a greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons again this is an example of departure in another time as a foreign student on scholarship it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on salman rushdie ’ s early works nevertheless “ how can we keep tabs on these ji visa holders who come over here and the university as an institution really needs to be more accountable we need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information they need to do their course work and then they need to go home. ” i didn ’ t want to go home this is a boring sentence perhaps for you oregon is a calming word evoking images of blackberry pie ocean vistas and the capture of suspected felons i had never heard the word oregon before like the distance of scotland from london it seemed impossibly far a beautiful hazard to go and keep going how can i put this in england nobody ever ever ever did this i who once drove straight to glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar in a dinged-up datsun cherry was considered an anomaly “ are you demented why do you want to drive in a car to bloody scotland it ’ s seven hours on the m1 man ” though outwardly i was wan and somewhat reticent i no i was my sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in hyde park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the london school of economics that my breasts in that position from that angle resembled two fried eggs we were meeting in a park as per the era i am sure contemporary punjabi-british teenagers are fearless individuals undaunted by the prospect of community censure back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades it is always a century in my century sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like scotland or wales and borrowing my father ’ s car forever “ are you out of your bleeding head your dad ’ s going to skin you alive ” in some sense this driving is the opposite of hitchhiking in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar the day was real in a different way back then in the way that it sensitized me to risk a kind of twin to permisson two black swans that day and this one history and fiction what i went for and what i really wanted which i didn ’ t know until i got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible considering the trouble i was already in and the rain which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets the streetlamps were pink on prince street in glasgow i saw the sign for american style pizza and went down the steps to the basement café the tables were coated with green plastic there was hot tea which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as i focused my eye on a laminated print of a white blocky rose with a pink dot at its center “ charles rennie mackintosh ” the waitress pronouncing “ osh ” so that it rhymed with horse “ are you from india ” “ would you like some jam with that scone i bet they don ’ t have scones in india do they ” “ more tea i heard you have a lot of tea over there isn ’ t that right ” plan b the extension of my throat the euphoria of theft other countries with their sayings and beliefs the original plan formulated by my father during his morning communte across london marrying a british-born hindu brahmin dentist with brown skin but not too brown and rosy cheeks note on the mantelpiece tucked behind the marble figurine of shiva what is forthcoming under the original plan extraction what kind of sex is possible on the dentist ’ s chair late at night for that girl your girl who nervously asks for a blanket she has her socks on she ’ s shivering it is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients but in this scene the limbs of the dentist ’ s young asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen-scented nail polish or mouthwash dad “ please don ’ t swallow. ” rinse then spit spit then swallow i could not go home and so after a brief visit to the hill house—charles rennie mackintosh ’ s art deco home on the firth of clyde where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy as it seemed from the décor—i turned left and kept driving i drove my car into the atlantic and kept driving my chest very tight beneath the surface it was difficult to feel anything or really to see and so i can only say that i went into a damaging ocean this is going damaged washed up on the mythical shores of new jersey a few days later my car failed to start this is later when the car stopped and looking up from my hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel i realized that i was okay now i am here in the future of color i ’ m sorry i do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival i am not interested in it i do not recall it i it was only when my car stopped that i realized what i had to do on my own terms with my own two legs get going is that how you say it get up and go the destiny of my body as separate from my childhood i came here to hitchhike i came here to complete a thing i began in another place removing wet pages from my rucksack i lay them on the shore securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles when they dried i folded them into squares and put them in my pocket next to my body misshapen exhilarated i said get i said go get up now and go “ are you okay ” “ do you need a ride somewhere ” “ let me look in the trunk i might have something in there here you go you ’ re shivering do you need to go to the hospital at least let me buy you a cup of coffee ”
1 but i was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer exhausted you lay your head on the kitchen table and said “ but what ’ s the difference between a monster and a cyborg i need something to eat do you have any chocolate ” opening the fridge i said quietly and perhaps too seriously trying to impress you “ the monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances. ” her fate her body great britain you said “ so is laloo english or british ” i said “ she ’ s from london. ” but the more i said london the more it sounded like a joke londonlondonlondon 2 i was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car this is something you can only do here wish for something did you ever do it wish you weren ’ t there i want that go on go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the panama canal or idaho hitchhiking in idaho as a veritable child i was taken in by a farming couple fatty and daddy a hundred miles or so outside of boise fatty was rail thin about seventy-five and daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife they picked me up in their truck—i was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingers—and i stayed with them for five days they said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called country buffet in my innocence i had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a kkk leader/operative charles reynold what is an operative it is someone who is always planning a way in like the hen-house fox with his beautifully red bushy tail daddy fatty and i hunkered down until daddy ’ s nephew robert stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to boise proper where there was a bus station i waited until robert had gone and then i walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers “ i can take you as far as the state line. ” “ that would be lovely. ” obsessed far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at heathrow airport or nestle the main employers in the dingy part of northwest london that constituted my origins i said yes soft yes to the color green which is going 3 that is a tree going but also an ocean a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me for you it might happen in another place mine like laloo i lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows thus a juniper tree flying by the window intensely blue or the atlantic ocean to the left if the car has a destination to the south such as to the keys is magical to me improbable in light of my origins hers the girl in the car i don ’ t know i am writing to you in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it the dress the morning of writing ahead of you is a café as if writing you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself for this reason when i think of you reading i think of you as writing blindly you read but you are also writing as if my own eyes were closed i see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl these books are separate from my own work here in the salt-water notebook but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense like birds 4 this is pre but the notebook is after soaked already at the edge and foamy past future writing on the warp when dry pages entries by hand that is the morning i woke up and walked to the pacific ocean after a night in a motel in florence oregon complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows the woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it an expatriate she said exaggeratedly oblivious to our common origin “ about four miles you ’ re not going to walk are you do you have an umbrella you can ’ t go out like that ducky. ” 5 i walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up on its forested proximal verge by gorse which is a bright yellow flower citron-yellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it the day like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain monsoon what kind of rain is this i recognized the immensity but not the temperature this was monstrous the inability to assimilate on the level of the senses an ordinary experience of weather here is the tongue for example constantly darting out to feel the air what is it is it summer is it a different season it ’ s a different day that ’ s okay damaged from her travels in some sense unsettled enormously anxious a girl does it anway gets up and goes it ’ s as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around

the last time i saw father alive he was using a black umbrella closed to beat off some pigeons hanging outside the marble portals of a museum we were visitors walking very slowly so father could stoop and examine everything we had not been in the museum but were resting on its steps we saw it all—the fountains the statues the parks and the post office cities are made of such things once we encountered a wedding coming out of the cathedral and were caught in a shower of rice as the bride flicked her veiled head father licked his little finger and in this way saved a grain on the next block he announced he was going to heaven but first let ’ s go back to the hotel and rest he said i want my mint those were practically his last words and what did i want more than anything in the world probably the ancient polish recipe for blood soup which was finally told to me in an empty deli in a deserted mill town in western massachusetts by the owner ’ s mother who was alone one day when i burst in and demanded a bowl but she said lacing her fingers around a jar of morello cherries it requires one cup of new blood drawn from the goose whose neck you ’ ve just wrung to put in the pot and where in these days can i find anything as fresh as that i had lost track of my life before but nothing prepared me for the onslaught of wayfarer ’ s bliss when she continued to list one by one the impossible ingredients i needed to live we sat at the greasy table far into the night while snow fell on the locked doors of the church next door dedicated to st. stanislas which was rumored to be beautiful inside and contain the remains of his beloved head

i was so happy in the gem room the sun was president i was just dug up all hell had shrunk to a sulphur crystal something danced on the point it must have been me i had a hundred faces and one of them served up the ceiling in a perfect slice — like a twelve-year-old saint in some countryside where they only read revelation i had some small nugget of sense for once i was a mind that understood the light ... rain rained in my aquamarine the world ’ s knuckles gripped the bedstead i felt the red dynamiting of me in missouri where all outdoors was my candy store where color sucked at its all-day self and never became less sweet less new “ i want to put it in my mouth ” said someone “ i almost want to eat it ... ” i had dozens of uses but i was mostly flat beautiful visitors just gasped in the matte-black room where i freely fluoresced they saw me laid on a dictionary to demonstrate my transparency which was complete they could read the word everything through me my name meant blood meant seawater meant lemon the eye in my agate never blinked i was believed to be formed of frozen moonlight i was cut so that a star shone back the purest and wind-clearest hunk of me they carved into a horse when i was split to the purple and somehow still standing they called me a cathedral yet just to the left of that i spilled all over velvet the velvet is what did it — i wanted to be smuggled wanted to ride past all the alarms just before that drop of sweat hit the floor wanted to end up in god- knows-whose hands a heist “ obscene ” said a man behind me “ just in piles like that ... obscene. ” then i spilled another carat laughing in missouri you could pluck me straight up off the ground gumdrops gobstoppers jujubes i thought try to suck me down to nothing and find yourself up against one million years in piles like that just out there for anyone obscene the legs of the real thing were opening flash and flash and flash i said go ahead and smash the glass give me a break-in like a kaleidoscope someone will entirely drip with me as soon as i get out of here

saturday morning in late march i was alone and took a long walk though i also carried a book of the alone which companioned me the day was clear unnaturally clear like a freshly wiped pane of glass a window over the water and blue preternaturally blue like the sky in a magritte painting and cold vividly cold so that you could clap your hands and remember winter which had left a few moments ago— if you strained you could almost see it disappearing over the hills in a black parka spring was coming but had n't arrived yet i walked on the edge of the park the wind whispered a secret to the trees which held their breath and scarcely moved on the other side of the street the skyscrapers stood on tiptoe i walked down to the pier to watch the launching of a passenger ship ice had broken up on the river and the water rippled smoothly in blue light the moon was a faint smudge in the clouds a brushstroke an afterthought in the vacant mind of the sky seagulls materialized out of vapor amidst the masts and flags do n't let our voices die on land they cawed swooping down for fish and then soaring back upwards the kiosks were opening and couples moved slowly past them arm in arm festive children darted in and out of walkways which sprouted with vendors voices greeted the air kites and balloons handmade signs voyages to unknown places the whole day had the drama of an expectation down at the water the queenly ship started moving away from the pier banners fluttered the passengers clustered at the rails on deck i stood with the people on shore and waved goodbye to the travelers some were jubilant others were broken-hearted i have always been both suddenly a great cry went up the ship set sail for the horizon and rumbled into the future but the cry persisted and cut the air like an iron bell ringing in an empty church i looked around the pier but everyone else was gone and i was left alone to peer into the ghostly distance i had no idea where that ship was going but i felt lucky to see it off and bereft when it disappeared
i can only give you back what you imagine i am a soulless man when i take you into my mouth it is not my mouth it is an unlit pit an aperture opened just enough in the pinhole camera to capture the shade i have caused you to rise up to me and i have watched as you rose and waned our times together have been innumerable still like a capistrano swallow you come back you understand i understand you understand each jiggle and tug your pudgy mercurial wad i am simply a hand inexhaustible as yours could never be you ’ re nevertheless prepared to shoot if i could i ’ d finish you be more than just your rag
for a.j verdelle those mornings i traveled north on i91 passing below the basalt cliff of east rock where the elms discussed their genealogies i was a chaplain at hartford hospital took the myers-briggs with sister margaret learned i was an i drawn to es in small group i said “ i do not like it— the way so many young black men die here unrecognized their gurneys stripped their belongings catalogued and unclaimed. ” on the neonatal icu newborns breathed blue spider-delicate in a nest of tubes a sunday of themselves their tissue purpled their eyelids the film on old water in a well their faces resigned in their see-through attics their skin mottled mildewed wallpaper it is correct to love even at the wrong time on rounds the newborns eyed me each one like orpheus in his dark hallway saying i knew i would find you i knew i would lose you

how is it that you hold such influence over me your practiced slouch your porkpie hat at rakish angle commending the dumpling-shaped lump atop your pelvis— as if we ’ ve one more thing to consider amidst the striptease of all your stanzas and all your lines— draws me down into the center of you the prize peony so that i ’ m nothing more than an ant whose singular labor is to gather the beading liquid inside you bring it to light i have never written a true poem it seems snatches of my salacious dreams sandwiched together all afternoon at my desk awaiting the dark visitation of the word when you arrive unfasten your notebook and recite i am only a schoolboy with a schoolboy ’ s hard mind you are the headmaster now you must master me
warsaw october rose-madder by four the soldierly grey boulevards slippery with tickets to winter after forty years rebuilding the old town is like this beautiful girl i knew whose face was wheel-broken in a crash and remade so well it was hard to say how she looked wrong i ’ d brought two questions here— holding them as if they might slip who were my mother ’ s people where did they die in an attic-archive—deep card indexes ink turned lilac with age—i handed my questions to a love-laborer in a yarmulke with sad palms and a shake of the head he regretted that any answers now lay probably beyond our reach so i abandoned questing and went back to tourism joined the passeggiata drank black tea got stickied under sooty lime trees saw boisterous children all knees and elbows skyline-capering on the wall at the river-divide beyond their frail silhouettes against the petrol dusk huge cranes were moving courtly confident building another new warsaw across the vistula

the girl ’ s father laughs a little too hard when i say she knows what ’ s important in life as his daughter whips the dime store jump rope over her head for the twelve thousandth time— laughs as if i ’ m joking when really she has it down— sparkly pink handles grimy with effort her face obscured by her hair shins thin and bruised socks down at the ankles abandoned by the rest of the crowd the concrete square an archipelago an alignment with rigor the others can not fathom she moves with fierce persistence into afternoon the heft of the handles smack of the rope— no double dutch limbo no communal game but this resolute definition of rhythm slatted bench shadows lengthening into space the other kids simply forgetting she ’ s there her solitary corner of the playground darkening as the dinner hour approaches while pigeons pause on their branches squirrels come down the trunk and stop with rush hour beyond the fence cars idling and the rope ’ s metronome forgotten as breath weaving all the disparate energies of girl— elation fury eagerness song— into one singular strand

for the ghost of johann sebastian bach he was born to wonder about numbers he balanced fives against tens and made them sleep together and love each other he took sixes and sevens and set them wrangling and fighting over raw bones he woke up twos and fours out of baby sleep and touched them back to sleep he managed eights and nines gave them prophet beards marched them into mists and mountains he added all the numbers he knew multiplied them by new-found numbers and called it a prayer of numbers for each of a million cipher silences he dug up a mate number for a candle light in the dark he knew love numbers luck numbers how the sea and the stars are made and held by numbers he died from the wonder of numbering he said good-by as if good-by is a number

only once did the frog come to mind when the coroner came to “ first-aid training ” at the fire station his slide carousel set up to eliminate the easy pukers the frog was not dead but its brain had been pithed which is what happens when you stick a probe into the skull and wiggle you wind up with something dead enough to let you stretch its tongue as thin and wide as a cellophane sheet which i did so eagerly back in the lab the coroner said here is the fat guy whose chihuahua gnawed through his stomach click here is the farmer who hanged himself in his silo i noted his foreshortened dangling feet click it had been thrilling to see the frog ’ s blood cells jerking through the narrow capillaries here is the woman who swallowed the bottle of drano click here is the man who just sawzall-ed his neck clean through click here is the guy who shot off his head but wait he ’ s still living which is what happens if the brain stem ’ s left intact click the coroner said we should aim for the base not the top of the skull and remember to turn down the heat click there are many people in this world on whom nobody checks in very often click the warmer the room the quicker a body will turn black and bloat click if you have a dog it is important to leave out what seems like an inordinate amount of dog food click click then there was nothing but a slab of light to signal he was through and it was then that i remembered the frog not that the coroner had spoken of frogs what he said was if we saw the cops outside smoking cigars that ’ s when we ’ d know we had a stinker

oh down at the tavern the children are singing around their round table and around me still did you hear what it said i only said how there is a pewter urn pinned to the tavern wall as old as old is able to be and be there still i said the poets are there i hear them singing and lying around their round table and around me still across the room is a wreath made of a corpse ’ s hair framed in glass on the wall as old as old is able to be and be remembered still did you hear what it said i only said how i want to be there and i would sing my songs with the liars and my lies with all the singers and i would and i would but it ’ s my hair in the hair wreath my cup pinned to the tavern wall my dusty face they sing beneath poets are sitting in my kitchen why do these poets lie why do children get children and did you hear what it said i only said how i want to be there oh down at the tavern where the prophets are singing around their round table until they are still

i am doing laps at night alone in the indoor pool outside it is snowing but i am warm and weightless suspended and out of time like a fly in amber she is thousands of miles from here and miles above me ghosting the stratosphere heading from new york to london though it is late even at that height i know her light is on her window a square of gold as she reads mysteries above the atlantic i watch the line of black tile on the pool ’ s floor leading me down the lane if she looks down by moonlight under a clear sky she will see black water she will see me swimming distantly moving far from shore suspended with her in flight through the wide gulf as we swim toward land together

here or there hundreds of them phantom-like bobbing in place at street corners then lifting their knees suddenly and leaping into the densest loudest traffic of briefest trajectories of shortest views in transit yet at ease breathing loping like bearers of distance and pure direction darting half naked out of nowhere and where where in the world are they running to swift and solitary silent beings who should you now step into the path have dodged away or if you raise a hand to stay them to speak immediately are gone who are these runners who create in their gliding such fine singular spaces among the street ’ s vociferous jargons —as if each one were a still wordless message or question one would answer if one could grasp it this one that one sliding past going away while you stand there your hand raised to no purpose your hidden heart rejoicing that the quick heel won ’ t soon won ’ t ever be overtaken although you as you have longed to suddenly disburden yourself and follow follow

ditch the meadow for me. ’ ‘ warren ’ ‘ but did he i just want to know. ’ ‘ of course he did what would you have him say surely you wouldn ’ t grudge the poor old man some humble way to save his self-respect he added if you really care to know he meant to clear the upper pasture too that sounds like something you have heard before warren i wish you could have heard the way he jumbled everything i stopped to look two or three times—he made me feel so queer— to see if he was talking in his sleep he ran on harold wilson—you remember— the boy you had in haying four years since he ’ s finished school and teaching in his college silas declares you ’ ll have to get him back he says they two will make a team for work between them they will lay this farm as smooth the way he mixed that in with other things he thinks young wilson a likely lad though daft on education—you know how they fought all through july under the blazing sun silas up on the cart to build the load harold along beside to pitch it on. ’ ‘ yes i took care to keep well out of earshot. ’ ‘ well those days trouble silas like a dream you wouldn ’ t think they would how some things linger harold ’ s young college boy ’ s assurance piqued him after so many years he still keeps finding good arguments he sees he might have used i sympathize i know just how it feels to think of the right thing to say too late harold ’ s associated in his mind with latin he asked me what i thought of harold ’ s saying he studied latin like the violin because he liked it—that an argument he said he couldn ’ t make the boy believe he could find water with a hazel prong— which showed how much good school had ever done him he wanted to go over that but most of all he thinks if he could have another chance to teach him how to build a load of hay— ’ ‘ i know that ’ s silas ’ one accomplishment he bundles every forkful in its place and tags and numbers it for future reference so he can find and easily dislodge it in the unloading silas does that well he takes it out in bunches like big birds ’ nests you never see him standing on the hay he ’ s trying to lift straining to lift himself. ’ ‘ he thinks if he could teach him that he ’ d be some good perhaps to someone in the world he hates to see a boy the fool of books poor silas so concerned for other folk and nothing to look backward to with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope so now and never any different. ’ part of a moon was falling down the west dragging the whole sky with it to the hills its light poured softly in her lap she saw it and spread her apron to it she put out her hand among the harp-like morning-glory strings taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves as if she played unheard some tenderness that wrought on him beside her in the night ‘ warren ’ she said ‘ he has come home to die you needn ’ t be afraid he ’ ll leave you this time. ’ ‘ home ’ he mocked gently ‘ yes what else but home it all depends on what you mean by home of course he ’ s nothing to us any more than was the hound that came a stranger to us out of the woods worn out upon the trail. ’ ‘ home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in. ’ ‘ i should have called it something you somehow haven ’ t to deserve. ’ warren leaned out and took a step or two picked up a little stick and brought it back and broke it in his hand and tossed it by ‘ silas has better claim on us you think than on his brother thirteen little miles as the road winds would bring him to his door silas has walked that far no doubt today why didn ’ t he go there his brother ’ s rich a somebody—director in the bank. ’ ‘ he never told us that. ’ ‘ we know it though. ’ ‘ i think his brother ought to help of course i ’ ll see to that if there is need he ought of right to take him in and might be willing to— he may be better than appearances but have some pity on silas do you think if he ’ d had any pride in claiming kin or anything he looked for from his brother he ’ d keep so still about him all this time ’ ‘ i wonder what ’ s between them. ’ ‘ i can tell you silas is what he is—we wouldn ’ t mind him— but just the kind that kinsfolk can ’ t abide he never did a thing so very bad he don ’ t know why he isn ’ t quite as good as anyone worthless though he is he won ’ t be made ashamed to please his brother. ’ ‘ i can ’ t think si ever hurt anyone. ’ ‘ no but he hurt my heart the way he lay and rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back he wouldn ’ t let me put him on the lounge you must go in and see what you can do i made the bed up for him there tonight you ’ ll be surprised at him—how much he ’ s broken his working days are done i 'm sure of it. ’ ‘ i ’ d not be in a hurry to say that. ’ ‘ i haven ’ t been go look see for yourself but warren please remember how it is he ’ s come to help you ditch the meadow he has a plan you mustn ’ t laugh at him he may not speak of it and then he may i ’ ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud will hit or miss the moon. ’ it hit the moon then there were three there making a dim row the moon the little silver cloud and she warren returned—too soon it seemed to her slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited ‘ warren ’ she questioned ‘ dead ’ was all he answered
de vulgari eloquentia i i “ we will endeavor the word aiding us from heaven to be of service to the vernacular speech ” —from “ heaven ” these “ draughts of the sweetest honey-milk ” si dolcemente from the language we first heard endearments whisperings infant song and revery a world we wanted to go out into to come to ourselves into organizations in the sound of them verging upon meaning upon “ heaven ” hermetic talk into which my range of understandings was to grow for love of it portents and adults expounding controversial doctrines personal science fictions and rules of order but our own “ is that which we acquire without any rule ” for love of it “ imitating our nurses ”
there was never a sound beside the wood but one and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground what was it it whispered i knew not well myself perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun something perhaps about the lack of sound— and that was why it whispered and did not speak it was no dream of the gift of idle hours or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers pale orchises and scared a bright green snake the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make
the buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard and made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it and from there those that lifted eyes could count five mountain ranges one behind the other under the sunset far into vermont and the saw snarled and rattled snarled and rattled as it ran light or had to bear a load and nothing happened day was all but done call it a day i wish they might have said to please the boy by giving him the half hour that a boy counts so much when saved from work his sister stood beside him in her apron to tell them ‘ supper. ’ at the word the saw as if to prove saws knew what supper meant leaped out at the boy ’ s hand or seemed to leap— he must have given the hand however it was neither refused the meeting but the hand the boy ’ s first outcry was a rueful laugh as he swung toward them holding up the hand half in appeal but half as if to keep the life from spilling then the boy saw all— since he was old enough to know big boy doing a man ’ s work though a child at heart— he saw all spoiled ‘ don ’ t let him cut my hand off— the doctor when he comes don ’ t let him sister ’ so but the hand was gone already the doctor put him in the dark of ether he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath and then—the watcher at his pulse took fright no one believed they listened at his heart little—less—nothing —and that ended it no more to build on there and they since they were not the one dead turned to their affairs

they are human after all you think as the waiter steps up to a table out of sight of you reserved corner table— they too are thin-skinned and pleasure-seeking with their own feelings and their own sufferings you ’ re not so all alone in your mess your restlessness your shakes they too will be full of doubt dither shilly-shallying even if it ’ s all about making deals the universal-human albeit in its commercial manifestations but present there too truly the grief of hearts is ubiquitous and unending but whether they were ever in love outwith the awful wedded bed burning athirst desert-parched for the nectar of a faraway mouth sinking drowning in the impossibility of a union of souls— you won ’ t know nor can you ask the waiter who ’ s just ringing up another bock always avid for coupons to quench a thirst of another nature though also deep
not reading english and hearing about a new english thriller that hasn ’ t been translated seeing a cold beer when it ’ s hot out and not being able to afford it having an idea that you can ’ t encapsulate in a line of hölderlin the way the professors do hearing the waves beat against the shore on holiday at night and telling yourself it ’ s what they always do very bad being invited out when your own room at home is quieter the coffee is better and you don ’ t have to make small talk and worst of all not to die in summer when the days are long and the earth yields easily to the spade
ink runs from the corners of my mouth there is no happiness like mine i have been eating poetry the librarian does not believe what she sees her eyes are sad and she walks with her hands in her dress the poems are gone the light is dim the dogs are on the basement stairs and coming up their eyeballs roll their blond legs burn like brush the poor librarian begins to stamp her feet and weep she does not understand when i get on my knees and lick her hand she screams i am a new man i snarl at her and bark i romp with joy in the bookish dark
there is joy in the woods just now the leaves are whispers of song and the birds make mirth on the bough and music the whole day long and god to dwell in the town in these springlike summer days on my brow an unfading frown and hate in my heart always— a machine out of gear aye tired yet forced to go on—for i ’ m hired just forced to go on through fear for every day i must eat and find ugly clothes to wear and bad shoes to hurt my feet and a shelter for work-drugged sleep a mere drudge but what can one do a man that ’ s a man can not weep suicide a quitter oh no but a slave should never grow tired whom the masters have kindly hired but oh for the woods the flowers of natural sweet perfume the heartening summer showers and the smiling shrubs in bloom dust-free dew-tinted at morn the fresh and life-giving air the billowing waves of corn and the birds ’ notes rich and clear — for a man-machine toil-tired may crave beauty too—though he ’ s hired

it ’ s a strange time which finds me jogging in early morning the deadness of sleep alive in this world the empty parks filled with unloved strangers buildings grey with solitude now near the end of another decade i am witness to the loss of my twenties a promise invisible i run without purpose far from the north star i run with the sound of barking dogs closing in i have lost count of the miles i am older and nothing much matters or has changed
inside the car françois and i could see the light coming from the cigarette michele duvalier was smoking her husband declared president for life looked like a fat chauffeur sitting beind the wheel françois and i smiled the small procession of cars slipping past us in the dark we did not know that a few miles away people were already celebrating nor could we see joy on the faces of the men who ran holding knives and sticks to the place where papa doc was buried tonight even ghosts will die as françois and i walk barefoot at the center of port-au-prince
i think i know what sort of person i am but then i think but this stranger will imagine me quite otherwise when he or she hears this or that to my credit for instance that i have a position at the university the fact that i have a position at the university will appear to mean that i must be the sort of person who has a position at the university but then i have to admit with surprise that after all it is true that i have a position at the university and if it is true then perhaps i really am the sort of person you imagine when you hear that a person has a position at the university but on the other hand i know i am not the sort of person i imagine when i hear that a person has a position at the university then i see what the problem is when others describe me this way they appear to describe me completely whereas in fact they do not describe me completely and a complete description of me would include truths that seem quite incompatible with the fact that i have a position at the university
how untouchable the girls arm-locked strutting up the main hall of central high unopposed for decades looked i flattened myself against the wall unnerved by their cloudsea of élan which pounced upon any timid girl regrettably in their way their high-wattage lifting slow motion like curls of light strands of honey the swagger behind their blue-tinted sunglasses and low-rider jeans hurt boys like me so vast the worlds between us even the slightest whiff of recognition an accidental side glance an unintended tongue-piercing display of juicy fruit chew was intoxicating and could wildly cast a chess-playing geek into a week-long surmise of inner doubts likelihoods and depressions you might say my whole life led to celebrating youth and how it snubs and rebuffs back then i learned to avoid what i feared and to place my third-string hopes on a game-winning basketball shot sure it would slow them to a stop pan their lip-glossed smiles blessing me with their cool

oft have i seen at some cathedral door a laborer pausing in the dust and heat lay down his burden and with reverent feet enter and cross himself and on the floor kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er far off the noises of the world retreat the loud vociferations of the street become an undistinguishable roar so as i enter here from day to day and leave my burden at this minster gate kneeling in prayer and not ashamed to pray the tumult of the time disconsolate to inarticulate murmurs dies away while the eternal ages watch and wait ii how strange the sculptures that adorn these towers this crowd of statues in whose folded sleeves birds build their nests while canopied with leaves parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers and the vast minster seems a cross of flowers but fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves watch the dead christ between the living thieves and underneath the traitor judas lowers ah from what agonies of heart and brain what exultations trampling on despair what tenderness what tears what hate of wrong what passionate outcry of a soul in pain uprose this poem of the earth and air this mediæval miracle of song i enter and i see thee in the gloom of the long aisles o poet saturnine and strive to make my steps keep pace with thine the air is filled with some unknown perfume the congregation of the dead make room for thee to pass the votive tapers shine like rooks that haunt ravenna 's groves of pine the hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb from the confessionals i hear arise rehearsals of forgotten tragedies and lamentations from the crypts below and then a voice celestial that begins with the pathetic words `` although your sins as scarlet be '' and ends with `` as the snow '' with snow-white veil and garments as of flame she stands before thee who so long ago filled thy young heart with passion and the woe from which thy song and all its splendors came and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name the ice about thy heart melts as the snow on mountain heights and in swift overflow comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame thou makest full confession and a gleam as of the dawn on some dark forest cast seems on thy lifted forehead to increase lethe and eunoë — the remembered dream and the forgotten sorrow — bring at last that perfect pardon which is perfect peace i lift mine eyes and all the windows blaze with forms of saints and holy men who died here martyred and hereafter glorified and the great rose upon its leaves displays christ 's triumph and the angelic roundelays with splendor upon splendor multiplied and beatrice again at dante 's side no more rebukes but smiles her words of praise and then the organ sounds and unseen choirs sing the old latin hymns of peace and love and benedictions of the holy ghost and the melodious bells among the spires o'er all the house-tops and through heaven above proclaim the elevation of the host o star of morning and of liberty o bringer of the light whose splendor shines above the darkness of the apennines forerunner of the day that is to be the voices of the city and the sea the voices of the mountains and the pines repeat thy song till the familiar lines are footpaths for the thought of italy thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights through all the nations and a sound is heard as of a mighty wind and men devout strangers of rome and the new proselytes in their own language hear thy wondrous word and many are amazed and many doubt
to wake when all is possible before the agitations of the day have gripped you to come to the kitchen and peel a little basketball for breakfast to tear the husk like cotton padding a cloud of oil misting out of its pinprick pores clean and sharp as pepper to ease each pale pink section out of its case so carefully without breaking a single pearly cell to slide each piece into a cold blue china bowl the juice pooling until the whole fruit is divided from its skin and only then to eat so sweet a discipline precisely pointless a devout involvement of the hands and senses a pause a little emptiness each year harder to live within each year harder to live without

the world is full of mostly invisible things and there is no way but putting the mind ’ s eye or its nose in a book to find them out things like the square root of everest or how many times byron goes into texas or whether the law of the excluded middle applies west of the rockies for these and the like reasons you have to go to school and study books and listen to what you are told and sometimes try to remember though i don ’ t know what you will do with the mean annual rainfall on plato ’ s republic or the calorie content of the diet of worms such things are said to be good for you and you will have to learn them in order to become one of the grown-ups who sees invisible things neither steadily nor whole but keeps gravely the grand confusion of the world under his hat which is where it belongs and teaches small children to do this in their turn
here with my beer i sit while golden moments flit alas they pass unheeded by and as they fly i being dry sit idly sipping here my beer o finer far than fame or riches are the graceful smoke-wreaths of this free cigar why should i weep wail or sigh what if luck has passed me by what if my hopes are dead — my pleasures fled have i not still my fill of right good cheer — cigars and beer go whining youth forsooth go weep and wail sigh and grow pale weave melancholy rhymes on the old times whose joys like shadowy ghosts appear — but leave me to my beer gold is dross — love is loss — so if i gulp my sorrows down or see them drown in foamy draughts of old nut-brown then do i wear the crown without the cross

several of my cousins lean up against the house taking long drags from the pack of marlboros we share we have always been this way —addicted and generous a pow wow tape plays from inside the open garage where two old uncles are thinking to themselves in the safety of its shadows our aunties are in the kitchen preparing the boiled meat and chokecherry soup and laughing about old jokes they still hang onto because these things are a matter of survival outside we ask about who was driving around with who last night where so-and-so got beat up whose girlfriend left him for someone else but she ’ ll go back to him we all think to ourselves aunties carry the full pots and pans to the picnic table an uncle prays over our food in assiniboine we all want to forget that we don ’ t understand this language we spend lots of time trying to forget in different ways no one notices that the wild turnips are still simmering in a pot on the stove
man looking into the sea— taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself— it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing but you can not stand in the middle of this the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave the firs stand in a procession—each with an emerald turkey-foot at the top— reserved as their contours saying nothing repression however is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea the sea is a collector quick to return a rapacious look there are others besides you who have worn that look— whose expression is no longer a protest the fish no longer investigate them for their bones have not lasted men lower nets unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave and row quickly away—the blades of the oars moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death the wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanx—beautiful under networks of foam and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed the birds swim through the air at top speed emitting cat-calls as heretofore— the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs in motion beneath them and the ocean under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys advances as usual looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink— in which if they turn and twist it is neither with volition nor consciousness

what i like about your country she tells me is the toilets i wouldn ’ t mind bringing one home but it wouldn ’ t do much good she says she likes the bathtubs and the refrigerators but she is not so crazy about the tortillas which are not made properly or the cilantro which tastes like soap also the freeways ruin the landscape and the children watch television when they could be playing soccer and the teenagers stare at their parents with bare faces that say give it to me and the abuelitos are like dogs to the children the children walk by with no respect mangoes here are not so good not enough rain and the women here have so many clothes i think your country has the most wonderful bathrooms and everyone has a house although tents would be nicer i think or boats or even just sleeping in a tree my family has a tree we live under but the tree has no toilet i grant you that
when he read in the obituary section that he was dead the famous author was at first amused and flattered they love me so much he thought they have imagined me dead because they fear the loss of my genius above all else so he put on his hat combed his goatee to a waxed point and sauntered out of his flat to attend his own funeral how literary he thought like huck finn and everyone will be weeping he was perturbed however when he found that the funeral home was in a bad section of town next to a tattoo parlor named the desultory slut he walked in past the unmanned front desk to a back room of frayed velvet and gilt columns where his coffin was on display a faux mahogany monstrosity with painted pewter handles the only people in attendance were four young professors from the local college with leather patches on the elbows of their ill-fitting tweed jackets and long cruel faces of foxes and rats he recognized one of them a gangly fellow with pimply cheeks who had shaken his hand after his last reading and reverently asked for his signature do you have one of my books to sign the author had asked oh no the young professor had cried baring his hairless chest can you please sign here now the pimply fellow was sitting in a pew whispering loudly to his neighbor isn ’ t it great he said the old bastard finally kicked his neighbor nodded silently deeply disturbed but well aware of the dramatic potential of the moment the author took this as his cue to step boldly into the room with a loud ta daaa for some reason the professors ignored him and continued their whispering for a moment he was afflicted with a strange vertigo and stood like a clay golem without a will of his own then a sudden rage took him and the author snapped out of the spell and strode to the front of the room waving his arms wait i ’ m not dead at all here i am it was all a mistake he cried but the professors did not see him in fact one walked right through him as if he were merely a ghost or spirit and rushed up to the coffin do you realize what this means the professor cried this means we ’ re free and he grabbed the body in the coffin and dragged it to the floor the shocked author saw in the body his own likeness lips and cheeks rouged into a grotesque semblance of life he ’ s dead he ’ s dead our enemy is finally dead they chanted in a frenzy and the professors began trampling on the corpse weeping with joy and relief

when i was a child i knew red miners dressed raggedly and wearing carbide lamps i saw them come down red hills to their camps dyed with red dust from old ishkooda mines night after night i met them on the roads or on the streets in town i caught their glance the swing of dinner buckets in their hands and grumbling undermining all their words i also lived in low cotton country where moonlight hovered over ripe haystacks or stumps of trees and croppers ’ rotting shacks with famine terror flood and plague near by where sentiment and hatred still held sway and only bitter land was washed away
my mother sleeps with the bible open on her pillow she reads herself to sleep and wakens startled she listens for her heart each breath is shallow for years her hands were quick with thread and needle she used to sew all night when we were little now she sleeps with the bible on her pillow and believes that jesus understands her sorrow her children grown their father frail and brittle she stitches in her heart her breathing shallow once she even slept fast rushed tomorrow mornings full of sunlight sons and daughters now she sleeps alone with the bible on her pillow and wakes alone and feels the house is hollow though my father in his blue room stirs and mutters she listens to him breathe each breath is shallow i flutter down the darkened hallway shadow between their dreams my mother and my father asleep in rooms i pass my breathing shallow i leave the bible open on her pillow

i was always leaving i was about to get up and go i was on my way not sure where somewhere else not here nothing here was good enough it would be better there where i was going not sure how or why the dome i cowered under would be raised and i would be released into my true life i would meet there the ones i was destined to meet they would make an opening for me among the flutes and boulders and i would be taken up that this might be a form of death did not occur to me i only know that something held me back a doubt a debt a face i could not leave behind when the door fell open i did not go through

finding an old book on a basement shelf— gray spine bent—and reading it again i met my former unfamiliar self some of her notes and scrawls so alien that though i tried i could n't get behind this gloss or that back to the time she wrote to guess what experiences she had in mind the living context of some scribbled note or see the girl beneath the purple ink who chose this phrase or that to underline the mood the boy that lay behind her thinking— but they were thoughts i recognized as mine and though there were words i could n't even read blobs and cross-outs and though not a jot remained of her old existence—i agreed with the young annotator 's every thought a clever girl so what would she see fit to comment on—and what would she have to say about the years that she and i have written since—before we put the book away

you 're telling that story again about your childhood when you were five years old and rode your blue bicycle from copenhagen to espergaerde and it was night and snowing by the time you arrived and your grandparents were so relieved to see you because all day no one knew where you were you had vanished we sit at our patio table under a faded green umbrella drinking wine in california 's blue autumn red stars of roses along the fence trellising over the roof of our ramshackle garage too soon the wine glasses will be empty our stories told the house covered with pine needles the wind has shaken from the trees other people will live here we will vanish like children who traveled far in the dark stars of snow in their hair riding to enchanted espergaerde
blurring the window the snowflakes numb white lanterns she 's brewed her coffee in the bathroom sprays cologne and sets her lipstick upright on the sink the door ajar i glimpse the yellow slip the rose-colored birthmark on her shoulder then she 's dressed—the pillbox hat and ersatz fur and i 'm dressed too mummified in stocking cap and scarves and i walk her to the bus stop where she 'll leave me for my own walk to school where she 'll board the bus that zigzags to st. paul as i watch her at the window the paperback romance already open on her lap the bus laboring off into snow her good-bye kiss still startling my cheek with lipstick trace
i sit with my railroad face and ask god to forgive me for being a straight line toward the dead who were buried with their poor clothes in the arizona desert of iron borders this way of waving to the embers of the past not apologzing for carrying torn rosaries inside my pockets where beads of worry became fossilized insects whose dry husks i kept since a child faces adopted me from boys who hated their parents i was told not to repeat this reminded by the priest who unmasked himself i was told there was a great horror down the hallway of the smelly catholic school once my friend joey jumped off the second floor window and flattened his brains over the asphalt yard i see a hibiscus blossom it is a bright yellow flower that lasts one day its shape brings tears saves me from the hummingbird that dots the air with patterns resembling an alphabet too familiar to smell like a railroad worker i love heaven when i admit the spikes and the railroad ties came from the labor of fate and not the labor of love the tracks are my cross the tiny car is full of sweating men they look into the eye of the sun hold their hammers over their blackened heads if staring grows in the common search a perfume dots the heart with greed silence between the lightning of pounding stakes once i rode the train home to see if the smoke from the speeding engine was going to enter my lungs i never wore the old yellow hat of the crew but returned the shovel and the bag of railroad spikes thought i saw my grandfather the foreman running across the desert in overalls changing his skin from brown to the black of the scorched engine i live with my railroad face its smoothness hammered by sweating crews that knew the line of hot iron was going to end in the west someday i live with my railroad face and don ’ t know why the tracks disappear on the horizon i cross my railroad face and comb my hair
my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee i was sired and weaned in a tropic world the palm tree and banana leaf mango and coconut breadfruit and rubber trees know me warm skies and gulf blue streams are in my blood i belong with the smell of fresh pine with the trail of coon and the spring growth of wild onion i am no hothouse bulb to be reared in steam-heated flats with the music of el and subway in my ears walled in by steel and wood and brick far from the sky i want the cotton fields tabacco and the cane i want to walk along with sacks of seed to drop in fallow ground restless music is in my heart and i am eager to be gone o southland sorrow home melody beating in my bone and blood how long will the klan of hate the hounds and the chain gangs keep me from my own
on turning forty they draw me closer like the hands of one grandmother i kissed upon visiting her in the barrio the magnets make me look at my waist wondering why the ache is in the street houses giving off stinking air a magnetic field collecting old newspapers broken-down cars alleys where the drummer cowers before he beats on his bag of beer cans i visit the irrigation canal that churns green and flows beyond the streets wait for the alligator to swim by the one released from the plaza long ago i feel the pull toward the mongrel dog the clicking of the magnets in the church an attraction for open doorways i remove the magnet from my neck a medal of a denied saint i will never witness the migration of bats again stand at the entrance of the caverns as bats shoot out of the opening the evening bristling with their intelligence the sky bruises against the horizon of yucca plants erect as magnets surrrounding the cavern miles of yucca encircling the poles to protect them from the wind that pulls me into the hole he tells me to believe what i have seen insists magnetic force comes from the blade the woman wanting us to keep something for her he says magnets are missing metals from an underground wound a husband ’ s wrist broken by a slammed car hood loyal dance of an old couple watching the street he says tortillas and menudo attract flies he learned red chili kills all life insists magnets let him sleep fulfilled delicious food he fixes long after his wife has died he cries that the magnets get stronger when he peels the pods to find no difference in the seeds of hunger and the seeds of love i climb the rocks because the minerals are there ascend to where i buried the seashell rusted can and pencil twenty-eight years ago i reach the rocks because i am allowed one mountain climbing to readjust the magnets then i stand and look down i clear my chest of a fist encountered up here set my foot on the humming slab i move to survive when i touch my heart i climb higher before deciding to bend and dig
my life had stood a loaded gun in corners till a day the owner passed identified and carried me away and now we roam in sovreign woods and now we hunt the doe and every time i speak for him the mountains straight reply and do i smile such cordial light opon the valley glow it is as a vesuvian face had let it ’ s pleasure through and when at night our good day done i guard my master ’ s head ’ tis better than the eider duck ’ s deep pillow to have shared to foe of his i ’ m deadly foe none stir the second time on whom i lay a yellow eye or an emphatic thumb though i than he may longer live he longer must than i for i have but the power to kill without the power to die
god washes clean the souls and hearts of you his favored ones whose backs bend o ’ er the soil which grudging gives to them requite for toil in sober graces and in vision true god places in your hands the pow ’ r to do a service sweet your gift supreme to foil the bare-fanged wolves of hunger in the moil of life ’ s activities yet all too few your glorious band clean sprung from nature ’ s heart the hope of hungry thousands in whose breast dwells fear that you should fail god placed no dart of war within your hands but pow ’ r to start tears praise love joy enwoven in a crest to crown you glorious brave ones of the soil
my garden is the wild sea of the grass her garden shelters between walls the tide could break in i should be sorry for this there is peace there of a kind though not the deep peace of wild places her care for green life has enabled the weak things to grow despite my first love i take sometimes her hand following straight paths between flowers the nostril clogged with their thick scent the old softness of lawns persuading the slow foot leads to defection the silence holds with its gloved hand the wild hawk of the mind but not for long windows opening in the trees call the mind back to its true eyrie i stoop here only in play
in memory of the painters paul klee and paul terence feeley i the painter ’ s eye follows relation out his work is not to paint the visible he says it is to render visible being a man and not a god he stands already in a world of sense from which he borrows to begin with mental things chiefly the abstract elements of language the point the line the plane the colors and the geometric shapes of these he spins relation out he weaves its fabric up so that it speaks darkly as music does singing the secret history of the mind and when in this the visible world appears as it does do mountain flower cloud and tree all haunted here and there with the human face it happens as by accident although the accident is of design it is because language first rises from the speechless world that the painterly intelligence can say correctly that he makes his world not imitates the one before his eyes hence the delightsome gardens the dark shores the terrifying forests where nightfall enfolds a lost and tired traveler and hence the careless crowd deludes itself by likening his hieroglyphic signs and secret alphabets to the drawing of a child that likeness is significant the other side of what they see for his simplicities are not the first ones but the furthest ones final refinements of his thought made visible he is the painter of the human mind finding and faithfully reflecting the mindfulness that is in things and not the things themselves for such a man art is an act of faith prayer the study of it as blake says and praise the practice nor does he divide making from teaching or from theory the three are one and in his hours of art there shines a happiness through darkest themes as though spirit and sense were not at odds ii the painter as an allegory of the mind at genesis he takes a burlap bag tears it open and tacks it on a stretcher he paints it black because as he has said everything looks different on black suppose the burlap bag to be the universe and black because its volume is the void before the stars were at the painter ’ s hand volume becomes one-sidedly a surface and all his depths are on the face of it against this flat abyss this groundless ground of zero thickness stretched against the cold dark silence of the absolutely not material worlds arise the colored earths and oil of plants that imitate the light they imitate the light that is in thought for the mind relates to thinking as the eye relates to light only because the world already is a language can the painter speak according to his grammar of the ground it is archaic speech that has not yet divided out its cadences in words it is a language for the oldest spells about how some thoughts rose into the mind while others stranger still sleep in the world so grows the garden green the sun vermilion he sees the rose flame up and fade and fall and be the same rose still the radiant in red he paints his language and his language is the theory of what the painter thinks iii the painter ’ s eye attends to death and birth together seeing a single energy momently manifest in every form as in the tree the growing of the tree exploding from the seed not more nor less than from the void condensing down and in summoning sun and rain he views the tree the great tree standing in the garden say as thrusting downward its vast spread and weight growing its green height from the dark watered earth and as suspended weightless in the sky haled forth and held up by the hair of its head he follows through the flowing of the forms from the divisions of the trunk out to the veinings of the leaf and the leaf ’ s fall his pencil meditates the many in the one after the method in the confluence of rivers the running of ravines on mountainsides and in the deltas of the nerves he sees how things must be continuous with themselves as with whole worlds that they themselves are not in order that they may be so transformed he stands where the eternity of thought opens upon perspective time and space he watches mind become incarnate then he paints the tree iv these thoughts have chiefly been about the painter klee about how he in our hard time might stand to us especially whose lives concern themselves with learning as patron of the practical intelligence of art and thence as model modest and humorous in sufferings for all research that follows spirit where it goes that there should be much goodness in the world much kindness and intelligence candor and charm and that it all goes down in the dust after a while this is a subject for the steadiest meditations of the heart and mind as for the tears that clarify the eye toward charity so may it be to all of us that at some times in this bad time when faith in study seems to fail and when impatience in the street and still despair at home divide the mind to rule it there shall be some comfort come from the remembrance of so deep and clear a life as his whom i have thought of for the wholeness of his mind as the painter dreaming in the scholar ’ s house his dream an emblem to us of the life of thought the same dream that then flared before intelligence when light first went forth looking for the eye
two young men—you just might call them boys— waiting for the woodward streetcar to get them downtown yes they ’ re tired they ’ re also dirty and happy happy because they ’ ve finished a short work week and if they ’ re not rich they ’ re as close to rich as they ’ ll ever be in this town are they truly brothers you could ask the husky one the one in the black jacket he fills to bursting he seems friendly enough snapping his fingers while he shakes his ass and sings “ sweet lorraine ” or if you ’ re put off by his mocking tone ask the one leaning against the locked door of ruby ’ s rib shack the one whose eyelids flutter in time with nothing tell him it ’ s crucial to know if in truth this is brotherly love he won ’ t get angry he ’ s too tired for anger too relieved to be here he won ’ t even laugh though he ’ ll find you silly it ’ s thursday maybe a holy day somewhere else maybe the sabbath but these two neither devout nor cynical have no idea how to worship except by doing what they ’ re doing singing a song about a woman they love merely for her name breathing in and out the used and soiled air they wouldn ’ t know how to live without and by filling the twin bodies they ’ ve disguised as filth

there was a melon fresh from the garden so ripe the knife slurped as it cut it into six slices the children were going back to school their mother passing out paper plates would not live to see the leaves fall i remember a hornet too that flew in through the open window mad to taste the sweet fruit while we ducked and screamed covered our heads and faces and sat laughing after it was gone
the summer everyone left for the moon even those yet to be born and the dead who can ’ t vacation here but met us all there by the veil between worlds the number one song in america was “ in the year 2525 ” because who has ever lived in the present when there ’ s so much of the future to continue without us how the best lover won ’ t need to forgive you and surely take everything off your hands without having to ask without knowing your name no matter the number of times you married or didn ’ t your favorite midnight movie the cigarettes you couldn ’ t give up wanting to kiss other people you shouldn ’ t and now to forever be kissed by the earth in the earth with the earth when we all briefly left it to look back on each other from above shocked by how bright even our pain is running wildly beside us like an underground river and whatever language is good for a sign a message left up there that reads here men from the planet earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 a.d. we came in peace for all mankind then returned to continue the war

my father was a tall man and yet the ripened rye would come above his shoulders the spears shot up so high my father was a tall man and yet the tasseled corn would hide him when he cut the stalks upon a frosty morn the green things grew so lushly in the valley of my birth where else could one witness the luxuriance of earth the plow would turn so rhythmically the loose unfettered loam there was no need of effort to drive the coulter home my father walked behind his team before the sun was high fine as a figure on a frieze cut sharp against the sky and when he swung the cradle in the yellow of the grain he could command all eyes around or when he drove the wain i wonder if his acres now that lie so far away are waiting for his footprint at the coming of the day i wonder if the brown old barn that still is standing long and ghostly cattle in the stalls are waiting for his song

this was gruesome—fighting over a ham sandwich with one of the tiny cats of rome he leaped on my arm and half hung on to the food and half hung on to my shirt and coat i tore it apart and let him have his portion i think i lifted him down sandwich and all on the sidewalk and sat with my own sandwich beside him maybe i petted his bony head and felt him shiver i have told this story over and over some things root in the mind his boldness of course was frightening and unexpected—his stubbornness—though hunger drove him mad it was the breaking of boundaries the sudden invasion but not only that it was the sharing of food and the sharing of space he didn't run into an alley or into a cellar he sat beside me eating and i did n't run into a trattoria say shaking with food on my lips and blood on my cheek sobbing but not only that i had gone there to eat and wait for someone i had maybe an hour before she would come and i was full of hope and excitement i have resisted for years interpreting this but now i think i was given a clue or i was giving myself a clue across the street from the glass sandwich shop that was my last night with her the next day i would leave on the train for paris and she would meet her husband thirty-five years ago i ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms we were dying together we never met again although she was pregnant when i left her—i have a daughter or son somewhere darling grandchildren in norwich connecticut or canton ohio every five years i think about her again and plan on looking her up the last time i was sitting in new brunswick new jersey and heard that her husband was teaching at princeton if she was still married or still alive and tried calling i went that far we lived in florence and rome we rowed in the bay of naples and floated naked on the boards i started to think of her again today i still am horrified by the cat 's hunger i still am puzzled by the connection this is another insane devotion there must be hundreds although it is n't just that there is no pain and the thought is fleeting and sweet i think it 's my own dumb boyhood walking around with slavic cheeks and burning stupid eyes i think i gave the cat half of my sandwich to buy my life i think i broke it in half as a decent sacrifice it was this i bought the red coleus the split rocking chair the silk lampshade happiness i watched him with pleasure i bought memory i could have lost it how crazy it sounds his face twisted with cunning the wind blowing through his hair his jaw working

not soon as late as the approach of my ninetieth year i felt a door opening in me and i entered the clarity of early morning one after another my former lives were departing like ships together with their sorrow and the countries cities gardens the bays of seas assigned to my brush came closer ready now to be described better than they were before i was not separated from people grief and pity joined us we forget—i kept saying—that we are all children of the king for where we come from there is no division into yes and no into is was and will be we were miserable we used no more than a hundredth part of the gift we received for our long journey moments from yesterday and from centuries ago— a sword blow the painting of eyelashes before a mirror of polished metal a lethal musket shot a caravel staving its hull against a reef—they dwell in us waiting for a fulfillment i knew always that i would be a worker in the vineyard as are all men and women living at the same time whether they are aware of it or not

as the morning advanced the sun became bright and warm cloudless calm serene about nine an appearance very unusual began to demand our attention—a shower of cobwebs falling from very elevated regions continuing without any interruption till the close of the day there is a natural occurrence to be met with upon the highest part of our down in hot summer days and that is a loud audible humming of bees in the air though not one insect is to be seen in a district so diversified as this so full of hollow vales and hanging woods it is no wonder that echoes should abound many we have discovered that return a tunable ring of bells or the melody of birds but we were still at a loss for a polysyllabical articulate echo till a young gentleman who had parted from his company in a summer walk and was calling after them stumbled upon a very curious one in a spot where it might least be expected we procured a cuckoo and cutting open the breastbone and exposing the intestines to sight found the crop lying as mentioned above this stomach was large and round and stuffed hard like a pincushion with food which upon nice examination we found to consist of various insects such as small scarabs spiders and dragon-flies the last of which as they were just emerging out of the aurelia state we have seen cuckoos catching on the wing among this farrago also were to be seen maggots and many seeds which belonged either to gooseberries currants cranberries or some such fruit all nature is so full that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined gilbert white 1 upon first opening a cuckoo i saw the sweet-briar bon-fire strawberry wire now relaxed into intricate thicket it was as if seen in strong sunlight flat tapestried all edge definition here an airy bone shaped like a plowshare there vibratory membranes within a space from which the song must come a syrinx hollow pipes of reeds now silent in return to the ‘ salliter ’ of earth little more than a drift

dilations expansions of the hills— to pull the most slender stalk is to jostle the stars between the bearded grass man ‘ looking in the vegatable glass of nature ’ is a network of roots suckers fine

rocks trees beasts is divided there its origins strain precedes the sound by as much as echoes follow after the quivering of ‘ cow-quake ’ a ‘ loud audible humming of bees on the down ’ stresses within the sustaining earth clouds of fleece mare ’ s tail i saw with single eye the facet of the fly— the infinitesimal mechanics all the metallic sheens of a blue-bottle in a land where the sun

as a leaf startles out from an undifferentiated mass of foliage so the word did from a leaf— a mirage of the delicate polyglot inventing itself as cipher but this in shifts gyrations grew in brightness so bright the massy poplars soon outshone the sun ‘ my light—my dews—my breezes—my bloom ’ reflections in a wren ’ s eye 5 de vegetabilibus for there are splendors of flowers called day ’ s

the last days of the summer bright and clear shines the warm sun down on the quiet land where corn-fields thick and heavy in the ear are slowly ripening for the laborer ’ s hand seed-time and harvest — since the bow was set not vainly has man hoped your coming yet to the quick rush of sickles joyously the reapers in the yellow wheat-fields sung and bound the pale sheaves of the ripened rye when the first tassels of the maize were hung that precious seed into the furrow cast earliest in spring-time crowns the harvest last ever when summer ’ s sun burns faint and dim and rare and few the pleasant days are given when the sweet praise of our thankgiving hymn makes beautiful music in the ear of heaven i think of other harvests whence the sound of singing comes not as the sheaves are bound not where the rice-fields whiten in the sun and the warm south casts down her yellow fruit shout they the labors of the autumn done — for there oppression casts her deadly root and they who sow and gather in that clime share not the treasures of the harvest-time god of the seasons thou who didst ordain bread for the eater who shall plant the soil how have they heard thee who have forged the chain and built the dungeon for the sons of toil burdening their hearts not with the voice of prayer but the dull cries of almost dumb despair they who would see that growth of wickedness planted where now the peaceful prairie waves and make the green paths of our wilderness red with the torn and bleeding feet of slaves — forbid it heaven and let the sharp axe be laid at the root of that most poison tree let us behold its deadly leaves begin a fainter shadow o ’ er the world to cast and the long day that nursed its growth of sin wane to a sunset that shall be its last so that the day-star rising from the sea shall light a land whose children will be free

i could n't have waited by the time you return it would have rotted on the vine so i cut the first tomato into eighths salted the pieces in the dusk and found the flesh not mealy like last year 's or bitter even when i swallowed the green crown of the stem that made my throat feel dusty and warm pah i could have gagged on the sweetness the miser accused by her red sums better had i eaten the dirt itself on this the first night in my life when i have not been too busy for my loneliness— at last it comes

thel 's motto does the eagle know what is in the pit or wilt thou go ask the mole can wisdom be put in a silver rod or love in a golden bowl i the daughters of mne seraphim led round their sunny flocks all but the youngest she in paleness sought the secret air to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of adona her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew o life of this our spring why fades the lotus of the water why fade these children of the spring born but to smile fall ah thel is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infants face like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air ah gentle may i lay me down and gentle rest my head and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gentle hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time the lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass answer 'd the lovely maid and said i am a watry weed and i am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales so weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou new-born lilly flower thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shalt be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal vales then why should thel complain why should the mistress of the vales of har utter a sigh she ceasd smild in tears then sat down in her silver shrine thel answered o thou little virgin of the peaceful valley giving to those that can not crave the voiceless the o'ertired thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb he smells thy milky garments he crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints thy wine doth purify the golden honey thy perfume which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow tames the fire-breathing steed but thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place '' `` queen of the vales '' the lily answered `` ask the tender cloud and it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky and why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air descend o little cloud hover before the eyes of thel '' the cloud descended and the lily bowd her modest head and went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass ii '' o little cloud '' the virgin said `` i charge thee tell to me why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away then we shall seek thee but not find ah thel is like to thee i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice '' the cloud then shew 'd his golden head his bright form emerg 'd hovering and glittering on the air before the face of thel `` o virgin know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs where luvah doth renew his horses look'st thou on my youth and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more nothing remains o maid i tell thee when i pass away it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair eyed dew to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun till we arise link 'd in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers '' `` dost thou o little cloud i fear that i am not like thee for i walk through the vales of har and smell the sweetest flowers but i feed not the little flowers i hear the warbling birds but i feed not the warbling birds they fly and seek their food but thel delights in these no more because i fade away and all shall say 'without a use this shining woman liv 'd or did she only live to be at death the food of worms '' the cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer 'd thus '' then if thou art the food of worms o virgin of the skies how great thy use how great thy blessing every thing that lives lives not alone nor for itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice come forth worm of the silent valley to thy pensive queen '' the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lily 's leaf and the bright cloud saild on to find his partner in the vale iii then thel astonish 'd view 'd the worm upon its dewy bed `` art thou a worm image of weakness art thou but a worm i see thee like an infant wrapped in the lily 's leaf ah weep not little voice thou can'st not speak but thou can'st weep is this a worm i see thee lay helpless naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother 's smiles '' the clod of clay heard the worm 's voice raisd her pitying head she bow 'd over the weeping infant and her life exhal'd in milky fondness then on thel she fix 'd her humble eyes `` o beauty of the vales of har we live not for ourselves thou seest me the meanest thing and so i am indeed my bosom of itself is cold and of itself is dark but he that loves the lowly pours his oil upon my head and kisses me and binds his nuptial bands around my breast and says 'thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away but how this is sweet maid i know not and i can not know i ponder and i can not ponder yet i live and love '' the daughter of beauty wip 'd her pitying tears with her white veil and said `` alas i knew not this and therefore did i weep that god would love a worm i knew and punish the evil foot that wilful bruis 'd its helpless form but that he cherish 'd it with milk and oil i never knew and therefore did i weep and i complaind in the mild air because i fade away and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot '' `` queen of the vales '' the matron clay answered `` i heard thy sighs and all thy moans flew o'er my roof but i have call 'd them down wilt thou o queen enter my house 't is given thee to enter and to return fear nothing enter with thy virgin feet '' iv the eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar thel enter 'd in saw the secrets of the land unknown she saw the couches of the dead where the fibrous roots of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists a land of sorrows of tears where never smile was seen she wanderd in the land of clouds thro valleys dark listning dolours lamentations waiting oft beside a dewy grave she stood in silence listning to the voices of the ground till to her own grave plot she came there she sat down and heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit '' why can not the ear be closed to its own destruction or the glistning eye to the poison of a smile why are eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie or an eye of gifts graces show'ring fruits and coined gold why a tongue impress 'd with honey from every wind why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in why a nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire '' the virgin started from her seat with a shriek fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of har
a dinner party coffee tea sandwich or supper all may be in their way pleasant but to me not one of these deserves the praise that welcomer of new-born days a breakfast merits ever giving cheerful notice we are living another day refreshed by sleep when its festival we keep now although i would not slight those kindly words we use ‘ good night ’ yet parting words are words of sorrow and may not vie with sweet ‘ good morrow ’ with which again our friends we greet when in the breakfast-room we meet at the social table round listening to the lively sound of those notes which never tire of urn or kettle on the fire sleepy robert never hears or urn or kettle he appears when all have finished one by one dropping off and breakfast done yet has he too his own pleasure his breakfast hour ’ s his hour of leisure and left alone he reads or muses or else in idle mood he uses to sit and watch the venturous fly where the sugar ’ s piled high clambering o ’ er the lumps so white rocky cliffs of sweet delight
the bridge barely curved that connects the terrible with the tender —rilke 1 the children play at the luxembourg fountain their small ships catch wind and sail out and come round again 2 sometime between 250 and 200 b.c fishermen and boatmen of the tribe parisii discovered and built their huts on the largest island in the river seine celtic lutetia “ town surround- ed by water ” thus was born there the island is shaped like a boat— and this figure became a part of the capital ’ s coat-of-arms so this was the start of the city first named for its engulfing water on whose economy it depended then after the people themselves members of the tribe of paris we listen to these water folk and know they hear us for we are born out of boats and out of water the first sound we hear is the heart knocking quiet as a boat docks and we all dissolve to island earth and tears later 3 and into air and fire once in the latin quarter in a space formed for him by waves of bright loiterers near the shortest street named for the cat who catches fish— or who with slight inflection “ sins ” — i watched a dark young man naked to his thin waist push long plumes of flame into the air above our awed faces raised there from the sharp heat inside and out his head and chest glowed in the night with an aura of oil or sweat thirsting he drank again from a sponge of kerosene and breathed out long strings of fire and smoke into the street of the harp dark ash dropped back upon his face and cap which lay open on the cobbled road waiting for coins from all who guessed at the mystery in what he ’ d done he built a vast pillar of fire as if to guide us then suddenly stopped walked across the space and kissed a reaching child to bless and heal that amazed head waved gratefully to us who now filled his cap with alms and smiling and burned i saw scars beneath his raised arm he sailed up that narrowing street in a wildly bal- looning white shirt we had watched him casually don to cover his vestment of skin 4 for centuries that old city ended its west boundary in a small archipelago separated from the main island by the seine ’ s two arms it was on one of these small islets that philip the fair about the year 1314 had raised up a stake for the grand master order of templars whom he condemned then from the palace window watched him burn these little islands quickened with their ghost victim ’ s screams were joined in the sixteenth century by the decree of henry third and by a great engineering feat faust could envy to the main island of the city this new western tip was given the name of a park “ vert galant ” nickname of henry fourth “ the gay old spark. ” near there i watched in a loud street a white-haired man stand with one foot on the curb the other in the cobbled street and play an old mandolin he was dressed in a black and frayed tuxedo and played with intense passion sadly but this desperate dignified man transformed by his art and by poverty his case kept open for money could not play the mandolin —he just strummed the same chord again and again and again ... 5 it was also philip the fair who created an aristocratic prison air by building the blocks-long gothic conciergerie the best view is from the right bank the slaughter house quay which now is a market for pets you can see the four recently cleaned towers reflect- ed in the seine at the seine in fall beneath the red and gold leaves you see the rust mahogany and beige boats gently jostle together at the shore and wait on the right the crenelated bonbec tower stays bonbec means “ babbler ” for this place was used through the centuries as a torture chamber the right one of the twin towers argent held treasure still the gorgeous horloge tower on the left corner of the ancient building across from the bridge of change houses the giant clock which gave its name to that quay in its field of blue the many great gold fleurs-de-lys and the two life-sized mythical women one with a fascicle of wheat one with a balanced scale raised high in the clock whose silver chime used to toll the hours for the monarch this was melted down in those days when terror struck in this turreted place we have shaved the graceful neck and head of marie antoinette ripped her white ruffled collar wide and wrapped the cuff of rope about her hands behind her back we made her face the casual knitting women and men making fists sitting on steps in the “ may court ” where a fresh tree was placed each spring by the lawyers ’ clerks on her way to the guillotine its blade was heavy as primeval stone she the chemist lavoisier charlotte corday poet and brother andré chénier madame du barry—all 2600 who died having said their last farewells in the women ‘ s courtyard twelve per day underneath the blade and some were disemboweled beside was there sometimes an image of beauty in their minds at the last perhaps on white sands beside the blue-black sea a matched pair of roan horses galloping together in the bright spume riderless or a nude young man and woman lying together touching in a field of flowers 6 nearby on this island the gargoyles of notre dame gawk in ancient horror and some forever gnaw on stone rabbits in the parapets or wail in winged formal misery outside the set limits of the orthodox church— all glory happening within the walls where they squat so hunched so beaked so horrorstruck 7 a wing of the may courtyard where the condemned waited “ monsieur de paris ” as executioners were named now adjoins the building of glass and light with no walls it seems jewel of sainte chapelle its windows of rose and blue gold green yellow purple rising fifty feet its spire piercing the foliate layered many-colored egg of the vault of heaven showering all the primal hues and shadows given— bright as the truth reflected in a drop of fresh blood or the colors of the body ’ s inner organs hid- den before the sure explosion of light that hits them at the moment of violent death —this is a time like that of the sun that once a year just at the dawn of winter solstice lights up an ancient celtic stone grave striking the bones spread on shelves with all the colors of the flesh 8 who can stand these juxtapositions of person and place and time i walk across the bridge of change where i have so often watched by the towers of the conciergerie now water laves a little higher up the stair from the river to the quay hiding some of the steps from me boats nudge at the edge i walk along the boulevard past the great gold and blue corner clock the ornate wrought-iron gate and fence of the place of justice its name changed from the time of kings past the shadow and spire of sainte chapelle i cross the bridge of saint michel into the latin quarter but i do not look for the street of the cat who fishes or the street of the harp i turn right wandering a bit and suddenly as if by chance find myself at this street and here i will wait for it is our street rue gît le coeur here lies the

detroit 1950 because the jobs were there and a man could get rich working on the line the south retreated north to michigan whole families eating crackers and baloney by the side of the road changing drivers to keep moving through corn fields and foreign towns sundown and darkness the moon a prophecy of chrome the stars 10 million headlights of the cars they would build ahead lay a city bright with steel behind the dark fields folded over everything they knew and when they dozed on cramped back seats they dreamed such dreams as the road can make of drifting on a lake or stream or lying down in hay to dream of traveling so that when they woke to a bump a couch a voice saying “ it ’ s your turn ” they were lost to themselves and took a few moments to remember their names mostly behind their backs the locals called them rednecks crackers goddamned rebs strange to be strange in their new neighborhoods to be ethnic with a thick accent and a taste for food the grocers didn ’ t stock— hog jowl and blackeyes turnip greens roasting ears souse-meat— the butcher shrugging the produce man shaking his head sometimes their own voices took them by surprise sounding odd and out of place in the din of a city bus ringing lost in the evening air when they called their children in for supper at work they touched parts of tomorrow next year ’ s models always taking shape and vanishing the present obsolete the past merely a rumor all hours blurring into one continuous moment of finishing a fragment each piece the same piece movements identical endless like a punishment in hell no way out but back to their old lives a future they already knew by heart a few on the road each month in cars they may have helped assemble tokens of their failed success legacies for boys to find years later rusting on some lot banged up but still a dream and fast enough when overhauled to make them feel they could blast straight into tomorrow as they raced their engines at each stoplight and cruised their towns in circles
fit the first the landing '' just the place for a snark '' the bellman cried as he landed his crew with care supporting each man on the top of the tide by a finger entwined in his hair `` just the place for a snark i have said it twice that alone should encourage the crew just the place for a snark i have said it thrice what i tell you three times is true '' the crew was complete it included a boots— a maker of bonnets and hoods— a barrister brought to arrange their disputes— and a broker to value their goods a billiard-marker whose skill was immense might perhaps have won more than his share— but a banker engaged at enormous expense had the whole of their cash in his care there was also a beaver that paced on the deck or would sit making lace in the bow and had often the bellman said saved them from wreck though none of the sailors knew how there was one who was famed for the number of things he forgot when he entered the ship his umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings and the clothes he had bought for the trip he had forty-two boxes all carefully packed with his name painted clearly on each but since he omitted to mention the fact they were all left behind on the beach the loss of his clothes hardly mattered because he had seven coats on when he came with three pair of boots—but the worst of it was he had wholly forgotten his name he would answer to `` hi '' or to any loud cry such as `` fry me '' or `` fritter my wig '' to `` what-you-may-call-um '' or `` what-was-his-name '' but especially `` thing-um-a-jig '' while for those who preferred a more forcible word he had different names from these his intimate friends called him `` candle-ends '' and his enemies `` toasted-cheese '' `` his form is ungainly—his intellect small— '' so the bellman would often remark '' but his courage is perfect and that after all is the thing that one needs with a snark '' he would joke with hænas returning their stare with an impudent wag of the head and he once went a walk paw-in-paw with a bear `` just to keep up its spirits '' he said he came as a baker but owned when too late— and it drove the poor bellman half-mad— he could only bake bride-cake—for which i may state no materials were to be had the last of the crew needs especial remark though he looked an incredible dunce he had just one idea—but that one being `` snark '' the good bellman engaged him at once he came as a butcher but gravely declared when the ship had been sailing a week he could only kill beavers the bellman looked scared and was almost too frightened to speak but at length he explained in a tremulous tone there was only one beaver on board and that was a tame one he had of his own whose death would be deeply deplored the beaver who happened to hear the remark protested with tears in its eyes that not even the rapture of hunting the snark could atone for that dismal surprise it strongly advised that the butcher should be conveyed in a separate ship but the bellman declared that would never agree with the plans he had made for the trip navigation was always a difficult art though with only one ship and one bell and he feared he must really decline for his part undertaking another as well the beaver 's best course was no doubt to procure a second-hand dagger-proof coat— so the baker advised it—and next to insure its life in some office of note this the banker suggested and offered for hire on moderate terms or for sale two excellent policies one against fire and one against damage from hail yet still ever after that sorrowful day whenever the butcher was by the beaver kept looking the opposite way and appeared unaccountably shy fit the second the bellman 's speech the bellman himself they all praised to the skies— such a carriage such ease and such grace such solemnity too one could see he was wise the moment one looked in his face he had bought a large map representing the sea without the least vestige of land and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be a map they could all understand `` what 's the good of mercator 's north poles and equators tropics zones and meridian lines '' so the bellman would cry and the crew would reply `` they are merely conventional signs `` other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes but we 've got our brave captain to thank so the crew would protest `` that he 's bought us the best— a perfect and absolute blank '' this was charming no doubt but they shortly found out that the captain they trusted so well had only one notion for crossing the ocean and that was to tingle his bell he was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave were enough to bewilder a crew when he cried `` steer to starboard but keep her head larboard '' what on earth was the helmsman to do then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes a thing as the bellman remarked that frequently happens in tropical climes when a vessel is so to speak `` snarked '' but the principal failing occurred in the sailing and the bellman perplexed and distressed said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due east that the ship would not travel due west but the danger was past—they had landed at last with their boxes portmanteaus and bags yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view which consisted to chasms and crags the bellman perceived that their spirits were low and repeated in musical tone some jokes he had kept for a season of woe— but the crew would do nothing but groan he served out some grog with a liberal hand and bade them sit down on the beach and they could not but own that their captain looked grand as he stood and delivered his speech `` friends romans and countrymen lend me your ears '' they were all of them fond of quotations so they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers while he served out additional rations `` we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks four weeks to the month you may mark but never as yet 't is your captain who speaks have we caught the least glimpse of a snark `` we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days seven days to the week i allow but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze we have never beheld till now `` come listen my men while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know wheresoever you go the warranted genuine snarks `` let us take them in order the first is the taste which is meagre and hollow but crisp like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist with a flavour of will-o'-the-wisp `` its habit of getting up late you 'll agree that it carries too far when i say that it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea and dines on the following day `` the third is its slowness in taking a jest should you happen to venture on one it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed and it always looks grave at a pun `` the fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines which it constantly carries about and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes— a sentiment open to doubt `` the fifth is ambition it next will be right to describe each particular batch distinguishing those that have feathers and bite from those that have whiskers and scratch `` for although common snarks do no manner of harm yet i feel it my duty to say some are boojums— '' the bellman broke off in alarm for the baker had fainted away fit the third the baker 's tale they roused him with muffins—they roused him with ice— they roused him with mustard and cress— they roused him with jam and judicious advice— they set him conundrums to guess when at length he sat up and was able to speak his sad story he offered to tell and the bellman cried `` silence not even a shriek '' and excitedly tingled his bell there was silence supreme not a shriek not a scream scarcely even a howl or a groan as the man they called `` ho '' told his story of woe in an antediluvian tone `` my father and mother were honest though poor— '' `` skip all that '' cried the bellman in haste `` if it once becomes dark there 's no chance of a snark— we have hardly a minute to waste '' `` i skip forty years '' said the baker in tears `` and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark `` a dear uncle of mine after whom i was named remarked when i bade him farewell— '' '' oh skip your dear uncle '' the bellman exclaimed as he angrily tingled his bell `` he remarked to me then '' said that mildest of men `` 'if your snark be a snark that is right fetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens and it 's handy for striking a light `` 'you may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care you may hunt it with forks and hope you may threaten its life with a railway-share you may charm it with smiles and soap— '' `` that 's exactly the method '' the bellman bold in a hasty parenthesis cried '' that 's exactly the way i have always been told that the capture of snarks should be tried '' `` 'but oh beamish nephew beware of the day if your snark be a boojum for then you will softly and suddenly vanish away and never be met with again `` it is this it is this that oppresses my soul when i think of my uncle 's last words and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl brimming over with quivering curds `` it is this it is this— '' `` we have had that before '' the bellman indignantly said and the baker replied `` let me say it once more it is this it is this that i dread `` i engage with the snark—every night after dark— in a dreamy delirious fight i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes and i use it for striking a light '' but if ever i meet with a boojum that day in a moment of this i am sure i shall softly and suddenly vanish away— and the notion i can not endure '' fit the fourth the hunting the bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow `` if only you 'd spoken before it 's excessively awkward to mention it now with the snark so to speak at the door `` we should all of us grieve as you well may believe if you never were met with again— but surely my man when the voyage began you might have suggested it then `` it 's excessively awkward to mention it now— as i think i 've already remarked '' and the man they called `` hi '' replied with a sigh `` i informed you the day we embarked `` you may charge me with murder—or want of sense— we are all of us weak at times but the slightest approach to a false pretence was never among my crimes `` i said it in hebrew—i said it in dutch— i said it in german and greek but i wholly forgot and it vexes me much that english is what you speak '' `` 't is a pitiful tale '' said the bellman whose face had grown longer at every word '' but now that you 've stated the whole of your case more debate would be simply absurd `` the rest of my speech '' he explained to his men `` you shall hear when i 've leisure to speak it but the snark is at hand let me tell you again 't is your glorious duty to seek it `` to seek it with thimbles to seek it with care to pursue it with forks and hope to threaten its life with a railway-share to charm it with smiles and soap `` for the snark 's a peculiar creature that won't be caught in a commonplace way do all that you know and try all that you do n't not a chance must be wasted to-day `` for england expects—i forbear to proceed 't is a maxim tremendous but trite and you 'd best be unpacking the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight '' then the banker endorsed a blank check which he crossed and changed his loose silver for notes the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair and shook the dust out of his coats the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade— each working the grindstone in turn but the beaver went on making lace and displayed no interest in the concern though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride and vainly proceeded to cite a number of cases in which making laces had been proved an infringement of right the maker of bonnets ferociously planned a novel arrangement of bows while the billiard-marker with quivering hand was chalking the tip of his nose but the butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine with yellow kid gloves and a ruff— said he felt it exactly like going to dine which the bellman declared was all `` stuff '' `` introduce me now there 's a good fellow '' he said `` if we happen to meet it together '' and the bellman sagaciously nodding his head said `` that must depend on the weather '' the beaver went simply galumphing about at seeing the butcher so shy and even the baker though stupid and stout made an effort to wink with one eye `` be a man '' said the bellman in wrath as he heard the butcher beginning to sob `` should we meet with a jubjub that desperate bird we shall need all our strength for the job '' fit the fifth the beaver 's lesson they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with a railway-share they charmed it with smiles and soap then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan for making a separate sally and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man a dismal and desolate valley but the very same plan to the beaver occurred it had chosen the very same place yet neither betrayed by a sign or a word the disgust that appeared in his face each thought he was thinking of nothing but `` snark '' and the glorious work of the day and each tried to pretend that he did not remark that the other was going that way but the valley grew narrow and narrower still and the evening got darker and colder till merely from nervousness not from good will they marched along shoulder to shoulder then a scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky and they knew that some danger was near the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail and even the butcher felt queer he thought of his childhood left far far behind— that blissful and innocent state— the sound so exactly recalled to his mind a pencil that squeaks on a slate `` 't is the voice of the jubjub '' he suddenly cried this man that they used to call `` dunce '' `` as the bellman would tell you '' he added with pride `` i have uttered that sentiment once `` 't is the note of the jubjub keep count i entreat you will find i have told it you twice tis the song of the jubjub the proof is complete if only i 've stated it thrice '' the beaver had counted with scrupulous care attending to every word but it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair when the third repetition occurred it felt that in spite of all possible pains it had somehow contrived to lose count and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains by reckoning up the amount `` two added to one—if that could but be done '' it said `` with one 's fingers and thumbs '' recollecting with tears how in earlier years it had taken no pains with its sums `` the thing can be done '' said the butcher `` i think the thing must be done i am sure the thing shall be done bring me paper and ink the best there is time to procure '' the beaver brought paper portfolio pens and ink in unfailing supplies while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens and watched them with wondering eyes so engrossed was the butcher he heeded them not as he wrote with a pen in each hand and explained all the while in a popular style which the beaver could well understand `` taking three as the subject to reason about— a convenient number to state— we add seven and ten and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight `` the result we proceed to divide as you see by nine hundred and ninety and two then subtract seventeen and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true `` the method employed i would gladly explain while i have it so clear in my head if i had but the time and you had but the brain— but much yet remains to be said `` in one moment i 've seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery and without extra charge i will give you at large a lesson in natural history '' in his genial way he proceeded to say forgetting all laws of propriety and that giving instruction without introduction would have caused quite a thrill in society '' as to temper the jubjub 's a desperate bird since it lives in perpetual passion its taste in costume is entirely absurd— it is ages ahead of the fashion '' but it knows any friend it has met once before it never will look at a bribe and in charity-meetings it stands at the door and collects—though it does not subscribe `` its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs some think it keeps best in an ivory jar and some in mahogany kegs '' you boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue you condense it with locusts and tape still keeping one principal object in view— to preserve its symmetrical shape '' the butcher would gladly have talked till next day but he felt that the lesson must end and he wept with delight in attempting to say he considered the beaver his friend while the beaver confessed with affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books would have taught it in seventy years they returned hand-in-hand and the bellman unmanned for a moment with noble emotion said `` this amply repays all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean '' such friends as the beaver and butcher became have seldom if ever been known in winter or summer 't was always the same— you could never meet either alone and when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds quarrels will spite of every endeavour— the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds and cemented their friendship for ever fit the sixth the barrister 's dream they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with a railway-share they charmed it with smiles and soap but the barrister weary of proving in vain that the beaver 's lace-making was wrong fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt on so long he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court where the snark with a glass in its eye dressed in gown bands and wig was defending a pig on the charge of deserting its sty the witnesses proved without error or flaw that the sty was deserted when found and the judge kept explaining the state of the law in a soft under-current of sound the indictment had never been clearly expressed and it seemed that the snark had begun and had spoken three hours before any one guessed what the pig was supposed to have done the jury had each formed a different view long before the indictment was read and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew one word that the others had said `` you must know— '' said the judge but the snark exclaimed `` fudge '' that statute is obsolete quite let me tell you my friends the whole question depends on an ancient manorial right `` in the matter of treason the pig would appear to have aided but scarcely abetted while the charge of insolvency fails it is clear if you grant the plea 'never indebted `` the fact of desertion i will not dispute but its guilt as i trust is removed so far as relates to the costs of this suit by the alibi which has been proved `` my poor client 's fate now depends on your votes '' here the speaker sat down in his place and directed the judge to refer to his notes and briefly to sum up the case but the judge said he never had summed up before so the snark undertook it instead and summed it so well that it came to far more than the witnesses ever had said when the verdict was called for the jury declined as the word was so puzzling to spell but they ventured to hope that the snark would n't mind undertaking that duty as well so the snark found the verdict although as it owned it was spent with the toils of the day when it said the word `` guilty '' the jury all groaned and some of them fainted away then the snark pronounced sentence the judge being quite too nervous to utter a word when it rose to its feet there was silence like night and the fall of a pin might be heard `` transportation for life '' was the sentence it gave `` and then to be fined forty pound '' the jury all cheered though the judge said he feared that the phrase was not legally sound but their wild exultation was suddenly checked when the jailer informed them with tears such a sentence would have not the slightest effect as the pig had been dead for some years the judge left the court looking deeply disgusted but the snark though a little aghast as the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted went bellowing on to the last thus the barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear till he woke to the knell of a furious bell which the bellman rang close at his ear fit the seventh the banker 's fate they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with a railway-share they charmed it with smiles and soap and the banker inspired with a courage so new it was matter for general remark rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view in his zeal to discover the snark but while he was seeking with thimbles and care a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh and grabbed at the banker who shrieked in despair for he knew it was useless to fly he offered large discount—he offered a cheque drawn `` to bearer '' for seven-pounds-ten but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck and grabbed at the banker again without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws went savagely snapping around— he skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped till fainting he fell to the ground the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared led on by that fear-stricken yell and the bellman remarked `` it is just as i feared '' and solemnly tolled on his bell he was black in the face and they scarcely could trace the least likeness to what he had been while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white— a wonderful thing to be seen to the horror of all who were present that day he uprose in full evening dress and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say what his tongue could no longer express down he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair— and chanted in mimsiest tones words whose utter inanity proved his insanity while he rattled a couple of bones `` leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late '' the bellman exclaimed in a fright `` we have lost half the day any further delay and we sha'n't catch a snark before night '' fit the eighth the vanishing they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and hope they threatened its life with a railway-share they charmed it with smiles and soap they shuddered to think that the chase might fail and the beaver excited at last went bounding along on the tip of its tail for the daylight was nearly past `` there is thingumbob shouting '' the bellman said `` he is shouting like mad only hark he is waving his hands he is wagging his head he has certainly found a snark '' they gazed in delight while the butcher exclaimed `` he was always a desperate wag '' they beheld him—their baker—their hero unnamed— on the top of a neighbouring crag erect and sublime for one moment of time in the next that wild figure they saw as if stung by a spasm plunge into a chasm while they waited and listened in awe `` it 's a snark '' was the sound that first came to their ears and seemed almost too good to be true then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers then the ominous words `` it 's a boo— '' then silence some fancied they heard in the air a weary and wandering sigh that sounded like `` -jum '' but the others declare it was only a breeze that went by they hunted till darkness came on but they found not a button or feather or mark by which they could tell that they stood on the ground where the baker had met with the snark in the midst of the word he was trying to say in the midst of his laughter and glee he had softly and suddenly vanished away— for the snark was a boojum you see
when we first heard from blocks away the fog truck ’ s blustery roar we dropped our toys leapt from our meals and scrambled out the door into an evening briefly fuzzy we yearned to be transformed— translated past confining flesh to disembodied spirit we swarmed in thick smoke taking human form before we blurred again turned vague and then invisible in temporary heaven freed of bodies by the fog we laughed we sang we shouted we were our voices nothing else voice was all we wanted the white clouds tumbled down our streets pursued by spellbound children who chased the most distorting clouds ecstatic in the poison
it ’ s the little towns i like with their little mills making ratchets and stanchions elastic web spindles you name it i like them in new england america particularly-providing bad jobs good enough to live on to live in families even kindergarten church suppers beach umbrellas ... the towns are real so fragile in their loneliness a flood could come along and floods have and cut them in two in half there is no mayor the town council ’ s not prepared for this three of the four policemen are stranded on their roofs ... and it doesn ’ t stop raining the mountain is so thick with water parts of it just slide down on the heifers—soggy suicidal— in the pastures below it rains it rains in these towns and because there ’ s no other way your father gets in a rowboat so he can go to work
an etching a meadow brown across the yonder edge a zigzag fence is ambling here a wedge of underbush has cleft its course in twain till where beyond it staggers up again the long grey rails stretch in a broken line their ragged length of rough split forest pine and in their zigzag tottering have reeled in drunken efforts to enclose the field which carries on its breast september born a patch of rustling yellow indian corn beyond its shrivelled tassels perched upon the topmost rail sits joe the settler ’ s son a little semi-savage boy of nine now dozing in the warmth of nature ’ s wine his face the sun has tampered with and wrought by heated kisses mischief and has brought some vagrant freckles while from here and there a few wild locks of vagabond brown hair escape the old straw hat the sun looks through and blinks to meet his irish eyes of blue barefooted innocent of coat or vest his grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest both hardy hands within their usual nest— his breeches pockets — so he waits to rest his little fingers somewhat tired and worn that all day long were husking indian corn his drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound with lazy yawns he slips towards the ground then with an idle whistle lifts his load and shambles home along the country road that stretches on fringed out with stumps and weeds and finally unto the backwoods leads where forests wait with giant trunk and bough the axe of pioneer the settler ’ s plough
very soon the yankee teachers came down and set up school but oh how the rebs did hate it — it was agin ’ their rule our masters always tried to hide book learning from our eyes knowledge did ’ nt agree with slavery— ’ twould make us all too wise but some of us would try to steal a little from the book and put the words together and learn by hook or crook i remember uncle caldwell who took pot liquor fat and greased the pages of his book and hid it in his hat and had his master ever seen the leaves upon his head he ’ d have thought them greasy papers but nothing to be read and there was mr. turner ’ s ben who heard the children spell and picked the words right up by heart and learned to read ’ em well well the northern folks kept sending the yankee teachers down and they stood right up and helped us though rebs did sneer and frown and i longed to read my bible for precious words it said but when i begun to learn it folks just shook their heads and said there is no use trying oh chloe you ’ re too late but as i was rising sixty i had no time to wait so i got a pair of glasses and straight to work i went and never stopped till i could read the hymns and testament then i got a little cabin a place to call my own— and i felt independent as the queen upon her throne
i did not have exactly a way of life but the bee amazed me and the wind ’ s plenty was almost believable hearing a magpie laugh through a ghost town in wyoming saying hello in cambridge eating cheese by the frothy rhine leaning from plexiglass over tokyo i was not able to make one life of all the presences i haunted still the bee amazed me and i did not care to call accounts from the wind once only at pompeii i fell into a sleep i understood and woke to find i had not lost my way
who has not waked to list the busy sounds of summer ’ s morning in the sultry smoke of noisy london on the pavement hot the sooty chimney-boy with dingy face and tattered covering shrilly bawls his trade rousing the sleepy housemaid at the door the milk-pail rattles and the tinkling bell proclaims the dustman ’ s office while the street is lost in clouds impervious now begins the din of hackney-coaches waggons carts while tinmen ’ s shops and noisy trunk-makers knife-grinders coopers squeaking cork-cutters fruit-barrows and the hunger-giving cries of vegetable-vendors fill the air now every shop displays its varied trade and the fresh-sprinkled pavement cools the feet of early walkers at the private door the ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop annoying the smart ’ prentice or neat girl tripping with band-box lightly now the sun darts burning splendor on the glittering pane save where the canvas awning throws a shade on the gay merchandise now spruce and trim in shops where beauty smiles with industry sits the smart damsel while the passenger peeps through the window watching every charm now pastry dainties catch the eye minute of humming insects while the limy snare waits to enthrall them now the lamp-lighter mounts the tall ladder nimbly venturous to trim the half-filled lamps while at his feet the pot-boy yells discordant all along the sultry pavement the old-clothes-man cries in tone monotonous while sidelong views the area for his traffic now the bag is slyly opened and the half-worn suit sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base domestic spoiler for one half its worth sinks in the green abyss the porter now bears his huge load along the burning way and the poor poet wakes from busy dreams to paint the summer morning

december 1789 when infant reason first exerts her sway and new-formed thoughts their earliest charms display then let the growing race employ your care then guard their opening minds from folly ’ s snare correct the rising passions of their youth teach them each serious each important truth plant heavenly virtue in the tender breast destroy each vice that might its growth molest point out betimes the course they should pursue then with redoubled pleasure shall you view their reason strengthen as their years increase their virtue ripen and their follies cease like corn sown early in the fertile soil the richest harvest shall repay your toil
along ancona ’ s hills the shimmering heat a tropic tide of air with ebb and flow bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow like flashing seas of green which toss and beat around the vines the poppies lithe and fleet seem running fiery torchmen to and fro to mark the shore the farmer does not know that they are there he walks with heavy feet counting the bread and wine by autumn ’ s gain but i —i smile to think that days remain perhaps to me in which though bread be sweet no more and red wine warm my blood in vain i shall be glad remembering how the fleet lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat

to pass through astonishment and know much too late and because habit makes us strange i find myself searching on a landscape that generates questions beyond its ability to solve that dark post out there might be this poem standing as you would — lead in the 4th grade play — under theater lights and your shadows that petal around you and what should be most memorable isn ’ t so i recall those prolonged moments of silence incongruous and revealing as metaphor most frequently for instance waiting at the bus stop in pai in a midmorning the hue of the roadside guardrails that dot the cliff ’ s side like morse code before leaving with trees those felled ones half-painted white the burnt trunks ... that passed by like the so many phenomena of our days blurred together into a motion at times convincing as a nickelodeon ’ s i waited under the thatched roof of the station with other travelers with each in our common solitude risen around like that haydn piece in the tunnel i descended into on my way out onto broadway from the 1 train some months ago it seemed of hopper star fruit on the ground discolored withering blighted three of the town ’ s strays hobbled by before midday ’ s heat stalled the town like some lost stephano trinculo and their lamed dark sycophant — at least that ’ s what they were for me it wasn ’ t comfort never comfort but something else and when each moment with expectations for more than it can hold leads to the next and soon — as then — expectation fills up the day as does your breath a balloon the day floats with such care and strange hours and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul ... plato wrote — poetry ’ s banisher beauty ’ s guard 2 my hands grow differently used while one hand thumbs pages the other hand steadies open the book it ’

and bug-eaten we crossed paths with a one-legged man — wordless sounds and that permanent wild gaze — crutching down the stairs four hundred as we stopped to catch a break mid-flight our breath would last us a run-through of the temple and in the first hallway — him his phatic calls tics and unwilled smile facing the morning that just passed the sun no longer in front of his propped body but above it the valley overabundant with the real light that stole our day the fog too lifted against my sight we paused having just climbed the hill we agreed to leave our shoes on despite sandals stationed on the stoop and then we turned towards that hall “ let ’ s go ” he ends befriended prayer phaedrus-empty — the driver gases the bus off the parking brakes to idle back out the station the attendants scoop up the wood wedges and clatter the door shut the passengers all shift in the chapter among the deformed and footless zhuangzi ends arguing for the greatest of men a man void of feelings “ the

what crowding thoughts around me wake what marvels in a christmas-cake ah say what strange enchantment dwells enclosed within its odorous cells is there no small magician bound encrusted in its snowy round for magic surely lurks in this a cake that tells of vanished bliss a cake that conjures up to view the early scenes when life was new when memory knew no sorrows past and hope believed in joys that last — mysterious cake whose folds contain life ’ s calendar of bliss and pain that speaks of friends for ever fled and wakes the tears i love to shed oft shall i breathe her cherished name from whose fair hand the offering came for she recalls the artless smile of nymphs that deck my native isle of beauty that we love to trace allied with tender modest grace of those who while abroad they roam retain each charm that gladdens home and whose dear friendships can impart a christmas banquet for the heart

where moonlight angles through the east-west streets down among the old for america tall buildings that changed the streets of other cities circulate elevated trains overhead shrieking and drumming lit by explosions of sparks that harm no one and the shadowed persons walking underneath the erratic waves not of the lake but of noise move through fog sieved by the steel mesh of the supporting structures or through rain that rinses pavements and the el platforms or through new snow that quiets corners moods riveted careers working for others with hands backs machines men built hard towers that part the high air women and men built cooked cleaned delivered typed and filed carried and delivered priced and sold the river and air were filthy in a hundred years builders would migrate north a mile but in these modern times this was all the downtown that was and circling on a round-cornered rectangle of tracks run the trains clockwise and counter veering through or loop-the-loop and out again why even try to list the kinds of places men and women made to make money not enough of them yet too many from slow trains overhead some passengers can still see stone ornaments pilasters lintels carved by grandfathers great uncles and gone second cousins of today—gargoyle heads and curving leaves like memorials for that which was built to be torn down again someday for those who got good wages out of all this building or were broken by it or both yet whose labor preserves a record of labor imagination ambition skill greed folly error cost story so that a time before remains present within the bright careening now

have you been in our wild west country then you have often had to pass its cabins lying like birds ’ nests in the wild green prairie grass have you seen the women forget their wheels as they sat at the door to spin— have you seen the darning fall away from their fingers worn and thin as they asked you news of the villages where they were used to be gay girls at work in the factories with their lovers gone to sea ah have you thought of the bravery that no loud praise provokes— of the tragedies acted in the lives of poor hard-working folks of the little more and the little more of hardship which they press upon their own tired hands to make the toil for the children less and not in vain for many a lad born to rough work and ways strips off his ragged coat and makes men clothe him with their praise

like finding a bar of aluminum wedged in a bull ’ s jaw like discovering in a sea chest a short obsidian head like looking through a padlock and seeing an undeserved dawn as impossible as all these as melancholy and lonely was it to see the green truck that with the punctuality of a sacrament delivered the coal each month on the slope its strained heart would announce itself vociferously at the brink of death and it would stop in front of the house as if to deliver the agonizing news of the fall of troy and then a man wrapped in sacking would pitch his cargo resonant and angular into an orange-painted crate like opening a bible and finding three leaves of laurel like lifting a stone and remembering someone ’ s name like finding the same snail again a hundred miles away as impossible as all these as melancholy and lonely would it be to find fifteen years later the same coal deliveryman carrying on his trade bent from the strain determined to show the heavens that a man might do that job his entire life that he scraped in the mines that he stole thread from his wife to sew his sacking that he dreamed of infinite excavations of tunnels and that they might forgive him for not having done more than that

i like to see doctors cough what kind of human being would grab all your money just when you 're down i 'm not saying they enjoy this '' sorry mr. rodriguez that 's it no hope you might as well hand over your wallet '' hell no they 'd rather be playing golf and swapping jokes about our feet some of them smoke marijuana and are alcoholics and their moral turpitude is famous who gets to see most sex organs in the world not poets with the hours they keep they need drugs more than anyone germ city there 's no hope looking down those fire-engine throats they 're bound to get sick themselves sometime and i happen to be there myself in a high fever taking my plastic medicine seriously with the doctors who are dying
the flowers i planted along my road have lasted long despite winds and cold already fiery noons begin to burn slyly the secret of the roots and i know that of my footsteps nothing will remain but a trace a cluster a drop to recall along the paths i ’ ve chosen those evening when the light sang in eyes hands hearts and goblets i love the sweet harshness on the tongue filling the palate with a promised saliva knocking the mute keyboard of the teeth with raised draperies of which one might say that memory retains a fleeting trail of them half-glimpsed we won ’ t know how or else the loud reminder of the single moment all gravity banished the unconscious pleasure recaptured of being nothing but entirely animal for our life closed on that iridescent sphere —color taste perfume at their extreme limits—invokes some miracle independent of its origin produced by distilling air and earth— like the move toward technological planets after a calculation made on the fingers of one hand— time contained flowing—continual autumn this evening this wine that enters me to make my head light my tongue loose my cock happy
the artichoke she bore only the heart worked at the stem with her fingers pulling it to her and into her like a cord she would sustain him would cover his heart the hairy needles and the bigger leaves these she licked into shape tipping each with its point he is the mud-flower the thorny hugger the asparagus she sent packs of great beasts to pass over him trailing belly-fur and dust bending their nostrils to his frail spear this was to toughen him for what stupidly like a squirrel standing up looking here and there looking to all sides he is cut down and taken away she can smell him steaming his crowns already tender his spine giving in now he is threatening to wither terribly and slip from the water altogether and billow through the kitchen like prayer the cauliflower her words clot in his head he presses himself to remember and feels the skin peel back the skull bleach crack fall away all that 's left of him is the brain its tissue knotting up to shade him the pain of its light pulsing how to move how to move herbs before fog leaves the scrub-oak or the grasses of the downland take dragonwort under the black alder take cockspur grass and henbane the belladonna the deadly nightshade free them as you would a spider 's web singing over them out little wen out little wen sing this into the mouth of the woman corn i am the corn quail what i do is quick you will know only the muffled clucking the scurry the first shiver of feathers and i will be up i will be in your head with no way out wings beating at the air behind your eyes celery the hope with water is that it will conceal nothing that a clearness will follow upon it like the clearness after much rain or the clearness where the air reaches to the river and touches it where the rain falls from the trees into the river bell pepper to find enough rooms for the gathering the walls go on alone not waiting for corners but thinking of sleeves and how the wind fills them and the snow fills them and how cold it is without fires when there are not enough rooms potatoes it had been growing in her like vegetables she was going into the ground where it could do better where she could have potatoes they would be small and easily mistaken for stones it would fall to her to sort them out persuade them to stay close to her comforting her letting her wear them on her body in her hair helping her hold always very still
although it is a cold evening down by one of the fishhouses an old man sits netting his net in the gloaming almost invisible a dark purple-brown and his shuttle worn and polished the air smells so strong of codfish it makes one ’ s nose run and one ’ s eyes water the five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs and narrow cleated gangplanks slant up to storerooms in the gables for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on all is silver the heavy surface of the sea swelling slowly as if considering spilling over is opaque but the silver of the benches the lobster pots and masts scattered among the wild jagged rocks is of an apparent translucence like the small old buildings with an emerald moss growing on their shoreward walls the big fish tubs are completely lined with layers of beautiful herring scales and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered with creamy iridescent coats of mail with small iridescent flies crawling on them up on the little slope behind the houses set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass is an ancient wooden capstan cracked with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains like dried blood where the ironwork has rusted the old man accepts a lucky strike he was a friend of my grandfather we talk of the decline in the population and of codfish and herring while he waits for a herring boat to come in there are sequins on his vest and on his thumb he has scraped the scales the principal beauty from unnumbered fish with that black old knife the blade of which is almost worn away down at the water ’ s edge at the place where they haul up the boats up the long ramp descending into the water thin silver tree trunks are laid horizontally across the gray stones down and down at intervals of four or five feet cold dark deep and absolutely clear element bearable to no mortal to fish and to seals one seal particularly i have seen here evening after evening he was curious about me he was interested in music like me a believer in total immersion so i used to sing him baptist hymns i also sang “ a mighty fortress is our god. ” he stood up in the water and regarded me steadily moving his head a little then he would disappear then suddenly emerge almost in the same spot with a sort of shrug as if it were against his better judgment cold dark deep and absolutely clear the clear gray icy water back behind us the dignified tall firs begin bluish associating with their shadows a million christmas trees stand waiting for christmas the water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones i have seen it over and over the same sea the same slightly indifferently swinging above the stones icily free above the stones above the stones and then the world if you should dip your hand in your wrist would ache immediately your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn as if the water were a transmutation of fire that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame if you tasted it it would first taste bitter then briny then surely burn your tongue it is like what we imagine knowledge to be dark salt clear moving utterly free drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world derived from the rocky breasts forever flowing and drawn and since our knowledge is historical flowing and flown
i it is not to be bought for a penny in the candy store nor picked from the bushes in the park it may be found perhaps in the ashes on the distant lots among the rusting cans and jimpson weeds if you wish to eat fish freely cucumbers and melons you should have stayed in egypt ii i am alone— and glad to be alone i do not like people who walk about so late who walk slowly after midnight through the

the cold shadow of houses pigeons and sparrows are in a hollow for cold out of the wind but here where the sunshine pours through a narrow street upon a little tree black and naked of every leaf the sparrows are in the sun thick upon the twigs those who in their lives braved the anger of their fellows bronze statues now with outstretched arm or sword brave only the weather i find myself talking aloud as i walk that is bad only don juan would believe i am in conversation with the snow-covered statues only st. francis that i am talking to the sparrows in the naked bushes to the pigeons in the snow vii the ropes in the wind slapping the flag-pole the flag has been hauled down behind the bare tree-tops the lights of an aeroplane moving away slowly a star or two shining between factory

wax unlike a skull they say politely this is you ix i am afraid because of the foolishness i have spoken i must diet on silence strengthen myself with quiet where is the wisdom with which i may be medicined i will walk by myself and cure myself in the sunshine and the wind x i do not believe that david killed goliath it must have been— you will find the name in the list of david ’ s captains but whoever it was he was no fool when he took off the helmet and put down the sword and the spear and the shield and said the weapons you have given me are good but they are not mine i will fight in my own way with a couple of pebbles and a sling xi “ shall i go there ” “ as you like— it will not matter you are not at all important. ” the words stuck to me like burrs the path was hidden under the fallen leaves and here and there the stream was choked where it forced a way the ripples flashed a second she spoke unkindly but it was the truth i shared the sunshine like a leaf a ripple thinking of this sunned myself and for the moment was content xii there is nobody in the street of those who crowded about david to watch me as i dance before the lord alone in my unimportance to do as i like

in the moving train and upstairs in the street the sun is shining as it shines in june xx poet with whiskey bottle and sailor there is anguish there certainly and a commotion in the next room shouts of words and phrases that do not make sentences and sentences that do not make sense i open the door ah the hallway is crowded— descendants of the three wise men now male and female come again to

with open books before them— and never turn a page come merely for warmth not light xxiv a row of tenements windows boarded up an empty factory windows broken a hillside of dead leaves dead weeds old

between the woods you heard me turned your pointed head and we took a long look at each other fox and man then without any hurry you went into the ferns and left the road to the automobiles and me— to

my first week in cambridge a car full of white boys tried to run me off the road and spit through the window open to ask directions i was always asking directions and always driving to an armenian market in watertown to buy figs and string cheese apricots dark spices and olives from barrels tubes of paste with unreadable arabic labels i ate stuffed grape leaves and watched my lips swell in the mirror the floors of my apartment would never come clean whenever i saw other colored people in bookshops or museums or cafeterias i ’ d gasp smile shyly but they ’ d disappear before i spoke what would i have said to them come with me take me home are you my mother no i sat alone in countless chinese restaurants eating almond cookies sipping tea with spoons and spoons of sugar popcorn and coffee was dinner when i fainted from migraine in the grocery store a portuguese man above me mouthed “ no breakfast. ” he gave me orange juice and chocolate bars the color red sprang into relief singing wagner ’ s walküre entire tribes gyrated and drummed in my head i learned the samba from a brazilian man so tiny so festooned with glitter i was certain that he slept inside a filigreed fabergé egg no one at the door no salesmen mormons meter readers exterminators no harriet tubman no one red notes sounding in a grey trolley town

the first time i ever heard about coyotes was in a book called in japanese seton ’ s animals for boys and girls there i encountered lobo the wolf king bighorn sheep a family of wild boars cottontail rabbits and raccoons but it was the stories of the wise coyote i loved the best i read the book over and over over and over it taught me the wisdom of rabbits wolves wild boars but nothing surpassed the wisdom of the coyote tito was raised by humans was kept constantly on a leash no one loved her they teased her until she ran away she learned to survive ran for her life with her pups in her mouth trying to get away from dogs and people i read about her over and over over and over there was a map of america in the front of the book with pictures of animals where the stories took place coyotes in the central plains wolves in the southwest and north elsewhere there were cottontails boars and partridges during my childhood that was america to me where did that book go i no longer live in my childhood home not even in the same town not even in the same country i lost my place there i lost people and relationships almost lost others too i lost my language but what about that book i read over and over over and over i must have lost it too just the other day i tried searching for it on amazon it popped right up and i ordered it straight away lives of the hunted it ’ s called in english published in 1901 reprinted in 1967 it arrived at my home a former library copy the word discard stamped on it in big letters probably the library didn ’ t want it because the stories are too cruel too cruel for today ’ s youth nowadays kids are used to killing one another in the virtual world but even so the stories are too cruel a mother coyote was giving her cubs her milk was licking them when hunters shot her dead her cubs fled into their den only to be dragged out one by one here is how the book describes it even at this age there was a certain individuality of character among the puppies some of them squealed and some of them growled when dragged out to die one or two tried to bite the one that had been slowest to comprehend the danger had been the last to retreat and so was on top of the pile and therefore the first killed the one that had first realized the peril had retreated first and now crouched at the bottom of the pile coolly and remorselessly the others were killed one by one and then this prudent little puppy was seen to be the last of the family it lay perfectly still even when touched its eyes being half closed as guided by instinct it tried to “ play possum. ” one of the men picked it up it neither squealed nor resisted neither squealed nor resisted ... the book was in english but i could read it quickly since i remembered the japanese i had read the book over and over over and over all the coyote pups were killed only one survived only a single pup tossed with its dead littermates into a sack and taken to a farm in the original the hunters named her tito that ’ s what i had suspected i had read it in an old translation kids in japan back then couldn ’ t be expected to pronounce the unfamiliar sound ti but that ’ s the version i was brought up on so for me her name was always chito i was always chito wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w i remember her voice when i was a child i read the book over and over over and over here is how the book describes it an inborn hankering to sing her songs were a volley of short barks mixed with doleful squalls — wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w here is how the book describes it when the sun went down she would feel the impulse to sing that wild song of the west which means so much to the coyotes it is not the invention of an individual nor of the present but was slowly built out of the feelings of all coyotes in all ages i ’ m not sure if i remember the japanese correctly getting old is no fun at all you forget important things like that it is not the invention of an individual nor of the present but was slowly built out of the feelings of all coyotes in all ages and her experiences all emphasized for her that old idea to “ lay low ” — that is to be quiet unobtrusive and hide when danger is in sight those were the most important things i learned as a child chito ’ s wisdom how to survive seeing the book i remembered why i came to this place called america the most important things i learned as a child were in that book i read over and over maybe i had lost them for a while or just forgotten the fate of the animals their lives and deaths their lives upon the plains and my life too chito was killed over and over again but each time she came back to life the humans tenaciously persistently killed her she tricked them and was tricked by them in return she scattered her feces went into heat the more they hunted her the more clearly things came into focus in other words all the things she thought along the way not the invention of an individual nor of the present but slowly built out of the feelings of all coyotes in all ages it was for chito for chito that i abandoned my home bought an airline ticket and came to this place there was someone i barely knew i ’ d only barely caught his scent but still i followed my nose and pursued him i found a room rented a car and stayed the full three months permitted without a visa i thought i ’ d try to stay when people asked me why i ’ d come i said i ’ m a poet i ’ ve come to learn about the oral traditions of the native americans and that was true but i didn ’ t even know what i wanted to know i didn ’ t know where to go i didn ’ t know whom to ask i was terrible at speaking with people in my native tongue so in english it was damn near impossible i couldn ’ t even tell them who i am it took me decades to say that even in japanese but the real reason i came was because i wanted to encounter a coyote i wanted to prick up my ears and listen to its howl rattling dryly over the roads through the darkness of night translated from the japanese

for césar chávez field the wind sprays pale dirt into my mouth the small almost invisible scars on my hands the pores in my throat and elbows have taken in a seed of dirt of their own after a day in the grape fields near rolinda a fine silt washed by sweat has settled into the lines on my wrists and palms already i am becoming the valley a soil that sprouts nothing for any of us wind a dry wind over the valley peeled mountains grain by grain to small slopes loose dirt where red ants tunnel the wind strokes the skulls and spines of cattle to white dust to nothing covers the spiked tracks of beetles of tumbleweed of sparrows that pecked the ground for insects evenings when i am in the yard weeding the wind picks up the breath of my armpits like dust swirls it miles away and drops it on the ear of a rabid dog and i take on another life wind when you got up this morning the sun blazed an hour in the sky a lizard hid under the curled leaves of manzanita and winked its dark lids later the sky grayed and the cold wind you breathed was moving under your skin and already far from the small hives of your lungs stars at dusk the first stars appear not one eager finger points toward them a little later the stars spread with the night and an orange moon rises to lead them like a shepherd toward dawn sun in june the sun is a bonnet of light coming up little by little from behind a skyline of pine the pastures sway with fiddle-neck tassels of foxtail at piedra a couple fish on the river ’ s edge their shadows deep against the water above in the stubbled slopes cows climb down as the heat rises in a mist of blond locusts returning to the valley rain when autumn rains flatten sycamore leaves the tiny volcanos of dirt ants raised around their holes i should be out of work my silverware and stack of plates will go unused like the old my two good slacks will smother under a growth of lint and smell of the old dust that rises when the closet door opens or closes the skin of my belly will tighten like a belt and there will be no reason for pockets harvest east of the sun ’ s slant in the vineyard that never failed a wind crossed my face moving the dust and a portion of my voice a step closer to a new year the sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays and in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me from the thick harvest that was not mine fog if you go to your window you will notice a fog drifting in the sun is no stronger than a flashlight not all the sweaters hung in closets all summer could soak up this mist the fog a mouth nibbling everything to its origin pomegranate trees stolen bicycles the string of lights at a used-car lot a pontiac with scorched valves in fresno the fog is passing the young thief prying a window screen graying my hair that falls and goes unfound my fingerprints slowly growing a fur of dust— one hundred years from now there should be no reason to believe i lived daybreak in this moment when the light starts up in the east and rubs the horizon until it catches fire we enter the fields to hoe row after row among the small flags of onion waving off the dragonflies that ladder the air and tears the onions raise do not begin in your eyes but in ours in the salt blown from one blister into another they begin in knowing you will never waken to bear the hour timed to a heart beat the wind pressing us closer to the ground when the season ends and the onions are unplugged from their sleep we won ’ t forget what you failed to see and nothing will heal under the rain ’ s broken fingers

the scent of pig is faint tonight as the lime trees hang their heads against gradations of blue looking at the lone suitcase in the middle of the farmyard with a sense of solidarity also forgotten its owner never once looked up at them and exclaimed i was still soft-fingered when i planted you in the plane her gaze rests on a flock of cloud-birds pinkish purple with elongated necks rests on the plane ’ s wing-tip colored pink by the sun her head is heavy with this childhood cargo like the hawk that usually flies between or above their branches found skimming the ground with its catch of mouse or mole or the barge that passes every day at four its metal nose just out of the water while empty at eight its sleek sides flash signals to those on shore later on the highway a row of trucks lit like orange squares in the setting sun— a colony of ants each with a piece of chrysanthemum on their backs—begins to reassemble memories the petals become lining the shape of the flower is lost so that years later looking at an old photograph she will not remember the names of cousins and uncles but the exact bend in the river behind them the pattern of trees
we need the ceremony of one another meals served more love more handling of one another with love less casting out of those who are not of our own household ‘ this turkey is either not cooked enough or it ’ s tough. ’ the culture is in late imperial decline the children don ’ t like dark meat or pepper they say the mother sometimes deliberately puts pepper on the things the grown-ups like better less casting out of those in our own household with whom we disagree the cat will not hear of cat food he waves it away he has seen the big thrush taken from the cold box dressed and put in the hot ‘ if i set the alarm clock will you turn on the oven when it goes off ’ then she went off to see the profane dancers of the afternoon it was done the fact that i don ’ t like his pictures should not obscure the facts that he is a good man that many admire his work his canvases threaten my existence and i hope mine his the intolerant bastard that we are brothers in humanity the art often it does though the cat has followed hazard from his studio he looks mean he upbraids the innocent dog and all of us he casts us out ‘ there ’ s pepper in this gravy we ’ re supposed to eat dry turkey and you ’ ve put pepper in the gravy. ’ the meal is served nevertheless with felt love some godless benediction the grown ones have wine after the other bottle they cast out a lot ‘ the dancers this afternoon were well thinky ’ she says she toys with her glass ‘ he is strictly a one-joke painter ’ he replies ‘ painted that one twenty years ago and is still putting pepper on it ha hah finish your turkey you two and leave a little gravy for someone else. ’ the cat is taking notes against his own household he watches hazard would like once to see things with the cat ’ s eyes flat now it is time to go to bed hungry and alone most go to bed in this decline and in all others yet someone has fed us again and blessed us with the manners of bohemia among barbarians a lot is expected of us ceremony-wise we rise to that expectation
his father carved umbrella handles but when umbrella handles were made by machinery there was only one man for whom his father could work the pay was small though it had once been a good trade they lived in the poorest part of the ghetto near the lots where people dump ashes his father was anxious that his son should stay at school and get out of the mess he himself was in “ learning is the best merchandise ” he would say his father died there was his mother to be taken care of he taught in a school in the ghetto some pupils came at nine and stayed until three others came after public school and stayed until evening most of the pupils came in the evening the courses were crammed lasting a few months pupils and teachers anxious to be rid of the matter as soon as possible so he worked day and night week-days and sunday his mother was dead it was cold in the street and windy a dry snow had fallen and the feet of the walkers were turning it into brown sand he was forty now he was free to do what he knew no one whom he cared to marry and who would go into his poverty if he were to give up this work he knew so well to what else could he turn he would just keep on he had lost this world and knew there was no other

heading off beyond the crazies and the little belts north it strikes the river at the gates the water piling through its broad course level ridges and the vertical faces of bluffs crowding to each side this rock is of an excellent grit for whetstones hard and sharp there is here more timber than below the falls a spring immensely clear and of a bluish cast boils up near its center with such force that its surface in that part is strangely higher than the surrounding earth i heard today a noise resembling the discharge of a piece of ordnance unless it be the bursting of the rich mines of silver in these mountains i am at a loss to account for it as the passages about the falls are narrow and steep and as the buffalo travel to the river in great herds the hinder part presses those in front out of their depth to the strong current their carcasses by the hundreds litter the shore below the cataracts we have made of the mast of the pirogue two axletrees walked ahead to my first view of the falls hearing them from afar their spray is scarcely formed when bodies of the same beaten water thrust over and down concealing every shape their whiteness alone visible we will leave at this place all heavy baggage the red pirogue and whatever provisions we can do without needing a cellar for the caching of our stores we set hands to digging more white bear these fellows leave a formidable impression in the mud or sand goodrich who is remarkably fond of fishing caught many trout of two different species came to in a handsome timbered bottom across from the entrance of a very considerable river its character is so precisely that of the one below that the party with few exceptions has pronounced it the missouri the fork to the south is perfectly transparent runs rapidly with an even unriffled surface its bed is composed of round smooth stones like those of rivers issuing from a mountainous country if this latter be the one we are to take we should encounter within 50 miles a series of precipitous falls there is now no timber on the hills the black rock has given place to a yellow and brown or black clay brown and yellowish white sandstone and a hard dark freestone it rises from the water abruptly on both sides in varied walls i could discover above their horizon only the most elevated points the river retains both its whitish color and a proportion of its sediment but it is much clearer than below the banks afforded us good towing this method of ascending the river is the safest and most expeditious we pass a great number of dry streambeds these plains being level and wholly destitute of timber the wind blows violently with its loads of sand driftwood comes down as the water rises the banks are falling in very fast and i wonder that our pirogues are not swallowed by them wild hyssop grows here a few cottonwood along the verges undergrowths of rose and serviceberry and small-leafed willow on the sandbars met this evening the famous white bear i had rather deal with several indians than with this gentleman much less ice running in the river we make ready to set out the party in general good health except for a few venereal complaints a windy blustering day our two pirogues still frozen i draw a connection of the country from the information of traders the falls are about 800 miles west rose early and commenced roofing the two wings of huts our situation sandy cottonwood and elm some small ash we must now settle for the winter very cold hard frosts the river falling for several days we pass deserted mandan villages along both banks the beaver and otter are becoming more abundant we put ashore at noon setting fire to the prairies to signal that we wish council with the natives these arikara much reduced by pox it is customary for their nation to show its grief by pain some cutting off two smaller fingers at the second joint the earth of the plains is in many places opened in long crevices its soil indifferent and with a kind of timothy branching like flax from its main stalk delayed here today so as to take equal altitudes the weights of the waters of the two rivers their specific gravities as we near the great platte the sandbars are more numerous sawyers worse than they were below mulberry oak and walnut these prairies from the river have very much the appearance of farms we continue to pole our way upstream nothwithstanding our precautions we struck a bar and were near turning over the sergeants are directed each to keep a journal of all passing occurrences and such other descriptions of the country as shall seem to them worthy of notice our hunters report deer in every copse i got out and walked for one mile through a rush bottom nettles as high as my breast all the forepart of the day we were arranging our company and taking on those articles we will need st. charles the men spent their last night agreeably dancing with the french ladies c. my ride was on a road finely shaded with now and then a good farm the corn in tassel its leaves of a deep rich green bending at the ends by their own weight wheat and oat stubble a hilly country i passed a toll-gate and looking back had my last view of the town ’ s steeples from the state house cupola i could count the buildings the number of which was ninety a wooden bridge crosses the river just below the town men were engaged in racing their horses i sought lodging and was shown to bed in a large barrack where a man and wife conversed with me until i feigned sleep this is a post town the mails arriving from both east and west on wednesdays and saturdays a young woman gave me directions from an upstairs window i descended the hill into frankfort there has lately been established a large manufactory for spinning hemp and flax it is wrought by water and keeps in motion 1200 spindles the streets of lexington cross at right angles its stores filled both with imports and with local goods fine cutlery tin ware muslins and nankeens i was so well put up that a man would be fastidious to a fault to have found the least thing wanting approaching the city the land changed steadily for the better no longer broken as to the eastward but fine extensive levels and slopes the road very wide with grazing parks meadows and every spot cultivated the farms hereabout have generally good and spacious stone barns a few acres cleared but for those stumps or girdled trees still standing the neighbors found last year a human jawbone rough and honeycombed my wagoner arrived this afternoon and went on appointing to be in louisville before me i pass a house with small turrets at its corners lawns the whole needing only vineyards for the look of villas in provence and languedoc noticed along the banks of the holston phlox with white flowers and phlox with pink flowers two different species very small phlox with lance-shaped leaves where i come in from abingdon the kentucky road divides the other fork for burke courthouse with nothing to do i make ink from gall nuts more opossum taken in the woods this animal ’ s greatest peculiarity is the false belly of the female she can draw the slit so close that one must look narrowly to find it if she be virgin the air clearing this morning i was surprised with a full prospect of mountains this river where we leave off is 240 miles distant in a straight line from currituck inlet the turkey-cocks begin to gobble which is the language wherein they make love we have a dreamer of dreams among us who warned me in the morning to take care that i not fall into the creek i thanked him and used what caution i could but my horse made a false leap and laid me down in the water at my full length the sky at sunset had a swept look there was risk of our dining with st. anthony when one indian knocked down a fat bear of the stem of the silk-grass their women make small aprons which they wear for decency they put these on with so much art that their most negligent postures reveal nothing to our curiosity the ruffles of some of our fellows were a little discolored by the bloodroot which these ladies use to improve their charms bear it would seem is no diet for saints for it is apt to make them too rampant at night the surveyors took advantage of a clear sky this trial of our variance shows it still something less then 3 degrees so it remains much as we had found it at the sea we have now run the poles beyond those inhabitants most inland there fell a sort of scots mist all the way i have learned how rattlesnakes take a squirrel they ogle the poor beast till by force of charm it falls down stupefied and senseless the snake approaches it and moistens first one ear and then the other with his spittle making the head all slippery when that is done he draws this member into his mouth and after it by casual degrees all the rest of the body i am not so rigid an observer of the sabbath as to allow of no journeys to be taken upon it nor would i care like a certain new england magistrate to order a man to the whipping post for daring to ride for a midwife on the lord ’ s day and yet we found plainly that travelling on the sunday had not thriven with us in the least the rain was enlivened with loud thunder and there is something in the woods that makes this sound more awful the violence of the lightning more visible as the trees are shivered quite to the root this great dismal swamp is the source of five several rivers we run our line to its skirts which begin with dwarf reeds moist uneven ground the season inclining us to aguish distempers we were suffered by the resident to cut up wood for firing drive away the damps at the bottom of the account mankind are great losers by the luxuries of feather beds and warm apartments we perceive our appetites to mend and though we have to drink only what adam had in paradise that stream of life runs cool and peaceably in our veins the days are hard our slumbers sweeten and if ever we dream of women they are kind i delight to see the banks of the inlet adorned with myrtle yet it must be owned that sacred to venus though it be this plant grows commonly in very dirty soil norfolk has most the air of a town of any in virginia there are now riding at her wharves near 20 brigantines the trade hither is engrossed by those saints of new england who every week carry off a pretty deal of tobacco i have found that after my devotions a walk in the garden can do much to fill my heart with clear obedience i repair me there that i might think deeply of the earth and how it will be all too soon my sleeping-place for i am told to fear such things as bring me to ill terms told of those who seek congress with the earth that they shall have her in their time forever that her places sing their love-songs for no man that i am not the suitor whose betrothed awaits him but some unwelcome third with god alone her lover and yet i would look upon such country as will show me nature undressed the strata of the land her lays and beds and all her privacies for my wonder tells me i should be promiscuous should learn by all the laws of bodies and by where they are the joyful news out of the new found world this walk is news its bodies point me always in and out along some newer course there have been divers days together wherein alone i ’ ve watched these flowers buoyed on their stems and holding up the sun just now i catch them thinking on themselves composing from their dark places the least passages for light tendering how they look and how i look on them it comes to me that the world is to the end of it thinking on itself and how its parts gather with one another for their time these are the light and all the forms they show are lords of inns wherein the soul takes rest if i could find it in myself to hide the world within the world then there would be no place to which i could remove it save that brightness wherein all things come to see

the skyscrapers of new york will never know the coolness that comes down on kifisia but when i see the two cypress trees above your familiar church with the paintings of the damned being tortured in fire and brimstone then i recall the two chimneys behind the cedars i used to like so much when i was abroad all through march rheumatism wracked your lovely loins and in summer you went to aidipsos god what a struggle it is for life to keep going as though it were a swollen river passing through the eye of a needle heavy heat till nightfall the stars discharging midges i myself drinking bitter lemonades and still remaining thirsty moon and movies phantoms and the suffocating pestiferous harbour verina life has ruined us along with the attic skies and the intellectuals clambering up their own heads and the landscapes reduced by drought and hunger to posing like young men selling their souls in order to wear a monocle like young girls — sunflowers swallowing their heads so as to become lilies the days go by slowly my own days circulate among the clocks dragging the second hand in tow remember how we used to twist breathless through the alleys so as not to be gutted by the headlights of cars the idea of the world abroad enveloped us and closed us in like a net and we left with a sharp knife hidden within us and you said ‘ harmodios and aristogeiton ’ verina lower your head so that i can see you though even if i were to see you i ’ d want to look beyond what ’ s a man ’ s value what does he want and how will he justify his existence at the second coming ah to find myself on a derelict ship lost in the pacific ocean alone with the sea and the wind alone and without a wireless or strength to fight the elements kokkinaras 5 august 1928

five years have past five summers with the length of five long winters and again i hear these waters rolling from their mountain-springs with a soft inland murmur.—once again do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs that on a wild secluded scene impress thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect the landscape with the quiet of the sky the day is come when i again repose here under this dark sycamore and view these plots of cottage-ground these orchard-tufts which at this season with their unripe fruits are clad in one green hue and lose themselves 'mid groves and copses once again i see these hedge-rows hardly hedge-rows little lines of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms green to the very door and wreaths of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees with some uncertain notice as might seem of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods or of some hermit 's cave where by his fire the hermit sits alone these beauteous forms through a long absence have not been to me as is a landscape to a blind man 's eye but oft in lonely rooms and 'mid the din of towns and cities i have owed to them in hours of weariness sensations sweet felt in the blood and felt along the heart and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration —feelings too of unremembered pleasure such perhaps as have no slight or trivial influence on that best portion of a good man 's life his little nameless unremembered acts of kindness and of love nor less i trust to them i may have owed another gift of aspect more sublime that blessed mood in which the burthen of the mystery in which the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world is lightened —that serene and blessed mood in which the affections gently lead us on — until the breath of this corporeal frame and even the motion of our human blood almost suspended we are laid asleep in body and become a living soul while with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy we see into the life of things if this be but a vain belief yet oh how oft— in darkness and amid the many shapes of joyless daylight when the fretful stir unprofitable and the fever of the world have hung upon the beatings of my heart— how oft in spirit have i turned to thee o sylvan wye thou wanderer thro the woods how often has my spirit turned to thee and now with gleams of half-extinguished thought with many recognitions dim and faint and somewhat of a sad perplexity the picture of the mind revives again while here i stand not only with the sense of present pleasure but with pleasing thoughts that in this moment there is life and food for future years and so i dare to hope though changed no doubt from what i was when first i came among these hills when like a roe i bounded o'er the mountains by the sides of the deep rivers and the lonely streams wherever nature led more like a man flying from something that he dreads than one who sought the thing he loved for nature then the coarser pleasures of my boyish days and their glad animal movements all gone by to me was all in all.—i can not paint what then i was the sounding cataract haunted me like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to me an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied not any interest unborrowed from the eye.—that time is past and all its aching joys are now no more and all its dizzy raptures not for this faint i nor mourn nor murmur other gifts have followed for such loss i would believe abundant recompense for i have learned to look on nature not as in the hour of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes the still sad music of humanity nor harsh nor grating though of ample power to chasten and subdue.—and i have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused whose dwelling is the light of setting suns and the round ocean and the living air and the blue sky and in the mind of man a motion and a spirit that impels all thinking things all objects of all thought and rolls through all things therefore am i still a lover of the meadows and the woods and mountains and of all that we behold from this green earth of all the mighty world of eye and ear —both what they half create and what perceive well pleased to recognise in nature and the language of the sense the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse the guide the guardian of my heart and soul of all my moral being nor perchance if i were not thus taught should i the more suffer my genial spirits to decay for thou art with me here upon the banks of this fair river thou my dearest friend my dear dear friend and in thy voice i catch the language of my former heart and read my former pleasures in the shooting lights of thy wild eyes oh yet a little while may i behold in thee what i was once my dear dear sister and this prayer i make knowing that nature never did betray the heart that loved her 't is her privilege through all the years of this our life to lead from joy to joy for she can so inform the mind that is within us so impress with quietness and beauty and so feed with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men nor greetings where no kindness is nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life shall e'er prevail against us or disturb our cheerful faith that all which we behold is full of blessings therefore let the moon shine on thee in thy solitary walk and let the misty mountain-winds be free to blow against thee and in after years when these wild ecstasies shall be matured into a sober pleasure when thy mind shall be a mansion for all lovely forms thy memory be as a dwelling-place for all sweet sounds and harmonies oh then if solitude or fear or pain or grief should be thy portion with what healing thoughts of tender joy wilt thou remember me and these my exhortations nor perchance— if i should be where i no more can hear thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams of past existence—wilt thou then forget that on the banks of this delightful stream we stood together and that i so long a worshipper of nature hither came unwearied in that service rather say with warmer love—oh with far deeper zeal of holier love nor wilt thou then forget that after many wanderings many years of absence these steep woods and lofty cliffs and this green pastoral landscape were to me more dear both for themselves and for thy sake
nothing worth noting except an andromeda with quadrangular shoots— the boots of the people wet inside they must swim to church thru the floods or be taxed—the blossoms from the bosoms of the leaves fog-thick morning— i see only where i now walk i carry my clarity with me hear where her snow-grave is the you ah you of mourning doves
the mayor of scuttleton burned his nose trying to warm his copper toes he lost his money and spoiled his will by signing his name with an icicle-quill he went bare-headed and held his breath and frightened his grandame most to death he loaded a shovel and tried to shoot and killed the calf in the leg of his boot he melted a snow-bird and formed the habit of dancing jigs with a sad welsh rabbit he lived on taffy and taxed the town and read his newspaper upside down then he sighed and hung his hat on a feather and bade the townspeople come together but the worst of it all was nobody knew what the mayor of scuttleton next would do

so we told him to tell those dudes to meet at the park on a friday night 7 o ’ clock and they would get the surprise of their lives i was working a shift at the grocery store the stiff apron covered in flour and scarred with dirt wet from the spray nozzle a crooked crane in my hand one of us had borrowed an enormous cadillac racially inclusive casting to some hiring kids from the neighborhood to us what i remember was how much i wanted to go it wasn ’ t so much that we were going to beat the shit out of fake roughnecks from the burbs who had no clue what they had coming it was because i wanted to be one of the ants in a swarm all my life i hid in the library reading about greek heroes smiting their enemies my best friend in the bunch was trying to convince me to skip out of work even if it meant getting fired i owed this minimum wage job nothing my paychecks mostly went to my mom anyways this was the critical moment in the hero ’ s journey and you ’ re going to miss it he told me though for sure he did not use those words of course i did not go — not because of cowardice but for the much more boring reason that it did not seem proper for me to break the promise i made when i took this shitty job to be there when i said i would to clean what i would clean break down what i would break down they drove to that park as the dusk broke like a bloody egg over the nearby lake blasting ice cube the entire way his song disparaging koreans seemingly not bothering the one korean in the crew and the suburban boys never even showed up i am guessing they just smoked a bit and shouted over the too loud music and fit back into the warehouse of a car that could carry their stupid boy bodies over the roads a cadillac become pegasus none of our dreams having wings
the couple is traveling up the mountain they have been traveling a long time to get to the mountain they left early with their son who strums sweet songs with his fingers songs his mother sang when she was young singing sweetly like him for all that was yet to come in the morning they saw snow on the mountain waking as if to another country far away from rain on the island of orchids where smoke is indistinguishable from mist rain from stone they wanted to get there before the snow melted before it vanished like a memory they left early leaving the house they had built in the forest the house that had aged with them skin as dry as the logs they threw into evening fires before the son could talk he walked among the trees dreamed where roots lifted as if to let the earth breathe resting to the sounds of his parents pulling clearing dragging the sounds he later understood as what needs tending the boy would climb the ladder to the loft survey the trees and peering through a curtain of leaves proclaim himself ruler of all that he saw his mother and father moved in and out of the mist lumpy shadows lifting rocks carrying water planting heart-shaped flowers speaking wordlessly to each other the boy is alone in the back seat as they drive past the tin-roofed town the market where under blue waves of tarp orchids spray out of buckets bananas hang like tropical chandeliers coffee beans slide down waxy pyramids and vendors fan at the jeweled flies keeping fish on ice his fingers pluck single notes random at first and then combined as if his fingers could find a way to string his thoughts the way the road progressed past the last house the last fern the last tree sparkling fireworks of red blossoms pickup trucks hauling snow speed down the mountain racing to unload the precious cargo for children who will run from tv sets to fall like angels in small fenced yards the man is thinking about another woman as he climbs the slopes into clouds it is all confusion — a whiteout he must negotiate the puny engine unsuitable for the elevation the dangerous road conditions the woman is wondering how she will ever be able to leave him the boy strums the guitar strums and looks out the window they break into sky a blue unimaginable in the dome of the forest the white glare hits their eyes like splintered glass clouds erupt in a thousand directions tumbling below them like a cascade of white water observatories rise above the snow at this hour even though the gigantic lenses are shut someone is watching the stars predicting the trajectory of orbits spinning out of control

passing the shop after school he would look up at the sign and go on glad that his own life had to do with books now at night when he saw the grey in his parents ’ hair and heard their talk of that day ’ s worries and the next lack of orders if orders lack of workers if workers lack of goods if there were workers and goods lack of orders again for the tenth time he said “ i ’ m going in with you there ’ s more money in business. ” his father answered “ since when do you care about money you don ’ t know what kind of a life you ’ re going into— but you have always had your own way. ” he went out selling in the morning he read the arrival of buyers in the times he packed half a dozen samples into a box and went from office to office others like himself sometimes a crowd were waiting to thrust their cards through a partition opening when he ate vexations were forgotten for a while a quarter past eleven was the time to go down the steps to holz ’ s lunch counter he would mount one of the stools the food steaming fragrance just brought from the kitchen would be dumped into the trays of the steam-table hamburger steak mashed potatoes onions and gravy or a knackwurst and sauerkraut after that a pudding with a square of sugar and butter sliding from the top and red fruit juice dripping over the saucer he was growing fat

—was it for this that one the fairest of all rivers lov'd to blend his murmurs with my nurse 's song and from his alder shades and rocky falls and from his fords and shallows sent a voice that flow 'd along my dreams for this didst thou o derwent travelling over the green plains near my 'sweet birthplace didst thou beauteous stream make ceaseless music through the night and day which with its steady cadence tempering our human waywardness compos 'd my thoughts to more than infant softness giving me among the fretful dwellings of mankind a knowledge a dim earnest of the calm that nature breathes among the hills and groves when having left his mountains to the towers of cockermouth that beauteous river came behind my father 's house he pass 'd close by along the margin of our terrace walk he was a playmate whom we dearly lov 'd oh many a time have i a five years child a naked boy in one delightful rill a little mill-race sever 'd from his stream made one long bathing of a summer 's day bask 'd in the sun and plunged and bask 'd again alternate all a summer 's day or cours'd over the sandy fields leaping through groves of yellow grunsel or when crag and hill the woods and distant skiddaw 's lofty height were bronz 'd with a deep radiance stood alone beneath the sky as if i had been born on indian plains and from my mother 's hut had run abroad in wantonness to sport a naked savage in the thunder shower fair seed-time had my soul and i grew up foster 'd alike by beauty and by fear much favour 'd in my birthplace and no less in that beloved vale to which erelong i was transplanted well i call to mind 't was at an early age ere i had seen nine summers when upon the mountain slope the frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd the last autumnal crocus 't was my joy to wander half the night among the cliffs and the smooth hollows where the woodcocks ran along the open turf in thought and wish that time my shoulder all with springes hung i was a fell destroyer on the heights scudding away from snare to snare i plied my anxious visitation hurrying on still hurrying hurrying onward moon and stars were shining o'er my head i was alone and seem 'd to be a trouble to the peace that was among them sometimes it befel in these night-wanderings that a strong desire o'erpower 'd my better reason and the bird which was the captive of another 's toils became my prey and when the deed was done i heard among the solitary hills low breathings coming after me and sounds of undistinguishable motion steps almost as silent as the turf they trod nor less in springtime when on southern banks the shining sun had from his knot of leaves decoy 'd the primrose flower and when the vales and woods were warm was i a plunderer then in the high places on the lonesome peaks where'er among the mountains and the winds the mother bird had built her lodge though mean my object and inglorious yet the end was not ignoble oh when i have hung above the raven 's nest by knots of grass and half-inch fissures in the slippery rock but ill sustain 'd and almost as it seem 'd suspended by the blast which blew amain shouldering the naked crag oh at that time while on the perilous ridge i hung alone with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind blow through my ears the sky seem 'd not a sky of earth and with what motion mov 'd the clouds the mind of man is fram 'd even like the breath and harmony of music there is a dark invisible workmanship that reconciles discordant elements and makes them move in one society ah me that all the terrors all the early miseries regrets vexations lassitudes that all the thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd into my mind should ever have made up the calm existence that is mine when i am worthy of myself praise to the end thanks likewise for the means but i believe that nature oftentimes when she would frame a favor 'd being from his earliest dawn of infancy doth open out the clouds as at the touch of lightning seeking him with gentlest visitation not the less though haply aiming at the self-same end does it delight her sometimes to employ severer interventions ministry more palpable and so she dealt with me one evening surely i was led by her i went alone into a shepherd 's boat a skiff that to a willow tree was tied within a rocky cave its usual home 't was by the shores of patterdale a vale wherein i was a stranger thither come a school-boy traveller at the holidays forth rambled from the village inn alone no sooner had i sight of this small skiff discover 'd thus by unexpected chance than i unloos 'd her tether and embark 'd the moon was up the lake was shining clear among the hoary mountains from the shore i push 'd and struck the oars and struck again in cadence and my little boat mov 'd on even like a man who walks with stately step though bent on speed it was an act of stealth and troubled pleasure not without the voice of mountain-echoes did my boat move on leaving behind her still on either side small circles glittering idly in the moon until they melted all into one track of sparkling light a rocky steep uprose above the cavern of the willow tree and now as suited one who proudly row'd with his best skill i fix 'd a steady view upon the top of that same craggy ridge the bound of the horizon for behind was nothing but the stars and the grey sky she was an elfin pinnace lustily i dipp 'd my oars into the silent lake and as i rose upon the stroke my boat went heaving through the water like a swan when from behind that craggy steep till then the bound of the horizon a huge cliff as if with voluntary power instinct uprear 'd its head i struck and struck again and growing still in stature the huge cliff rose up between me and the stars and still with measur 'd motion like a living thing strode after me with trembling hands i turn 'd and through the silent water stole my way back to the cavern of the willow tree there in her mooring-place i left my bark and through the meadows homeward went with grave and serious thoughts and after i had seen that spectacle for many days my brain work 'd with a dim and undetermin 'd sense of unknown modes of being in my thoughts there was a darkness call it solitude or blank desertion no familiar shapes of hourly objects images of trees of sea or sky no colours of green fields but huge and mighty forms that do not live like living men mov 'd slowly through the mind by day and were the trouble of my dreams wisdom and spirit of the universe thou soul that art the eternity of thought that giv'st to forms and images a breath and everlasting motion not in vain by day or star-light thus from my first dawn of childhood didst thou intertwine for me the passions that build up our human soul not with the mean and vulgar works of man but with high objects with enduring things with life and nature purifying thus the elements of feeling and of thought and sanctifying by such discipline both pain and fear until we recognize a grandeur in the beatings of the heart nor was this fellowship vouchsaf 'd to me with stinted kindness in november days when vapours rolling down the valleys made a lonely scene more lonesome among woods at noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights when by the margin of the trembling lake beneath the gloomy hills i homeward went in solitude such intercourse was mine 'twas mine among the fields both day and night and by the waters all the summer long and in the frosty season when the sun was set and visible for many a mile the cottage windows through the twilight blaz 'd i heeded not the summons —happy time it was indeed for all of us to me it was a time of rapture clear and loud the village clock toll 'd six i wheel 'd about proud and exulting like an untired horse that cares not for its home.—all shod with steel we hiss 'd along the polish 'd ice in games confederate imitative of the chace and woodland pleasures the resounding horn the pack loud bellowing and the hunted hare so through the darkness and the cold we flew and not a voice was idle with the din meanwhile the precipices rang aloud the leafless trees and every icy crag tinkled like iron while the distant hills into the tumult sent an alien sound of melancholy not unnoticed while the stars eastward were sparkling clear and in the west the orange sky of evening died away not seldom from the uproar i retired into a silent bay or sportively glanced sideway leaving the tumultuous throng to cut across the image of a star that gleam 'd upon the ice and oftentimes when we had given our bodies to the wind and all the shadowy banks on either side came sweeping through the darkness spinning still the rapid line of motion then at once have i reclining back upon my heels stopp 'd short yet still the solitary cliffs wheeled by me even as if the earth had roll'd with visible motion her diurnal round behind me did they stretch in solemn train feebler and feebler and i stood and watch'd till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep ye presences of nature in the sky and on the earth ye visions of the hills and souls of lonely places can i think a vulgar hope was yours when ye employ'd such ministry when ye through many a year haunting me thus among my boyish sports on caves and trees upon the woods and hills impress 'd upon all forms the characters of danger or desire and thus did make the surface of the universal earth with triumph and delight and hope and fear work like a sea not uselessly employ 'd i might pursue this theme through every change of exercise and play to which the year did summon us in its delightful round we were a noisy crew the sun in heaven beheld not vales more beautiful than ours nor saw a race in happiness and joy more worthy of the ground where they were sown i would record with no reluctant voice the woods of autumn and their hazel bowers with milk-white clusters hung the rod and line true symbol of the foolishness of hope which with its strong enchantment led us on by rocks and pools shut out from every star all the green summer to forlorn cascades among the windings of the mountain brooks —unfading recollections at this hour the heart is almost mine with which i felt from some hill-top on sunny afternoons the kite high up among the fleecy clouds pull at its rein like an impatient courser or from the meadows sent on gusty days beheld her breast the wind then suddenly dash 'd headlong and rejected by the storm ye lowly cottages in which we dwelt a ministration of your own was yours a sanctity a safeguard and a love can i forget you being as ye were so beautiful among the pleasant fields in which ye stood or can i here forget the plain and seemly countenance with which ye dealt out your plain comforts yet had ye delights and exultations of your own eager and never weary we pursued our home amusements by the warm peat-fire at evening when with pencil and with slate in square divisions parcell 'd out and all with crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er we schemed and puzzled head opposed to head in strife too humble to be named in verse or round the naked table snow-white deal cherry or maple sate in close array and to the combat lu or whist led on thick-ribbed army not as in the world neglected and ungratefully thrown by even for the very service they had wrought but husbanded through many a long campaign uncouth assemblage was it where no few had changed their functions some plebeian cards which fate beyond the promise of their birth had glorified and call 'd to represent the persons of departed potentates oh with what echoes on the board they fell ironic diamonds clubs hearts diamonds spades a congregation piteously akin cheap matter did they give to boyish wit those sooty knaves precipitated down with scoffs and taunts like vulcan out of heaven the paramount ace a moon in her eclipse queens gleaming through their splendour 's last decay and monarchs surly at the wrongs sustain'd by royal visages meanwhile abroad the heavy rain was falling or the frost raged bitterly with keen and silent tooth and interrupting oft the impassion 'd game from esthwaite 's neighbouring lake the splitting ice while it sank down towards the water sent among the meadows and the hills its long and dismal yellings like the noise of wolves when they are howling round the bothnic main nor sedulous as i have been to trace how nature by extrinsic passion first peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand and made me love them may i well forget how other pleasures have been mine and joys of subtler origin how i have felt not seldom even in that tempestuous time those hallow 'd and pure motions of the sense which seem in their simplicity to own an intellectual charm that calm delight which if i err not surely must belong to those first-born affinities that fit our new existence to existing things and in our dawn of being constitute the bond of union betwixt life and joy yes i remember when the changeful earth and twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd the faces of the moving year even then a child i held unconscious intercourse with the eternal beauty drinking in a pure organic pleasure from the lines of curling mist or from the level plain of waters colour 'd by the steady clouds the sands of westmoreland the creeks and bays of cumbria 's rocky limits they can tell how when the sea threw off his evening shade and to the shepherd 's huts beneath the crags did send sweet notice of the rising moon how i have stood to fancies such as these engrafted in the tenderness of thought a stranger linking with the spectacle no conscious memory of a kindred sight and bringing with me no peculiar sense of quietness or peace yet i have stood even while mine eye has mov 'd o'er three long leagues of shining water gathering as it seem 'd through every hair-breadth of that field of light new pleasure like a bee among the flowers thus often in those fits of vulgar joy which through all seasons on a child 's pursuits are prompt attendants 'mid that giddy bliss which like a tempest works along the blood and is forgotten even then i felt gleams like the flashing of a shield the earth and common face of nature spake to me rememberable things sometimes 't is true by chance collisions and quaint accidents like those ill-sorted unions work suppos'd of evil-minded fairies yet not vain nor profitless if haply they impress'd collateral objects and appearances albeit lifeless then and doom 'd to sleep until maturer seasons call 'd them forth to impregnate and to elevate the mind —and if the vulgar joy by its own weight wearied itself out of the memory the scenes which were a witness of that joy remained in their substantial lineaments depicted on the brain and to the eye were visible a daily sight and thus by the impressive discipline of fear by pleasure and repeated happiness so frequently repeated and by force of obscure feelings representative of joys that were forgotten these same scenes so beauteous and majestic in themselves though yet the day was distant did at length become habitually dear and all their hues and forms were by invisible links allied to the affections i began my story early feeling as i fear the weakness of a human love for days disown 'd by memory ere the birth of spring planting my snowdrops among winter snows nor will it seem to thee my friend so prompt in sympathy that i have lengthen 'd out with fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale meanwhile my hope has been that i might fetch invigorating thoughts from former years might fix the wavering balance of my wind and haply meet reproaches too whose power may spur me on in manhood now mature to honorable toil yet should these hopes be vain and thus should neither i be taught to understand myself nor thou to know with better knowledge how the heart was fram'd of him thou lovest need i dread from thee harsh judgments if i am so loth to quit those recollected hours that have the charm of visionary things and lovely forms and sweet sensations that throw back our life and almost make our infancy itself a visible scene on which the sun is shining one end hereby at least hath been attain 'd my mind hath been revived and if this mood desert me not i will forthwith bring down through later years the story of my life the road lies plain before me 't is a theme single and of determined bounds and hence i chuse it rather at this time than work of ampler or more varied argument
thus far o friend have we though leaving much unvisited endeavour 'd to retrace my life through its first years and measured back the way i travell 'd when i first began to love the woods and fields the passion yet was in its birth sustain 'd as might befal by nourishment that came unsought for still from week to week from month to month we liv'd a round of tumult duly were our games prolong 'd in summer till the day-light fail 'd no chair remain 'd before the doors the bench and threshold steps were empty fast asleep the labourer and the old man who had sate a later lingerer yet the revelry continued and the loud uproar at last when all the ground was dark and the huge clouds were edged with twinkling stars to bed we went with weary joints and with a beating mind ah is there one who ever has been young nor needs a monitory voice to tame the pride of virtue and of intellect and is there one the wisest and the best of all mankind who does not sometimes wish for things which can not be who would not give if so he might to duty and to truth the eagerness of infantine desire a tranquillizing spirit presses now on my corporeal frame so wide appears the vacancy between me and those days which yet have such self-presence in my mind that sometimes when i think of them i seem two consciousnesses conscious of myself and of some other being a grey stone of native rock left midway in the square of our small market village was the home and centre of these joys and when return'd after long absence thither i repair 'd i found that it was split and gone to build a smart assembly-room that perk 'd and flar'd with wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground which had been ours but let the fiddle scream and be ye happy yet my friends i know that more than one of you will think with me of those soft starry nights and that old dame from whom the stone was nam 'd who there had sate and watch 'd her table with its huckster 's wares assiduous thro the length of sixty years we ran a boisterous race the year span round with giddy motion but the time approach'd that brought with it a regular desire for calmer pleasures when the beauteous forms of nature were collaterally attach'd to every scheme of holiday delight and every boyish sport less grateful else and languidly pursued when summer came it was the pastime of our afternoons to beat along the plain of windermere with rival oars and the selected bourne was now an island musical with birds that sang for ever now a sister isle beneath the oaks umbrageous covert sown with lillies of the valley like a field and now a third small island where remain'd an old stone table and a moulder 'd cave a hermit 's history in such a race so ended disappointment could be none uneasiness or pain or jealousy we rested in the shade all pleas 'd alike conquer 'd and conqueror thus the pride of strength and the vain-glory of superior skill were interfus 'd with objects which subdu'd and temper 'd them and gradually produc'd a quiet independence of the heart and to my friend who knows me i may add unapprehensive of reproof that hence ensu 'd a diffidence and modesty and i was taught to feel perhaps too much the self-sufficing power of solitude no delicate viands sapp 'd our bodily strength more than we wish 'd we knew the blessing then of vigorous hunger for our daily meals were frugal sabine fare and then exclude a little weekly stipend and we lived through three divisions of the quarter 'd year in pennyless poverty but now to school return 'd from the half-yearly holidays we came with purses more profusely fill 'd allowance which abundantly suffic'd to gratify the palate with repasts more costly than the dame of whom i spake that ancient woman and her board supplied hence inroads into distant vales and long excursions far away among the hills hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground or in the woods or near a river side or by some shady fountain while soft airs among the leaves were stirring and the sun unfelt shone sweetly round us in our joy nor is my aim neglected if i tell how twice in the long length of those half-years we from our funds perhaps with bolder hand drew largely anxious for one day at least to feel the motion of the galloping steed and with the good old inn-keeper in truth on such occasion sometimes we employ'd sly subterfuge for the intended bound of the day 's journey was too distant far for any cautious man a structure famed beyond its neighbourhood the antique walls of that large abbey which within the vale of nightshade to st. mary 's honour built stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch belfry and images and living trees a holy scene along the smooth green turf our horses grazed to more than inland peace left by the sea wind passing overhead though wind of roughest temper trees and towers may in that valley oftentimes be seen both silent and both motionless alike such is the shelter that is there and such the safeguard for repose and quietness our steeds remounted and the summons given with whip and spur we by the chauntry flew in uncouth race and left the cross-legg 'd knight and the stone-abbot and that single wren which one day sang so sweetly in the nave of the old church that though from recent showers the earth was comfortless and touch 'd by faint internal breezes sobbings of the place and respirations from the roofless walls the shuddering ivy dripp 'd large drops yet still so sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird sang to itself that there i could have made my dwelling-place and liv 'd for ever there to hear such music through the walls we flew and down the valley and a circuit made in wantonness of heart through rough and smooth we scamper 'd homeward oh ye rocks and streams and that still spirit of the evening air even in this joyous time i sometimes felt your presence when with slacken 'd step we breath'd along the sides of the steep hills or when lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea we beat with thundering hoofs the level sand upon the eastern shore of windermere above the crescent of a pleasant bay there stood an inn no homely-featured shed brother of the surrounding cottages but 't was a splendid place the door beset with chaises grooms and liveries and within decanters glasses and the blood-red wine in ancient times or ere the hall was built on the large island had this dwelling been more worthy of a poet 's love a hut proud of its one bright fire and sycamore shade but though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed the threshold and large golden characters on the blue-frosted signboard had usurp'd the place of the old lion in contempt and mockery of the rustic painter 's hand yet to this hour the spot to me is dear with all its foolish pomp the garden lay upon a slope surmounted by the plain of a small bowling-green beneath us stood a grove with gleams of water through the trees and over the tree-tops nor did we want refreshment strawberries and mellow cream and there through half an afternoon we play'd on the smooth platform and the shouts we sent made all the mountains ring but ere the fall of night when in our pinnace we return'd over the dusky lake and to the beach of some small island steer 'd our course with one the minstrel of our troop and left him there and row 'd off gently while he blew his flute alone upon the rock oh then the calm and dead still water lay upon my mind even with a weight of pleasure and the sky never before so beautiful sank down into my heart and held me like a dream thus daily were my sympathies enlarged and thus the common range of visible things grew dear to me already i began to love the sun a boy i lov 'd the sun not as i since have lov 'd him as a pledge and surety of our earthly life a light which while we view we feel we are alive but for this cause that i had seen him lay his beauty on the morning hills had seen the western mountain touch his setting orb in many a thoughtless hour when from excess of happiness my blood appear 'd to flow with its own pleasure and i breath 'd with joy and from like feelings humble though intense to patriotic and domestic love analogous the moon to me was dear for i would dream away my purposes standing to look upon her while she hung midway between the hills as if she knew no other region but belong 'd to thee yea appertain 'd by a peculiar right to thee and thy grey huts my darling vale those incidental charms which first attach'd my heart to rural objects day by day grew weaker and i hasten on to tell how nature intervenient till this time and secondary now at length was sought for her own sake but who shall parcel out his intellect by geometric rules split like a province into round and square who knows the individual hour in which his habits were first sown even as a seed who that shall point as with a wand and say 'this portion of the river of my mind came from yon fountain thou my friend art one more deeply read in thy own thoughts to thee science appears but what in truth she is not as our glory and our absolute boast but as a succedaneum and a prop to our infirmity thou art no slave of that false secondary power by which in weakness we create distinctions then deem that our puny boundaries are things which we perceive and not which we have made to thee unblinded by these outward shows the unity of all has been reveal'd and thou wilt doubt with me less aptly skill'd than many are to class the cabinet of their sensations and in voluble phrase run through the history and birth of each as of a single independent thing hard task to analyse a soul in which not only general habits and desires but each most obvious and particular thought not in a mystical and idle sense but in the words of reason deeply weigh 'd hath no beginning bless 'd the infant babe for with my best conjectures i would trace the progress of our being blest the babe nurs 'd in his mother 's arms the babe who sleeps upon his mother 's breast who when his soul claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul doth gather passion from his mother 's eye such feelings pass into his torpid life like an awakening breeze and hence his mind even in the first trial of its powers is prompt and watchful eager to combine in one appearance all the elements and parts of the same object else detach'd and loth to coalesce thus day by day subjected to the discipline of love his organs and recipient faculties are quicken 'd are more vigorous his mind spreads tenacious of the forms which it receives in one beloved presence nay and more in that most apprehensive habitude and those sensations which have been deriv'd from this beloved presence there exists a virtue which irradiates and exalts all objects through all intercourse of sense no outcast he bewilder 'd and depress 'd along his infant veins are interfus'd the gravitation and the filial bond of nature that connect him with the world emphatically such a being lives an inmate of this active universe from nature largely he receives nor so is satisfied but largely gives again for feeling has to him imparted strength and powerful in all sentiments of grief of exultation fear and joy his mind even as an agent of the one great mind creates creator and receiver both working but in alliance with the works which it beholds.—such verily is the first poetic spirit of our human life by uniform control of after years in most abated or suppress 'd in some through every change of growth or of decay pre-eminent till death from early days beginning not long after that first time in which a babe by intercourse of touch i held mute dialogues with my mother 's heart i have endeavour 'd to display the means whereby this infant sensibility great birthright of our being was in me augmented and sustain 'd yet is a path more difficult before me and i fear that in its broken windings we shall need the chamois sinews and the eagle 's wing for now a trouble came into my mind from unknown causes i was left alone seeking the visible world nor knowing why the props of my affections were remov 'd and yet the building stood as if sustain'd by its own spirit all that i beheld was dear to me and from this cause it came that now to nature 's finer influxes my mind lay open to that more exact and intimate communion which our hearts maintain with the minuter properties of objects which already are belov 'd and of those only many are the joys of youth but oh what happiness to live when every hour brings palpable access of knowledge when all knowledge is delight and sorrow is not there the seasons came and every season to my notice brought a store of transitory qualities which but for this most watchful power of love had been neglected left a register of permanent relations else unknown hence life and change and beauty solitude more active even than 'best society society made sweet as solitude by silent inobtrusive sympathies and gentle agitations of the mind from manifold distinctions difference perceived in things where to the common eye no difference is and hence from the same source sublimer joy for i would walk alone in storm and tempest or in starlight nights beneath the quiet heavens and at that time have felt whate'er there is of power in sound to breathe an elevated mood by form or image unprofaned and i would stand beneath some rock listening to sounds that are the ghostly language of the ancient earth or make their dim abode in distant winds thence did i drink the visionary power i deem not profitless those fleeting moods of shadowy exultation not for this that they are kindred to our purer mind and intellectual life but that the soul remembering how she felt but what she felt remembering not retains an obscure sense of possible sublimity to which with growing faculties she doth aspire with faculties still growing feeling still that whatsoever point they gain they still have something to pursue and not alone in grandeur and in tumult but no less in tranquil scenes that universal power and fitness in the latent qualities and essences of things by which the mind is mov 'd by feelings of delight to me came strengthen 'd with a superadded soul a virtue not its own my morning walks were early oft before the hours of school i travell 'd round our little lake five miles of pleasant wandering happy time more dear for this that one was by my side a friend then passionately lov 'd with heart how full will he peruse these lines this page perhaps a blank to other men for many years have since flow 'd in between us and our minds both silent to each other at this time we live as if those hours had never been nor seldom did i lift our cottage latch far earlier and before the vernal thrush was audible among the hills i sate alone upon some jutting eminence at the first hour of morning when the vale lay quiet in an utter solitude how shall i trace the history where seek the origin of what i then have felt oft in these moments such a holy calm did overspread my soul that i forgot that i had bodily eyes and what i saw appear 'd like something in myself a dream a prospect in my mind 'twere long to tell what spring and autumn what the winter snows and what the summer shade what day and night the evening and the morning what my dreams and what my waking thoughts supplied to nurse that spirit of religious love in which i walked with nature but let this at least be not forgotten that i still retain'd my first creative sensibility that by the regular action of the world my soul was unsubdu 'd a plastic power abode with me a forming hand at times rebellious acting in a devious mood a local spirit of its own at war with general tendency but for the most subservient strictly to the external things with which it commun 'd an auxiliar light came from my mind which on the setting sun bestow 'd new splendor the melodious birds the gentle breezes fountains that ran on murmuring so sweetly in themselves obey'd a like dominion and the midnight storm grew darker in the presence of my eye hence by obeisance my devotion hence and hence my transport nor should this perchance pass unrecorded that i still have lov'd the exercise and produce of a toil than analytic industry to me more pleasing and whose character i deem is more poetic as resembling more creative agency i mean to speak of that interminable building rear'd by observation of affinities in objects where no brotherhood exists to common minds my seventeenth year was come and whether from this habit rooted now so deeply in my mind or from excess of the great social principle of life coercing all things into sympathy to unorganic natures i transferr'd my own enjoyments or the power of truth coming in revelation i convers'd with things that really are i at this time saw blessings spread around me like a sea thus did my days pass on and now at length from nature and her overflowing soul i had receiv 'd so much that all my thoughts were steep 'd in feeling i was only then contented when with bliss ineffable i felt the sentiment of being spread o'er all that moves and all that seemeth still o'er all that lost beyond the reach of thought and human knowledge to the human eye invisible yet liveth to the heart o'er all that leaps and runs and shouts and sings or beats the gladsome air o'er all that glides beneath the wave yea in the wave itself and mighty depth of waters wonder not if such my transports were for in all things i saw one life and felt that it was joy one song they sang and it was audible most audible then when the fleshly ear o'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain forgot its functions and slept undisturb 'd if this be error and another faith find easier access to the pious mind yet were i grossly destitute of all those human sentiments which make this earth so dear if i should fail with grateful voice to speak of you ye mountains and ye lakes and sounding cataracts ye mists and winds that dwell among the hills where i was born if in my youth i have been pure in heart if mingling with the world i am content with my own modest pleasures and have liv 'd with god and nature communing remov'd from little enmities and low desires the gift is yours if in these times of fear this melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown if 'mid indifference and apathy and wicked exultation when good men on every side fall off we know not how to selfishness disguis 'd in gentle names of peace and quiet and domestic love yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers on visionary minds if in this time of dereliction and dismay i yet despair not of our nature but retain a more than roman confidence a faith that fails not in all sorrow my support the blessing of my life the gift is yours ye mountains thine o nature thou hast fed my lofty speculations and in thee for this uneasy heart of ours i find a never-failing principle of joy and purest passion thou my friend wert rear'd in the

thou art one the most intense of nature 's worshippers in many things my brother chiefly here in this my deep devotion fare thee well health and the quiet of a healthful mind attend thee seeking oft the haunts of men and yet more often living with thyself and for thyself so haply shall thy days be many and a blessing to mankind

the ship solid and black enters the clear blackness of the great harbor quiet and cold —the people waiting are still asleep dreaming and warm far away and still stretched out in this dream perhaps how real our watch is beside the dream of doubt the others had how sure it is compared to their troubled dream about us quiet silence silence which in breaking up at dawn will speak differently

we stand in the rain in a long line waiting at ford highland park for work you know what work is—if you ’ re old enough to read this you know what work is although you may not do it forget you this is about waiting shifting from one foot to another feeling the light rain falling like mist into your hair blurring your vision until you think you see your own brother ahead of you maybe ten places you rub your glasses with your fingers and of course it ’ s someone else ’ s brother narrower across the shoulders than yours but with the same sad slouch the grin that does not hide the stubbornness the sad refusal to give in to rain to the hours of wasted waiting to the knowledge that somewhere ahead a man is waiting who will say “ no we ’ re not hiring today ” for any reason he wants you love your brother now suddenly you can hardly stand the love flooding you for your brother who ’ s not beside you or behind or ahead because he ’ s home trying to sleep off a miserable night shift at cadillac so he can get up before noon to study his german works eight hours a night so he can sing wagner the opera you hate most the worst music ever invented how long has it been since you told him you loved him held his wide shoulders opened your eyes wide and said those words and maybe kissed his cheek you ’ ve never done something so simple so obvious not because you ’ re too young or too dumb not because you ’ re jealous or even mean or incapable of crying in the presence of another man no just because you don ’ t know what work is
i wish i could find that skinny long-beaked boy who perched in the branches of the old branch library he spent the sabbath flying between the wobbly stacks and the flimsy wooden tables on the second floor pecking at nuts nesting in broken spines scratching notes under his own corner patch of sky i 'd give anything to find that birdy boy again bursting out into the dusky blue afternoon with his satchel of scrawls and scribbles radiating heat singing with joy

i ’ ve always worried about you—the man or woman at the piano bench night after night receiving only such applause as the singer allows a warm hand please for my accompanist at concerts as i watch your fingers on the keys and how swiftly how excellently you turn sheet music pages track the singer ’ s notes cover the singer ’ s flaws i worry about whole lifetimes most lifetimes lived in the shadows of reflected fame but then the singer ’ s voice dies and there are just your last piano notes not resentful at all carrying us to the end into those heartfelt cheers that spring up in little patches from a thrilled audience like sudden wildflowers bobbing in a rain of steady clapping and i ’ m on my feet also clapping and cheering for the singer yes but i think partially likewise for you half-turned toward us balanced on your black bench modest utterly well-rehearsed still playing the part you ’ ve made yours
when the wind clipped the whitecaps and the flags came down before they shredded we knew it was no nor ’ easter the blue nose ferry stayed on course west out of yarmouth while 100 miles of fog on the bay blew away the captain let us stand on the starboard bridge and scan a jagged range shearwaters skimmed the peaks while storm petrels hunted valleys that slowly filled with gold alberto blew out in the atlantic we came back to earth that for days might tip and sway and cast us back to sea
inside the standard lunch hour din they rise four seamless voices fused into one floating somewhere between a low hum and a vibration like the sound of a train rumbling beneath noisy traffic the men are hunched around a booth table a fire circle of coffee cups and loose fists leaning in around the thing they are summoning forth from inside this suddenly beating four-chambered heart i ’ ve taken avery out on a whim ordered quesadillas and onion rings a kiddy milk with three straws we ’ re already deep in the meal extra napkins and wipes for the grease coating our faces and hands like mid-summer sweat and because we ’ re happy lost in the small pleasures of father and son at first their voices seem to come from inside us who ’ s that boy singing avery asks unable to see these men wrapped in their act i let him keep looking rapt and when no one is paying attention i put down my fork and take my boy ’ s hand and together we dive into the song or maybe it pours into us and we ’ re the ones brimming with it
start with the square heavy loaf steamed a whole day in a hot spring until the coarse rye sugar yeast grow dense as a black hole of bread let it age and dry a little then soak the old loaf for a day in warm water flavored with raisins and lemon slices boil it until it is thick as molasses pour it in a flat white bowl ladle a good dollop of whipped cream to melt in its brown belly this soup is alive as any animal and the yeast and cream and rye will sing inside you after eating for a long time
day after day along with his placid automobiles that well-groomed sallow young man had been waiting for me as in the cheerful unchanging weather of a billboard—pacing the tiles patting his tie knotting un- knotting the façade of his smile while staring out the window he was so bad at the job he reminded me of myself the summer i failed at selling time and life in new jersey even though i was a boy i could feel someone else ’ s voice crawl out of my mouth spoiling every word like this cowed polite kid in his tie and badge that said greg saying ma ’ am to my wife calling me sir retailing the air with such piety i had to find anything out the window maybe the rain it was gray and as honestly wet as ever something we could both believe
first we tamp down the ridges that criss-cross the yard then wait for the ground to move again i hold the shoe box you the trowel when i give you the signal you dig in behind and flip forward out he pops into daylight blind velvet we nudge him into the box carry him down the hill four times we ’ ve done it the children worry have we let them all go at the very same spot will they find each other we can ’ t be sure ourselves only just beginning to learn the fragile rules of uprooting
i came to encounter a coyote i left all sorts of things behind you couldn ’ t get on a plane unless you traveled light back then there were weight restrictions for planes they don ’ t have them any longer american bodies have no restrictions they ’ ve become so big that there aren ’ t restrictions on the weight of bodies or luggage any more but back then i can ’ t even count how many times i picked up my bags and stepped on the scale no matter how many times i weighed myself i still wasn ’ t the least bit lighter not knowing what else to do i took out my books then i took out my clothes then i went to the bathroom and defecated then i took out more clothes then i threw up then i took out more books then i stripped off all my clothes held my bag and stood on the scale but i wasn ’ t the least bit lighter know what i mean that ’ s what it means to go on a trip that ’ s what it means to leave the place where you live trips and then more trips there are things you need to carry with you to survive not knowing what else to do i called my husband filed for divorce talked to my children and told them mommy wouldn ’ t be home for a while in other words it was only after i abandoned my relationships my attachments and even my language that i was light enough to get on the plane when i arrived all i had was a few changes of clothes some cash my passport my visa waiver my credit cards and an international driver ’ s license in california the sky was blue there was nothing but seashore wild land and housing developments it was hazy and hard to see in the evenings it was as if everything was immersed in mother ’ s milk my toes got cold i bought some socks but after wearing them three days the cheap things were ready to fall apart i looked long and hard at them feeling like a coyote yeah i tell people i came alone but that is not entirely true i was always thinking about the coyote the two of us traveling together i saw dead raccoons i saw dead skunks i smelled them too someone i met the first day said to me the whole place smells like skunk must be a dead one somewhere it was an unfamiliar scent but now i know it well the whole place smells like skunk must be a dead one somewhere i know to say that to people now in any case i didn ’ t see any coyotes two traveling together someone in the street told me to get the hell out of here why had i come i couldn ’ t find what i wanted i had come so far but get the hell out this isn ’ t the place where the coyotes are they ’ re farther away in deeper places where there is nothing where there is much more emptiness so i headed east from the western edge of the continent to the east the interstates with odd numbers run north and south while even numbers run east and west those in the 500s are the bypasses for i-5 north-south those in the 800s are the bypasses for i-8 east-west i took i-5 south to i-580 i went further south to i-8 then went east east east east and even further east in arizona i took i-17 at flagstaff i took us route 89 i dashed into a roadside motel slept and woke and started driving again the morning light shone brilliantly each time i stopped to fill up with gas i bought some brownies each individually wrapped i tore off the wrappers with one hand and ate them as i drove the ridiculously sweet lumps stuck to the roof of my mouth when i stopped in front of a motel that night my fingers didn ’ t want to leave the steering wheel at the registration desk the words i needed to say in english didn ’ t rise to my lips even though i knew them all too well two traveling together there was a woman standing at the side of the road i called out to her in broken english asking her what was the matter she answered in what was also broken english would you mind taking me to the nearest gas station she sat in the passenger ’ s seat i ’ m navajo where are you from from california i answered no that ’ s not what i meant what tribe are you from she asked two traveling together from kayenta i took us route 163 toward monument valley i had heard that coyotes lived there long ago that it ’ s an amazing place the moon rises the sun sets i imagined it would be like seeing the ocean but when i got there it wasn ’ t like the ocean at all rocks soared into the air rocks rocks even more rocks red rocks in the dust i watched the sun set over them by the time i got back to route 163 the sun had sunk deep beyond the horizon the only thing i could see was the road in front of me i drove on looking for a place to sleep but i didn ’ t see a thing there wasn ’ t anything to see air rushed through my cracked window letting out a long thin high-pitched whistle hii-iuu-uuuuu hii-iuu-uuuuu like a reed flute my thin hard window was slightly open the wind rushed in but couldn ’ t escape hii-iuuu uuu-uuuuu uuu-hiiuuuuu two of us heard it i drove a long way before spying a large motel i saw the vacancy sign as i approached i thought i ’ d have to drive for hours and hours before finding a place to sleep i thought i wouldn ’ t stop that i ’ d drive all night without stopping but the place i found was part of a chain you see in every city the bed was big and deep and there was lots of hot water in the tub two of us were there the next morning the car was completely filthy the whole thing was covered with bright red dirt and sand the windshield was covered with the splattered bodies of countless insects no one knew i had slept there nor that i was leaving nor which direction i was headed no one knew it was a day that invited death along the roadside i hadn ’ t even driven for five minutes before i saw it — a single dead coyote lying on its back legs in the air it was both me and my travel companion too translated from the japanese
i dreamed of you tonight wayne kaumualii westlake as i walked down on the sidewalk under plumeria trees with a vog headache looking at the māhealani moon in my need fo ’ grindz and hungry fo ’ modernity i stumbled into the gentrified lights of whole foods dreaming of your manifestos what pineapples and what papayas busloads of tourists shopping at night bulk aisle full of hippies millennials in the kale settlers in the kona coffee and you richard hamasaki what were you doing kissing the ripe mangos i saw you wayne kaumualii westlake broomless ghostly janitor sampling the poke in the seafood section and eyeing the smoked fish i heard you ask questions of each who butchered the mahimahi what price opah belly are you my ‘ aumakua i wandered in and out of the canned goods aisle following you and followed in my imagination by sir spamalot in our bourgeois fancy we strolled through the cooked foods section tasting hand-churned cheese possessing every imported delicacy and whispering to the cashier “ go fuck yourself. ” where are we going wayne kaumualii westlake the doors of perception close in an hour which way does your pakalōlō point tonight i touch your book and dream of our huaka ‘ i in whole foods and feel dādā will we sail all night through honolulu streets the coconut trees no have nuts tarps up for the homeless we ’ ll both be lonely will we cruise witnessing the ruined empire of america past pink mopeds in driveways home to our overpriced apartments ah dear uncle buddhahead ghostly poetry teacher what hawai ‘ i did you have when thebus quit turning its wheels and you arrived in waikīkī and stood watching the canoes disappear on the murky waters of the ala wai
down at the end of baxter street where five points slum used to be just north of tombs is a pocket park on these summer days the green plane trees ’ leaves linger heavy as a noon mist above the men playing mah jongg—more chinese in the air than english the city ’ s composed of village greens we rely on the thai place on the corner tom kha for a cold jasmine tea for fever squid for love duck yum for loneliness outside the grove of heat narrow streets where people wrestle rash and unseen angels inside the coolness of a glen and the wait staff in their pale blue collars offering ice water whatever you ’ ve done or undone there ’ s a dish for you to take out or eat in spice for courage sweet for chagrin
i can see her in the kitchen cooking up for the hundredth time a little something from her limited midwestern repertoire cigarette going in the ashtray the red wine pulsing in its glass a warning light meaning everything was simmering just below the steel lid of her smile as she boiled the beef into submission chopped her way through the vegetable kingdom with the broken-handled knife i use tonight feeling her anger rising from the dark chambers of the head of cabbage i slice through missing her wanting to chew things over with my mother again
she pays attention to the hair not her fingers and cuts herself once or twice a day doesn ’ t notice anymore just if the blood starts flowing says excuse me to the customer and walks away for a band-aid same spot on the middle finger over and over raised like a callus also the nicks where she snips between her fingers the torn webbing also spider veins on her legs now so ugly though she sits in a chair for half of each cut rolls around from side to side at night in the winter she sleeps in white cotton gloves neosporin on the cuts vitamin e then heavy lotion all night for weeks her white hands lie clothed like those of a young girl going to her first party sleeping alone she opens and closes her long scissors and the hair falls under her hands it ’ s a good living kind of like an undertaker the people keep coming and the hair shoulder length french twist braids someone has to cut it at the end she whisks and talcums my neck only then can i bend and see my hair how it covers the floor curls and clippings of brown and silver how it shines like a field of scythed hay beneath my feet
from my window i watch the roots of a willow push your house crooked women rummage through boxes your sons cart away the tv its cord trailing like your useless arms only weeks ago we watched the heavyweights and between rounds you pummeled the air drank whiskey admonished “ know your competition ” you did kansas the ‘ 20s when you measured the town champ as he danced the same dance over and over left foot right lead head down the move you ’ d dreamt about for days then right on cue your hay-bale uppercut compressed his spine you know that was that now your mail piles up resident circled “ not here. ” your lawn goes to seed dandelions burst in the wind from my window i see you flat on your back on some canvas above you a wrinkled face its clippy bow tie bobbing toward ten there ’ s someone behind you resting easy against the ropes a last minute substitute on the card you knew so well vaguely familiar taken for granted with a sucker punch you don ’ t remember ever having seen
my father scolded us all for refusing his liquor he kept buying tequila and steak for the grill until finally we joined him making margaritas cutting the fat off the bone when he saw how we drank my sister shredding the black labels into her glass while his remaining grandchildren dragged their thin bunk bed mattresses first out to the lawn to play then farther up the field to sleep next to her i think it was then he changed something in him died he 's gentler now quiet losing weight though every night he eats the same ice cream he always ate only now he 's not drinking he does n't fall asleep with the spoon in his hand he waits for my mother to come lie down with him
mouths full of laughter the turistas come to the tall hotel with suitcases full of dollars every morning my brother makes the cool beach new for them with a wooden board he smooths away all footprints i peek through the cactus fence and watch the women rub oil sweeter than honey into their arms and legs while their children jump waves or sip drinks from long straws coconut white mango yellow once my little sister ran barefoot across the hot sand for a taste my mother roared like the ocean “ no no it ’ s their beach it ’ s their beach ”
glory be to god for breaded things— catfish steak finger pork chop chicken thigh sliced green tomatoes pots full to the brim with french fries fritters life-float onion rings hushpuppies okra golden to the eye that in all oils corn or canola swim toward mastication ’ s maw o molared mouth whatever browns is dumped to drain and dry on paper towels ’ sleek translucent scrim these greasy battered bounties of the south eat them
they were smooth ovals and some the shade of potatoes— some had been moth-eaten or spotted the maples were starched and crackled like campfire we put them under tracing paper and rubbed our crayons over them x-raying the spread of their bones and black veined catacombs we colored them green and brown and orange and cut them out along the edges labeling them deciduous or evergreen all day in the stuffy air of the classroom with its cockeyed globe and nautical maps of ocean floors i watched those leaves lost in their own worlds flap on the pins of the bulletin boards without branches or roots or even a sky to hold on to
there is this tea i have sometimes pan long ying hao so tightly curled it looks like tiny roots gnarled a greenish-gray when it steeps it opens the way you woke this morning stretching your hands behind your head back arched toes pointing a smile steeped in ceremony a celebration the reaching of your arms
we drove through the gates into a maze of little roads with speed bumps now that circled a pavilion field house and ran past the playing fields and wound their way up to the cluster of wood and stone buildings of the school you went to once the green was returning to the trees and lawn the lake was still half-lidded with ice and blind in the middle there was nobody around except a few cars in front of the administration it must have been spring break we left without ever getting out of the car you were quiet that night the next day the way after heavy rain that the earth can not absorb the water lies in pools in unexpected places for days until it disappears
as much as you deserve it i wouldn ’ t wish this sunday night on you— not the osco at closing not its two tired women and shaky security guard not its bin of flip-flops and tasmanian devil baseball caps not its freshly mopped floors and fluorescent lights not its endless james taylor song on the intercom and not its last pint of chocolate mint ice cream which i carried down milwaukee ave. past a man in an unbuttoned baseball shirt who stepped out of a shadow to whisper how are you doing
i was hauling freight out of the carolinas up to the cumberland plateau when in tennessee i saw from the freeway at 2 am a house ablaze water from the firehoses arced into luminescent rainbows the only sound the dull roar of my truck passing i found myself strangely happy it was misfortune on that cold night falling on someone ’ s house but not mine not mine
the large man in the budweiser tee with serpents twining on his arms has leukemia it doesn ’ t seem right but they ’ ve told him he won ’ t die for years if he sticks with the treatment he ’ s talking about his years in the foundry running a crane on an overhead track in the mill eight hours a day moving ingots into rollers sometimes without a break because of the bother of getting down never had an accident never hurt anyone he had that much control his problem is that electricity arced through his body and accumulated when he got down at the end of a shift he could squeeze a forty-watt light bulb between thumb and finger and make it flare all the guys came around to see that
colorado turns kyoto in a shower mist in the pines so thick the crows delight or seem to winging in obscurity the ineffectual panic of a squirrel who chattered at my passing gave me pause to watch his ponderosa come and go— long needles scratching cloud i ’ d summited but knew it only by the wildflower meadow the muted harebells paintbrush gentian scattered among the locoweed and sage today my grief abated like water soaking underground its scar a little path of twigs and needles winding ahead of me downhill to the next bend today i let the rain soak through my shirt and was unharmed
your mother called it '' doing the pressing '' and you know now how right she was there is something urgent here not even the hiss under each button or the yellow business ground in at the neck can make one instant of this work seem unimportant you 've been taught to turn the pocket corners and pick out the dark lint that collects there you 're tempted to leave it but the old lessons go deeper than habits everyone else is asleep the odor of sweat rises when you do under the armpits the owner 's particular smell you can never quite wash out you 'll stay up you 'll have your way the final stroke and sharpness down the long sleeves a truly permanent edge
all our life so much laundry each day ’ s doing or not comes clean flows off and away to blend with other sins of this world each day begins in new skin blessed by the elements charged to take us out again to do or undo what ’ s been assigned from socks to shirts the selves we shed lift off the line as if they own a life apart from the one we offer there is joy in clean laundry all is forgiven in water sun and air we offer our day ’ s deeds to the blue-eyed sky with soap and prayer our arms up then lowered in supplication
you want to know what work is i ’ ll tell you what work is work is work you get up you get on the bus you don ’ t look from side to side you keep your eyes straight ahead that way nobody bothers you—see you get off the bus you work all day you get back on the bus at night same thing you go to sleep you get up you do the same thing again nothing more nothing less there ’ s no handouts in this life all this other stuff you ’ re looking for— it ain ’ t there work is work
all afternoon his tractor pulls a flat wagon with bales to the barn then back to the waiting chopped field it trails a feather of smoke down the block we bend with the season shoes to polish for a big game storm windows to batten or patch and how like a field is the whole sky now that the maples have shed their leaves too it makes us believers—stationed in groups leaning on rakes looking into space we rub blisters over billows of leaf smoke or stand alone bagging gold for the cold days to come
down here no light but what we carry with us everywhere we point our hands we scrawl color bulging eyes spines teeth or clinging tentacles at negative buoyancy when heavy hands seem to grasp pull us down we let them we don ’ t inflate our vests but let the scrubbed cheeks of rocks slide past in amniotic calm at sixty feet we douse our lights cemented by the weight of the dark of water the grip of the sea ’ s absolute silence our groping hands brush the open mouths of anemones which shower us in particles of phosphor radiant as halos as in meditation or in deepest prayer there is no knowing what we will see
anna bell and lane eighty make small leaf piles in the heat each pile a great joint effort like fifty years of marriage sharing chores a rusty dance in my own yard the stacks are big as children who scatter them dodge and limbo the poke of my rake we ’ re lucky young and straight-boned and i feel sorry for the couple bent like parentheses around their brittle little lawn i like feeling sorry for them the tenderness of it but only for a moment john glides in like a paper airplane takes the children for the weekend and i remember they ’ re the lucky ones— shriveled anna bell loving her crooked lane
it was solid hedge loops of bramble and thorny as it had to be with its berries thick as bumblebees it drew blood just to get there but i was queen of that place at ten though the berries shook like fists in the wind daring anyone to come in i was trying so hard to love this world—real rooms too big and full of worry to comfortably inhabit—but believing i was born to live in that cloistered green bower the raspberry patch in the back acre of my grandparents ’ orchard i was cross- stitched and beaded by its fat dollmaker ’ s needles the effort of sliding under the heavy spiked tangles that tore my clothes and smeared me with juice was rewarded with space wholly mine a kind of room out of the crush of the bushes with a canopy of raspberry dagger-leaves and a syrup of sun and birdsong hours would pass in the loud buzz of it blood made it mine—the adventure of that red sting singing down my calves the place the scratches brought me to just space enough for a girl to lie down
driving west through sandstone ’ s red arenas a rodeo of slow erosion cleaves these plains these ravaged cliffs this is cowboy country desolate dull except on weekends when cafés bloom like cactus after drought my rented mustang bucks the wind—i ’ m strapped up wide-eyed busting speed with both heels a sure grip on the wheel black clouds maneuver in the distance but i don ’ t care mileage is my obsession i ’ m always racing off passing through as though the present were a dying town i ’ d rather flee what matters is the future its glittering hotel clouds loom closer big as brahmas in the heavy air the radio crackles like a shattered rib i ’ m in the chute i check the gas and set my jaw i ’ m almost there
minutes ago those quick cleft hoofs lifted the dik-dik ’ s speckled frame now the cheetah dips her delicate head to the still-pulsating guts our rover ’ s so close we need no zoom to fix the green shot of her eyes the matted red mess of her face you come here recall a father hale in his ordinary life not his last bed not the long tasteless slide of tapioca this is the great rift where it all began here where the warthogs and hartebeest feed in the scrub giraffes splay to drink and our rank diesel exhaust darkens the air for only a few moments before vanishing
you used to be able to flag a ride in this country impossible now—everyone is afraid of strangers well there was fear then too and it was mutual drivers versus hitchhikers and we rode without seat belts insurance or beliefs people would see me far ahead on a hill like a seedling watch me grow in the windshield and not know they were going to stop until they got right up to me maybe they wanted company or thought i ’ d give them some excitement it was the age of impulse of lonesome knee jerks an old woman stopped blew smoke in my face and after i was already in her car she asked me if i wanted a ride i ’ m telling you late one night a construction boss pulled over one of his crew had been hit by the mob he said as he drove distraught and needing to talk to someone we rode around for a long time he said i never wore a gun to a funeral before but they ’ ve got ta be after me too then he looked at me and patted the bulge in his coat don ’ t worry he said you ’ re safe
you follow close behind me for a thousand miles responsive to my movements i signal you signal back we will meet at the next exit you blow kisses which i return you mouth `` i love you '' a message for my rearview mirror we do a slow tango as we change lanes in tandem gracefully as though music were guiding us it is tighter than bodies locked in heat this caring this ardent watching
i walk into the bakery next door to my apartment they are about to pull some sort of toast with cheese from the oven when i ask what ’ s that smell i am being a poet i am asking what everyone else in the shop wanted to ask but somehow couldn ’ t i am speaking on behalf of two other customers who wanted to buy the name of it i ask the woman behind the counter for a percentage of her sale am i flirting am i happy because the days are longer here ’ s what she does she takes her time choosing the slices “ i am picking out the good ones ” she tells me it ’ s april 14th spring with five to ten degrees to go some days i feel my duty some days i love my work
farewell to the starlight in whiskey so long to the sunshine in beer the booze made me cocky and frisky but worried the man in the mirror goodnight to the moonlight in brandy adieu to the warmth of the wine i think i can finally stand me without a glass or a stein bye-bye to the balm in the vodka ta-ta to the menthol in gin i 'm trying to do what i ought to rejecting that snake medicine i wo n't miss the blackouts and vomit the accidents and regret if i can stay off the rotgut there might be a chance for me yet so so long to god in a bottle to the lies of rum and vermouth let me slake my thirst with water and the sweet transparent truth
from michigan our son writes how many elk how many big horn sheep it 's spring and soon they 'll be gone above timberline climbing to tundra by summer some boys are born to wander my wife says but rocky slopes with spruce and douglas fir are home he tried the navy the marines but even the army would n't take him not with a foot like that maybe it 's in the genes i think of wild-eyed years till i was twenty and cringe i loved motorcycles too dumb to say no to our son—too many switchbacks in mountains too many icy spots in spring doctors stitched back his scalp hoisted him in traction like a twisted frame i sold the motorbike to a junkyard but half his foot was gone last month he cashed his paycheck at the harley house roared off with nothing but a backpack waving his headband leaning into a downhill curve and gone
when clouds turn heavy rich and mottled as an oyster bed when the temperature drops so fast that fog conjures itself inside the cars as if the parking lots were filled with row upon row of lovers when my umbrella veils my face and threatens to reverse itself at every gust of wind and rain lashes my legs and the hem of my skirt but i am walking to meet a man who ’ ll buy me coffee and kiss my fingers— what can be more beautiful then than these boys sprinting through the storm laughing shouldering the rain aside running to their dorms perhaps to class carrying like torches their useless shoes
“ the trouble with intellectuals ” manny my boss once told me “ is that they don ’ t know nothing till they can explain it to themselves a guy like that ” he said “ he gets to middle age—and by the way he gets there late he ’ s trying to be a boy until he ’ s forty forty-five and then you give him five more years until that craziness peters out and now he ’ s almost fifty—a guy like that at last explains to himself that life is made of time that time is what it ’ s all about aha he says and then he either blows his brains out gets religion or settles down to some major-league depression make yourself useful hand me that three-eights torque wrench—no you moron the other one ”
three teenage girls in tight red sleeveless blouses and black capri pants and colorful headscarves secured in a knot to their chins are walking down the hill chatting laughing cupping their cigarettes against the light rain the closest to the road with her left thumb stuck out not looking at the cars going past every friday night to the dance and wet or dry they get where they ’ re going walk two miles or get a ride and now the two-door 1950 dodge dark green darkening as evening falls stops they nudge each other peer in shrug two scramble into the back seat and the third the boldest famous for twice running away from home slides in front with the man who reaches across her body and pulls the door shut
all morning you ’ ve studied the laws of spoons the rules of books the dynamics of the occasional plate observed the principles governing objects in motion and objects at rest to see if it will fall and if it does how far if it will rage like a lost penny or ring like a chinese gong—because it doesn ’ t have to—you lean from your chair and hold your cup over the floor it curves in your hand it weighs in your palm it arches like a wave it is a dipper full of stars and you ’ re the wind timing the pull of the moon you ’ re the water measuring the distance from which we fall
a slow news day but i did like the obit about the butcher who kept the same store for fifty years people remembered when his street was sweetly roaring aproned with flower stalls and fish stands the stock market wandered spooked by presidential winks by micro-winds and the shadows of earnings news was stationed around the horizon ready as summer clouds to thunder -- but it moved off and we covered the committee meeting at the back of the statehouse sat around on our desks then went home early the birds were still singing the sun just going down working these long hours you forget how beautiful the early evening can be the big houses like ships turning into the night their rooms piled high with silence
not a remarkable wind so when the bistro ’ s patio umbrella blew suddenly free and pitched into the middle of the road it put a stop to the afternoon something white and amazing was blocking the way a waiter in a clean apron appeared not quite certain shielding his eyes wary of our rumbling engines he knelt in the hot road making two figures in white one leaning over the sprawled broken shape of the other creaturely great-winged and now so carefully gathered in
when the plowblade struck an old stump hiding under the soil like a beggar ’ s rotten tooth they swarmed up mister jackson left the plow wedged like a whaler ’ s harpoon the horse was midnight against dusk tethered to somebody ’ s pocketwatch he shivered but not the way women shook their heads before mirrors at the five dime—a deeper connection to the low field ’ s evening star he stood there in tracechains lathered in froth just stopped by a great goofy calmness he whinnied once then the whole beautiful blue-black sky fell on his back
the humble sense of being alive under the towering sun fills the nectary and ripens apricots down to the last one if mnemosyne wakens from apathy each moment it is the soft burly sound of a bee tumbled in fritillary is it not but if memory as if to illustrate the mind was not yours to have the mind was not given fails us leaving us in our underpants in the garden should we not hate the garden or the woman whose garden it is and sunlight thunder rain hardened in heart against what earth compels and seizes goddamning goddamned rain
when we finally flip it over the fireflies are out the neighbor boy has had his stitches in so i can finally admit i think it is all fantastic the suck of the spark plug undone the stuck blade bent into the guard and the sound of the hammer ’ s head reshaping the metal in this our suburban eden we ’ ve only a teenage adam too dreamy to manage his motorized scythe and silly eve leaving her coffee cups and plastic plant pots behind in the grass though it ’ s a long way from a fall this spring ’ s first disaster i did like the thin thread of red on his upper lip and i like my mower turned over among the glowworms a monstrous dandelion as unnatural as we are out in a garden with our untidy golds and our dangerous sharps
a recipe for lamb tagine demands a mysterious ingredient raz el hanout animal vegetable compound of kings like myrrh i decide not to look it up to wait and see at first it is everything we seek but can ’ t express then it reverses everything thrust upon us—think fast — by the universe like the leg my friend tom caught when a cyclist got clipped by a car the driver stinking drunk at 9:00 am severed above the knee the leg flung itself into the air a javelin tom always quick reached up and caught it but the story has a twist after the cyclist died in an ambulance the widow inexplicably came on to tom not that tom is unattractive indeed he is the sort of man i ’ d throw myself at if i were a leg it ’ s hard to imagine the sex that tom and this woman would have had there in the hotel room with the blackout curtains pulled i ’ ve never had sex with tom myself but if i had been that leg or that woman i might have whispered “ what fine reflexes you have sir ” “ sir say something tender ” “ cradle me against the guttural gasp from your solar plexus. ” “ oh sir i sense the tip of bone on skin a surge of déjà vu. ” “ i am coming i am about to come your shuddering lover your raz el hanout ”
tricky work sometimes not to smell yourself ferment being constant—constant as carnival sweat a non-stock phrase i palmed from a girl from canada a land where i once saw this graffiti life is great and i have tasted myself especially when i spilled sinigang all down my arm in a pinoy workers caff in little manila i drank sinigang is soup drunk in big manila too with all its dead skyscrapers seen myself in looking glasses or looking down stocky as a shift working cop maybe a mexican cop full of beans frijoles i mean not vim paunch full of sopa de vigilia pulling over a sozzled bus driver heard myself speak fluently in my own language have heard myself too described as hard work as hard to get through as scotch broth though once someone rather bladdered told me i was magnetic and i may as well admit that i have touched myself who has n't in a forest on a train in new york and paris with unparalleled handiwork sinning as i go merry as an office boy spooning onion soup
sugar dries on paper plates the cake ’ s decimated and barely touched what to do with the balloons a few float listlessly unattached still bearing like bandages the tape that bore them to the wall they ’ ve gone dull rubber tips darkening to a bottle ’ s pinch it ’ s too late or too early there are too many on the floor stirred up as i stir in the end i cut them urge a blade into the inch between knot and blossom slow deflation it reveals what they are sacs of plastic stale with air i ’ ve seen this before in the newspaper picture of nefertiti bound in the antechamber of a tomb cast out of favor her body barely wrapped how they know her by the queenly jaw age of limbs and teeth also by the broken mouth smashed by priests so she can not eat can not breathe in the afterlife
surely there are teeth so small i have listened for their turning this frail swell and fall like old blood yearning upwards through the skin of days slowly i am learning their count though numbers fray in me and the loaded instants graft coming always to the same tangle the distant cry merging with the song at hand the rain ’ s insistent opening in daylong dryness the plain moon draining into dawn and below it all hewn from the pliant light of some geneva noon they spin time ’ s thrum stopped i have bent my ears to them i have become sound inside their years surely i have known the whole of grief and grace in gears

the shoemaker ’ s wife ran preschool with a fist made not so much of iron but wire bristles on a wooden brush she made us recite and learn by rote our trick was to mouth words sound as if we knew what we would one day come to know what would dawn on us as sure as a centipede knows what to do with its myriad legs she made us settle our feet on the mud floor of her daub and wattle hut and she wielded a cane cut from wood that bit into the palm of the hand and left a burn that resonated up the arm for an age after its smart swing and crisp contact worst of all was the shoe cupboard where the old man stored his wire brushes a cold dark narrow place replete with brushes hung on nails covering every square inch and said to come alive when a child was locked in with them so that they scrubbed flesh off that child ’ s bones she said we would end up there if we did not concentrate so we stilled our feet and spoke the words in the right order for colors in a rainbow until the very thing took her place in front of us arranged in cuneiform polished brandishing a window to climb out

my chalk is no longer than a chip of fingernail chip by which i must explain this monday night the verbs “ to get ” “ to wear ” “ to cut. ” i ’ m not given much these tired students knuckle-wrapped from work as roofers sour from scrubbing toilets and pedestal sinks i ’ m given this room with five windows a coffee machine a piano with busted strings the music of how we feel as the sun falls exhausted from keeping up i stand at the blackboard the chalk is worn to a hangnail nearly gone the dust of some educational bone by and by i ’ m cantiflas the comic busybody in front i say “ i get the coffee. ” i pick up a coffee cup and sip i click my heels and say “ i wear my shoes. ” i bring an invisible fork to my mouth and say “ i eat the chicken. ” suddenly the class is alive— each one putting on hats and shoes drinking sodas and beers cutting flowers and steaks—a pantomime of sumptuous living at break i pass out cookies augustine the guatemalan asks in spanish “ teacher what is ‘ tally-ho ’ ” i look at the word in the composition book i raise my face to the bare bulb for a blind answer i stutter then say “ es como adelante. ” augustine smiles then nudges a friend in the next desk now smarter by one word after the cookies are eaten we move ahead to prepositions— “ under ” “ over ” and “ between ” useful words when la migra opens the doors of their idling vans at ten to nine i ’ m tired of acting and they ’ re tired of their roles when class ends i clap my hands of chalk dust and two students applaud thinking it ’ s a new verb i tell them adelante and they pick up their old books they smile and in return cry “ tally-ho. ” as they head for the door
yes i 've been in rome at least two times though on second thought it probably was three or maybe five when was the last that 's easy for i remember it exactly— at least what it was like when i first left you mean a part of you remains in rome not really for when i was first in rome i was truly there that ended the second time though i only realized it when i first left so when you were in rome your last time was consumed by thoughts of leaving not exactly as time went on i came around at last thinking obsess about leaving and nothing lasts i 'll end up never having been in rome yet back then did you know just what exactly it meant to be in rome during that time you thought about leaving even if it was then you saw what you 'd lose if you had left even at the time when i first left i 'd no idea but you 're not saying the last you saw of rome was your third visit for wasn't it earlier that you felt you 'd never leave rome no all that happened there my second time though to this day i feel about rome exactly what i felt from the first what that means exactly is hard to say for perhaps i never left since after all my being there the first time did n't involve my leaving tell me then at last was it once or twice were you really in rome why certainly—i 'm sure i know i was and on top of that you might even say i was there time and again everything there exactly just the same or like my last time in rome me feeling as if i 'd never really left but tell me now precisely was the last you saw of rome indeed that second time to be exact it happened the very first time that i saw rome darkness falling as i left causing me to see what simply could n't last
i wake to the sound of water and think '' mother has died and gone to france '' she is at un autre hôtel speaking french better than ever while i stare at the fog that has a river in it—the broad dordogne making its river noise as if all the faucets have been left on all night the river rushing in one direction only so different from blackfish creek where the sea floods in and back scrubbing the sand both ways well one travels so things are different american actors speak french on tv here last night they showed accident catastrophe about two babies switched in the hospital at birth one dies the parents discover the dead child was someone else 's and their child is alive in florida with son père though sa mère est morte de some disease who knows anyway ed asner who plays the lawyer speaks gravelly french but people have an american demeanor they pull their hair on the edge of violence then each family gives up a piece and the child ends up more loved than ever as if it 's inevitable or so the river is telling me with its one-way simplicity like gravity `` alive in the eternal heart of france '' —that 's mother i 'm thinking about for some reason maybe the journal my wife 's been keeping so like the daily letters mother wrote to sa mère et son père when her life was flowing through her like the broad dordogne and where is she now does she wish my father were with her one of him alive and one with her a bell is ringing wildly each of its peals like a round boat rolling downstream where the river divides around an island only to sweep back into itself somewhere in the fog
my first day leading the prison writing workshop carlos complimented my choosing the chair nearest the door i read a poem by whitman that once sent me hitchhiking and carlos stood up asked to read a section from his four hundred-page work-in-progress a poem that turns on his first finding neruda 's `` one year walk '' he said it lit up the night like a perfect crime so i left everything— i had no choice—walked three thousand miles to the pacific from memory he recited a passage in which his father left the family a small fortune all counterfeit though i doubted the facts i can still see that worn briefcase almost-perfect hundreds stacked neatly in shrink-wrapped packs i was young it took me two weeks to accept that i could teach this lifer nothing world of concrete floors and everlasting light he was grateful to god who gave him a blazing mind not granted to anyone living or dead and would n't have changed a word anyway
when i dare at last to imagine hunger see farmer wandering his parched fields knowing nothing to do finally but sleep the day out in the barn 's long shadow dreaming of the family dog he drove deep into a neighboring county and abandoned by the side of the road weeks later a boy finds it in a ditch— timid and gimp a halo of gnats festering between its swollen testicles and wormy flanks—and he coaxes it into some pines tethers it with a tentstake and a chain as the late summer light spirals and drapes over the branches a mirage the dog slavers and snaps at consider the boy 's amusement as he imagines the animal jerking the light down and the ruckus of bells that clang and catapult from the treetop belfries the canopy rent like a piñata spilling licorice and circus peanuts coins and fluttering dollar bills the real possibilities are beyond him the dog as a parable of pain or loss hunger as some small iridescent thing at work inside the animal hovering around its heart the way a lone dragonfly skirts the dry pond crater dismantling the day—light unstitched from dust dust unbuckled from air by now the dog 's given up and the boy watches its tongue loll in the pine needles the heave and fall of its stomach its eyes following birdflight in and out of the shade restless for something he can not name he imagines the music he might make if he thumped the dog 's belly like a drum imagines its eyes are the color of iron imagines the unimaginable and does it the tire tool and the belly unwilling instruments and the dog 's caterwaul is not like music at all and when night comes the cricketsong dulcifies nothing the dog 's body is just a body is not paltry is not glorified what hunger is this that haunts the boy that haunts the man sleeping in the shade watch as the dragonfly dips into his open mouth and keeps going a blur between bone and sinew a wet thread collapsing soft caverns of flesh gone to where his body is a field honed by sleeves of sunlight to where the boy ceases to be and the man wakes he knows what flits through him now keeps the time with its thrumming carrying him away from himself into himself to where the dog roves in the shadows— ravenous luminous—its tail bobbing in the heat a winnowing sliver of light

the writer is john ruskin on his wedding journey in venice my dearest father it is the year ’ s first day yet so like the last in venice no one could tell this birth from the lees i know it is some while since you received a word of mine there has been the shabbiest sort of interruption to our exchanges to mine at least in the shape of a fever—nights of those imaginings strange but shameful too of the infinite by way of bedcovers and boa constrictors with cold wedges of ice as i thought laid down at the corners of the bed making me slip to its coiling center where i could not breathe you knew from my last i think i had again gone to the zoological gardens and seen the great boa take rabbits which gave me an idea or two and a headache then i had too much wine that same night dreamed of a walk with nurse to whom i showed a lovely snake i promised her was an innocent one it had a slender neck with a green ring round it and i made her feel the scales when she bade me feel them too it turned to a fat thing like a leech and adhered to my hand so that i could scarcely pull it off— and i awakened so much father for my serpentine fancies to a vermillion dawn fever fallen and the sea horizon dark sharp and blue and far beyond it faint with trebled distance came on the red vertical cliffs in a tremor of light i could not see without recalling turner who had taught me so to see it yet the whole subdued to one soft gray and that morning i had your letter father telling of the death of my earthly master how much more i feel this now perhaps it is worth noting here the appearance of my first gray hair this morning —more than i thought i should everything in the sun in the sky so speaks of him so mourns their great witness lost today the weather is wretched cold and rainy dark like england at this season i do begin to lose all faith in these provinces even the people look to me ugly except children from eight to fourteen who here as in italy anywhere are glorious so playful and bright in expression so beautiful in feature so dark in eye and soft in hair—creatures quite unrivalled at fifteen they degenerate into malignant vagabonds or sensual lumps of lounging fat and this latter-day venice father where by night the black gondolas are just traceable beside one as if cadmus had sown the wrong teeth and grown dragons not men the grand canal this month is all hung from end to end with carpets and tapestries like a street of old-clothes warehouses and now there is even talk of taking down soon tintoretto ’ s paradise to “ restore ” it father without the turner gallery i do believe i should go today and live in a cave on some cliffside—among crows oh what fools they are this restoring pack yet smoothing all manner of rottenness up with words my turner would not phrase like these and only once in all the years i knew him said “ thank you mr. ruskin. ” my own power if it be that would be lost by mere fine writing you know i promised no romance— i promised them stones not even bread father i do not feel any romance in venice here is no “ abiding city ” here is but a heap of ruins trodden underfoot by such men as ezekiel angrily describes here are lonely and stagnant canals bordered for the most part by blank walls of gardens now waste ground or by patches of mud with decayed black gondolas lying keel-upmost sinking gradually into the putrid soil to give turner ’ s joy of this place would not take ten days of study father or of residence it is more than joy that must be the great fact i would teach i am not sure even that joy is a fact i am certainly only of the strong instinct in me i can not reason this to draw delimit the things i love—oh not for reputation or the good of others or my own advantage but a sort of need like that for water and food i should like to draw all saint mark ’ s stone by stone and all this city oppressive and choked with slime as it is effie of course declares each day that we must leave a woman can not help having no heart but that is hardly a reason she should have no manners yes to eat it all into my mind— touch by touch i have been reading paradise regained lately father it seems to me a parallel to turner ’ s last pictures—the mind failing altogether yet with intervals and such returns of power “ thereupon satan bowing low his gray dissimulation disappeared. ” now he is gone my dark angel and i never had such a conception of the way i must mourn—not what i lose now but what i have lost until now yet there is more pain knowing that i must forget it all that in a year i shall have no more awareness of his loss than of that fair landscape i saw waking the morning your letter arrived no more left about me than a fading pigment all the present glory like the present pain is no use to me it hurts me rather from my fear of leaving it of losing it yet i know that were i to stay here it would soon cease being glory to me—that it has ceased already to produce the impression and the delight i can bear only the first days at a place when all the dread of losing is lost in the delirium of its possession i daresay love is very well when it does not mean leaving behind as it does always somehow with me i have not the heart for more now father though i thank you and mother for all the comfort of your words they bring me with his loss to what i said once the lines on this place you will know “ the shore lies naked under the night pathless comfortless and infirm in dark languor still except where salt runlets plash into tideless pools or seabirds flit from their margins with a questioning cry. ” the light is gone from the waters with my fallen angel gone now as all must go your loving son john
you used to say “ june honey when you come down here you supposed to stay with me where else ” meanin home against the beer the shotguns and the point of view of whitemen don ’ never see black anybodies without some violent itch start up the ones who said “ no nigga ’ s votin in this town lessen it be feet first to the booth ” then jailed you beat you brutal bloody/battered/beat you blue beyond the feeling of the terrible and failed to stop you only god could but he wouldn ’ t stop you fortress from self- pity humble as a woman anywhere i remember finding you inside the laundromat in ruleville lion spine relaxed/hell what ’ s the point to courage when you washin clothes but that took courage just to sit there/target to the killers lookin for your singin face perspirey through the rinse and spin and later you stood mighty in the door on james street loud callin “ bullets or no bullets the food is cooked an ’ gettin cold ” we ate a family tremulous but fortified by turnips/okra/handpicked like the lilies filled to the very living full one solid gospel sanctified one gospel peace one full black lily luminescent in a homemade field of love
don ’ t ever get the idea i am a poet you can see me at the racetrack any day half drunk betting quarters sidewheelers and straight thoroughs but let me tell you there are some women there who go where the money goes and sometimes when you look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores you wonder sometimes if nature isn ’ t playing a joke dealing out so much breast and ass and the way it ’ s all hung together you look and you look and you look and you can ’ t believe it there are ordinary women and then there is something else that wants to make you tear up paintings and break albums of beethoven across the back of the john anyhow the season was dragging and the big boys were getting busted all the non-pros the producers the cameraman the pushers of mary the fur salesman the owners themselves and saint louie was running this day a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly and 35 to 1 and i put a ten down on him the driver broke him wide took him out by the fence where he ’ d be alone even if he had to travel four times as far and that ’ s the way he went it all the way by the outer fence traveling two miles in one and he won like he was mad as hell and he wasn ’ t even tired and the biggest blonde of all all ass and breast hardly anything else went to the payoff window with me that night i couldn ’ t destroy her although the springs shot sparks and they pounded on the walls later she sat there in her slip drinking old grandad and she said what ’ s a guy like you doing living in a dump like this and i said i ’ m a poet and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed you you a poet i guess you ’ re right i said i guess you ’ re right but still she looked good to me she still looked good and all thanks to an ugly horse who wrote this poem
he lives in a house with a swimming pool and says the job is killing him he is 27. i am 44. i can ’ t seem to get rid of him his novels keep coming back “ what do you expect me to do ” he screams “ go to new york and pump the hands of the publishers ” “ no ” i tell him “ but quit your job go into a small room and do the thing. ” “ but i need assurance i need something to go by some word some sign ” “ some men did not think that way van gogh wagner— ” “ oh hell van gogh had a brother who gave him paints whenever he needed them ” “ look ” he said “ i ’ m over at this broad ’ s house today and this guy walks in a salesman you know how they talk drove up in this new car talked about his vacation said he went to frisco—saw fidelio up there but forgot who wrote it now this guy is 54 years old so i told him ‘ fidelio is beethoven ’ s only opera. ’ and then i told him ‘ you ’ re a jerk ’ ‘ whatcha mean ’ he asked ‘ i mean you ’ re a jerk you ’ re 54 years old and you don ’ t know anything ’ ” “ what happened then ” “ i walked out. ” “ you mean you left him there with her ” “ yes. ” “ i can ’ t quit my job ” he said “ i always have trouble getting a job i walk in they look at me listen to me talk and they think right away ah ha he ’ s too intelligent for this job he won ’ t stay so there ’ s really no sense in hiring him now you walk into a place and you don ’ t have any trouble you look like an old wino you look like a guy who needs a job and they look at you and they think ah ha now here ’ s a guy who really needs work if we hire him he ’ ll stay a long time and work hard ” “ do any of those people ” he asks “ know you are a writer that you write poetry ” “ no. ” “ you never talk about it not even to me if i hadn ’ t seen you in that magazine i ’ d have never known. ” “ that ’ s right. ” “ still i ’ d like to tell these people that you are a writer. ” “ i ’ d still like to tell them. ” “ why ” “ well they talk about you they think you are just a horseplayer and a drunk. ” “ i am both of those. ” “ well they talk about you you have odd ways you travel alone i ’ m the only friend you have. ” “ yes. ” “ they talk you down i ’ d like to defend you i ’ d like to tell them you write poetry. ” “ leave it alone i work here like they do we ’ re all the same. ” “ well i ’ d like to do it for myself then i want them to know why i travel with you i speak 7 languages i know my music— ” “ forget it. ” “ all right i ’ ll respect your wishes but there ’ s something else— ” “ what ” “ i ’ ve been thinking about getting a piano but then i ’ ve been thinking about getting a violin too but i can ’ t make up my mind ” “ buy a piano. ” “ you think so ” “ yes. ” he walks away thinking about it i was thinking about it too i figure he can always come over with his violin and more sad music
we finished clearing the last section of trail by noon high on the ridge-side two thousand feet above the creek reached the pass went on beyond the white pine groves granite shoulders to a small green meadow watered by the snow edged with aspen—sun straight high and blazing but the air was cool ate a cold fried trout in the trembling shadows i spied a glitter and found a flake black volcanic glass—obsidian— by a flower hands and knees pushing the bear grass thousands of arrowhead leavings over a hundred yards not one good head just razor flakes on a hill snowed all but summer a land of fat summer deer they came to camp on their own trails i followed my own trail here picked up the cold-drill pick singlejack and sack of dynamite ten thousand years
some students were stretching a professor on a medieval torture rack he had offered himself to show them how an academic might be stretched beyond his wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum and as they turned the wheel the professor was getting longer and longer don ’ t make me too long or i ’ ll look kind of goofy sighed the professor as he grew longer and longer suddenly something snaps what happened sighs the professor from the rack we were just stretching an academic when suddenly something snapped you may have heard it ... yes i was there don ’ t you remember sighs the professor and then we heard an academic sigh ... yes i heard it too sighs the professor it seemed to come from the rack where i was being stretched beyond my wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum ...
the hounds you know them all by name you fostered them from purblind whelps at their dam ’ s teats and you have come to know the music of their yelps high-strung anthee the brindled bitch the blue-tick coated philomel and freckled chloe who would fetch a pretty price if you would sell— all fleet of foot and swift to scent inexorable once on the track like angry words you might have meant but do not mean and can ’ t take back there was a time when you would brag how they would bay and rend apart the hopeless belling from a stag you falter now for the foundered hart desires you nursed of a winter night— did you know then why you bred them— whose needling milk-teeth used to bite the master ’ s hand that leashed and fed them
you call me to the bath where by evening light before bed i rub the ointment into your maculate back i place my hand between the wings of your scapulae where you can not reach can not see—the arc of your life revealed in its pattern of coffee-colored spots—and hover there awhile remembering how we watched the lover read the manuscript painted on the skin of his beloved how he pressed the words to his chest and face—and cried out the arteries in my palm open their warmth rising between us as i massage you neither sexual nor umbilical this connection—you trusting your back to me and me with no deceit only salve only unguent only balm
the best job i had was moving a stone from one side of the road to the other this required a permit which required a bribe the bribe took all my salary yet because i hadn ’ t finished the job i had no salary and to pay the bribe i took a job moving the stone the other way because the official wanted his bribe he gave me a permit for the second job when i pointed out that the work would be best completed if i did nothing he complimented my brain and wrote a letter to my employer suggesting promotion on stationery bearing the wings of a raptor spread in flight over a mountain smaller than the bird my boss fearing my intelligence paid me to sleep on the sofa and take lunch with the official who required a bribe to keep anything from being done when i told my parents they wrote my brother to come home from university to be slapped on the back of the head dutifully he arrived and bowed to receive his instruction at which point sense entered his body and he asked what i could do by way of a job i pointed out there were stones everywhere trying not to move all it took was a little gumption to be the man who didn ’ t move them it was harder to explain the intricacies of not obtaining a permit to not do this just yesterday he got up at dawn and shaved as if the lack of hair on his face has anything to do with the appearance of food on an empty table
who will you point to in the needle 's eye or selling what you won at the strait gate who will know how to kiss you and just when to pull the hair at your neck and say your name no single victim will ever be the last not at least until one victim purifies the whole issue of suffering by crying out that his pain means nothing because it comes from nowhere and goes nowhere the clusters of exiles in their storefronts will be free then history will end lover will take her hand from her lover 's mouth and see only his mouth not a sightless fish 's eye scored onto the sheet 's marble it 's a wise child who knows it is no angel the rest of us grow up hovering visiting our lives in the moment of pain or orgasm or when the little fingers of pity push inside us and we feel loved our suffering gales beneath our wings like applause we long to repeat it to explain it to stay aloft and clear our lives in that mid-heaven of nostalgia and apology we hover over the camps the forced retreats the ends of nations that no one can recall now except as code words for catastrophe we alight for pleasure touching the victims as the hurt husband touches the bed his wife has left father loved you with a passion or else from fear of your long inarticulate future he turned silent edging into crank broadcasts by a small radio on the screened porch perhaps as my father did he moved out into another house and had a daughter with a redheaded woman who mistook his silence for grief my father never lost anything for years i went to school with the daughter as she grew fat and her red hair reached her knees who were the victims at what moment should my father have cried out the mothers have cried out or i have taken the fat hand of my sister and walked off through the needle 's eye and it 's a wise child who can understand that the mothers and fathers on the trains see only the receding pastorals the lamplit villages of other angels and that his suffering is only one pinpoint on a lithic hoarding of departures each passenger reads like an advertisement of heaven the wise child goes crazy how could he not how could he not be heartbroken to learn that even compassion is compassionless that it uses the real or imagined pain of others and himself for wings for memory for a marriage proposal for the cruel angelism that adores victims and makes a fifth airier element out of pain we recede we recede a virus finds that place deepest behind the heart where it unweaves itself into a pattern of false starts like knots of villages and the one house lightening at the crest of a green street as its doors close to us dearest that is another crime of pluralism hope jagged with beginnings scatters our one real life among a dozen houses little illnesses of longing whose low fevers contract the heart you have but one heart and i have one at the crest of a green street we give them away the night thanks us the fences shiver with cats and the flowers close feeling comes from nowhere and goes nowhere it is not a train it is not one instance of lovemaking or a lifetime spent together running the dogs dying finally face down in the yard bed of herbs we are all the same or rather we should believe we are the same in order to be happy with the same things and not to be stealing from each other we put each other in camps i crush my lover with a kiss and then it is impossible to love her what must die if we are to live without barbed wire and bad sex is the very idea of otherness and to kill the idea we have merely to find one victim in ourselves who will die for nothing my father could not stop getting children the people on the trains can not stop watching the passing villages for their own ghosts and early angels i can not stop finding houses in which to lose my heart a dozen times in the fits and starts of a little passion exalted life is not going to be bearable i think for a long time the exiles will play cards in their storefront lodges history will slide on and one will pull the hair at my neck and one will cover my mouth as she makes love to me the streets are snowed in under heaven 's leaflets our beds are scored with the sightless eyes the eyes of others the air is sickeningly heavy with applause

and then we cowards who loved the whispering evening the houses the paths by the river the dirty red lights of those places the sweet soundless sorrow— we reached our hands out toward the living chain in silence but our heart startled us with blood and no more sweetness then no more losing ourselves on the path by the river— no longer slaves we knew we were alone and alive
i was on the porch pinching back the lobelia like trimming a great blue head of hair we ’ d just planted the near field the far one the day before i ’ d never seen it so clear so gusty so overcast so clear so calm they say pearls must be worn or they lose their luster and that morning i happened to remember so i put them on for milking finding some sympathy i guess between the two usually i don ’ t sit down until much later in the day the lobelia was curling in the sun one by one birds flew off and that should have been a sign trust is made and broken i hardly sit down at all it was the time of year for luna moths but we hadn ’ t had any yet settling on the porch or hovering above the garden i ’ d let the wild rose take
we pull off to a road shack in massachusetts to watch men walk on the moon we did the same thing for three two one blast off and now we watch the same men bounce in and out of craters i want a coke and a hamburger because the men are walking on the moon which is now irrefutably not green not cheese not a shiny dime floating in a cold blue the way i 'd thought the road shack people don't notice we are a black family not from there the way it mostly goes this talking through static bounces in space- boots tethered to cords is much stranger stranger even than we are

the drunk mechanic is happy to be in the ditch from the tavern five minutes through the dark field and you ’ re home but first there ’ s the cool grass to enjoy and the mechanic will sleep here till dawn a few feet away the red and black sign that rises from the field if you ’ re too close you can ’ t read it it ’ s that big at this hour it ’ s still wet dew later the streets will cover it with dust as it covers the bushes the mechanic beneath it stretches in sleep silence is total shortly in the warmth of the sun one car after another will pass waking the dust at the top of the hill they slow down for the curve then plunge down the slope a few of the cars stop at the garage in the dust to drink a few liters at this time of the morning the mechanics still dazed will be sitting on oil drums waiting for work it ’ s a pleasure to spend the morning sitting in the shade where the stink of oil ’ s cut with the smell of green of tobacco of wine and where work comes to them right to the door sometimes it ’ s even amusing peasants ’ wives come to scold them blaming the garage for the traffic—it frightens the animals and women— and for making their husbands look sullen quick trips down the hill into turin that lighten their wallets between laughing and selling gas one of them will pause these fields it ’ s plain to see are covered with road dust if you try to sit on the grass it ’ ll drive you away on the hillside there ’ s a vineyard he prefers to all others and in the end he ’ ll marry that vineyard and the sweet girl who comes with it and he ’ ll go out in the sun to work but now with a hoe and his neck will turn brown and he ’ ll drink wine pressed on fall evenings from his own grapes cars pass during the night too but more quietly so quiet the drunk in the ditch hasn ’ t woken at night they don ’ t raise much dust and the beams of their headlights as they round the curve reveal in full the sign in the field near dawn they glide cautiously along you can ’ t hear a thing except maybe the breeze and from the top of the hill they disappear into the plain sinking in shadows
a full year passed the seasons keep me honest since i last noticed this same commotion who knew god was an abstract expressionist i ’ m asking myself—the very question i asked last year staring out at this array of racing colors then set in motion by the chance invasion of a steller ’ s jay is this what people mean by speed of light my usually levelheaded mulberry tree hurling arrows everywhere in sight— its bow the out-of-control virginia creeper my friends say i should do something about whose vermilion went at least a full shade deeper at the provocation of the upstart blue the leaves half green half gold suddenly hyper in savage competition with that red and blue— tohubohu returned in living color kandinsky where were you when i needed you my attempted poem would lie fallow a year i was so busy focusing on the desert ’ s stinginess with everything but rumor no place even for the spectrum ’ s introverts— rose olive gray—no pigment at all— and certainly no room for shameless braggarts like the ones that barge in here every fall and make me feel like an unredeemed failure even more emphatically than usual and here they are again their fleet allure still more urgent this time—the desert ’ s gone i ’ m through with it want something fuller— why shouldn ’ t a person have a little fun some utterly unnecessary extravagance which was—at least i think it was—god ’ s plan when he set up such things are never left to chance that one split-second assignation with genuine no-kidding-around omnipotence what for lack of better words i ’ m calling vision you breathe in and for once there ’ s something there just when you thought you ’ d learned some resignation there ’ s real resistance in the nearby air until the entire universe is swayed even that desert of yours isn ’ t quite so bare and god ’ s not nonexistent he ’ s just been waylaid by a host of what no one could ’ ve foreseen he ’ s got plans for you this red-gold-green parade is actually a fairly detailed outline david never needed one but he ’ s long dead and god could use a little recognition he promises it won ’ t go to his head and if you praise him properly an autumn psalm why didn ’ t i think of that you ’ ll have it made but while it ’ s true that my virginia creeper praises him its palms and fingers crimson with applause that the local breeze is weaving him a diadem inspecting my tree ’ s uncut gold for flaws i came to talk about the way that violet-blue sprang the greens and reds and yellows into action actual motion i swear it ’ s true though i ’ m not sure i ever took it in now i ’ d be prepared if some magician flew into my field of vision to realign that dazzle out my window yet again it ’ s not likely but i ’ m keeping my eyes open though i still wouldn ’ t be able to explain precisely what happened to these vines these trees it isn ’ t available in my tradition for this i would have to be chinese wang wei to be precise on a mountain autumn rain converging on the trees a cassia flower nearby a cloud a pine washerwomen heading home for the day my senses and the mountain so entirely in tune that when my stroke of blue arrives i ’ m ready though there is no rain here the air ’ s shot through with gold on golden leaves wang wei ’ s so giddy he ’ s calling back the dead li bai du fu guys you ’ ve got to see this—autumn sun they ’ re suddenly hell-bent on learning hebrew in order to get inside the celebration which explains how they wound up where they are in my university library ’ s squashed domain poor guys it was hebrew they were looking for but they ended up across the aisle from yiddish— some library of congress cataloger ’ s sense of humor the world ’ s calmest characters and its most skittish squinting at each other head to head all silently intoning some version of kaddish for their nonexistent readers one side ’ s dead the twentieth century ’ s lasting contribution and the other ’ s insufficiently learned to understand a fraction of what they mean the writings in the world ’ s most spoken language across from one that can barely get a minyan sick of lanzmen the yidden are trying to engage the guys across the aisle in some conversation how for example do you squeeze an image into so few words respectfully asks glatstein wang wei at first doesn ’ t understand the problem but then he shrugs his shoulders mumbles zen ... but please i myself overheard a poem in the autumn rain once on a mountain how do you do it i believe it ’ s called a psalm glatstein ’ s cronies all crack up in unison okay groise macher give him an answer but glatstein dons his yarmulke who knew he had one and starts the introduction to the morning prayer pisukei di zimrah psalm by psalm wang wei is spellbound the stacks ’ stale air suddenly a veritable balm and i ’ m so touched by these amazing goings-on that i ’ ve forgotten all about the autumn staring straight at me still alive still golden what ’ s gold anyway compared to poetry a trick of chlorophyll a trick of sun true it was something my changing tree with its perfect complement a crimson vine both thrown into panic by a steller ’ s jay but it ’ s hard to shake the habit of digression wandering has always been my people ’ s way whether we ’ re in a desert or narration it ’ s too late to emulate wang wei and his solitary years on that one mountain though i ’ d love to say what i set out to say just once next autumn maybe what ’ s the occasion glatstein will shout over to me from the bookcase that is if he ’ s paying any attention and finally i ’ ll look him in the face quick out the window yankev it ’ s here again
mothers of america let your kids go to the movies get them out of the house so they won ’ t know what you ’ re up to it ’ s true that fresh air is good for the body but what about the soul that grows in darkness embossed by silvery images and when you grow old as grow old you must they won ’ t hate you they won ’ t criticize you they won ’ t know they ’ ll be in some glamorous country they first saw on a saturday afternoon or playing hookey they may even be grateful to you for their first sexual experience which only cost you a quarter and didn ’ t upset the peaceful home they will know where candy bars come from and gratuitous bags of popcorn as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it ’ s over with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the heaven on earth bldg near the williamsburg bridge oh mothers you will have made the little tykes so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies they won ’ t know the difference and if somebody does it ’ ll be sheer gravy and they ’ ll have been truly entertained either way instead of hanging around the yard or up in their room hating you prematurely since you won ’ t have done anything horribly mean yet except keeping them from the darker joys it ’ s unforgivable the latter so don ’ t blame me if you won ’ t take this advice and the family breaks up and your children grow old and blind in front of a tv set seeing movies you wouldn ’ t let them see when they were young
do you know what ’ s the unluckiest thing in the world a differential grasshopper said to me i paused i put down the diesel grinder i ’ d been trying to fix i turned off the stealth bomber i faded away from the faded away pedals i put up finely embroidered silk panels over the faces of the statues i pulled the green vacillating amplifier into the hallway i swiveled seven of the chains and loosened the bolts in the balcony i went into the barn to unlace the cattle and overturn the empty buckets i put the white flag on the mailbox i cut the telephone wires i fed the ducks better than i usually feed them i adjusted the faucets so they ’ d drip a little i waved at old mr. wiley with his smokeless pipe and his manpowered plough across the field i moved a claypot off of a narrow ledge i taped the key to the bulldozer to the roof of the canopy i took the cup of auger bits away from the rabbit hutch i put a padlock on the children ’ s playhouse i picked up a stick by the sideyard gate i broke it over my knee i went to the well to fill a stone pitcher with cool water i let the donkey the goats go i took a ladder to the hayloft and took down a suitcase i could see across the valley down to the river from up there

whose woods these are i think i know ... the landings had gone wrong white silk like shrouds covered the woods the trees had trapped the flimsy fabric in their web—everywhere the harnessed bodies hung—helpless treading air like water we thought to float down easily—a simple thing like coming home feet first a welcome from the waiting fields a gentle fall in clover we hadn ’ t counted on this wilderness the gusts of wind that took us over we were surprised by the tenacity of branching wood its reach and how impenetrable the place we left and thought we knew could be sometimes now as we sway unwilling pendulums that mark the time we still can dream someone will come and cut us down there is nothing here but words the calls we try the dark with—hoping for a human ear response a rescue party but all we hear is other voices like our own other bodies tangled in the lines the repetition of a cry from every tree i can ’ t help you help me

the day is fresh-washed and fair and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air the sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white it cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel and cracks it to bright light little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance dance and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling a stir of my finger sets them whirring reeling i move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar i lie back and laugh and let the green-white water the sun-flawed beryl water flow over me the day is almost too bright to bear the green water covers me from the too bright day i will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots the sky is blue and high a crow flaps by the window and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air

we stripped in the first warm spring night and ran down into the detroit river to baptize ourselves in the brine of car parts dead fish stolen bicycles melted snow i remember going under hand in hand with a polish highschool girl i 'd never seen before and the cries our breath made caught at the same time on the cold and rising through the layers of darkness into the final moonless atmosphere that was this world the girl breaking the surface after me and swimming out on the starless waters towards the lights of jefferson ave. and the stacks of the old stove factory unwinking turning at last to see no island at all but a perfect calm dark as far as there was sight and then a light and another riding low out ahead to bring us home ore boats maybe or smokers walking alone back panting to the gray coarse beach we did n't dare fall on the damp piles of clothes and dressing side by side in silence to go back where we came from
what say the bells of san blas to the ships that southward pass from the harbor of mazatlan to them it is nothing more than the sound of surf on the shore — nothing more to master or man but to me a dreamer of dreams to whom what is and what seems are often one and the same — the bells of san blas to me have a strange wild melody and are something more than a name for bells are the voice of the church they have tones that touch and search the hearts of young and old one sound to all yet each lends a meaning to their speech and the meaning is manifold they are a voice of the past of an age that is fading fast of a power austere and grand when the flag of spain unfurled its folds o'er this western world and the priest was lord of the land the chapel that once looked down on the little seaport town has crumbled into the dust and on oaken beams below the bells swing to and fro and are green with mould and rust `` is then the old faith dead '' they say `` and in its stead is some new faith proclaimed that we are forced to remain naked to sun and rain unsheltered and ashamed `` once in our tower aloof we rang over wall and roof our warnings and our complaints and round about us there the white doves filled the air like the white souls of the saints `` the saints ah have they grown forgetful of their own are they asleep or dead that open to the sky their ruined missions lie no longer tenanted `` oh bring us back once more the vanished days of yore when the world with faith was filled bring back the fervid zeal the hearts of fire and steel the hands that believe and build `` then from our tower again we will send over land and main our voices of command like exiled kings who return to their thrones and the people learn that the priest is lord of the land '' o bells of san blas in vain ye call back the past again the past is deaf to your prayer out of the shadows of night the world rolls into light it is daybreak everywhere
she was thinner with a mannered gauntness as she paused just inside the double glass doors to survey the room silvery cape billowing dramatically behind her what ’ s this i thought lifting a hand until she nodded and started across the parquet that ’ s when i saw she was dressed all in gray from a kittenish cashmere skirt and cowl down to the graphite signature of her shoes “ sorry i ’ m late ” she panted though she wasn ’ t sliding into the chair her cape tossed off in a shudder of brushed steel we kissed then i leaned back to peruse my blighted child this wary aristocratic mole “ how ’ s business ” i asked and hazarded a motherly smile to keep from crying out are you content to conduct your life as a cliché and what ’ s worse an anachronism the brooding artist ’ s demimonde near the rue princesse they had opened a gallery cum souvenir shop which featured fuzzy off-color monets next to his acrylics no doubt plus bearded african drums and the occasional miniature gargoyle from notre dame the great artist had carved at breakfast with a pocket knife “ tourists love us the parisians of course ” — she blushed— “ are amused though not without a certain admiration ... ” the chateaubriand arrived on a bone-white plate smug and absolute in its fragrant crust a black plug steaming like the heart plucked from the chest of a worthy enemy one touch with her fork sent pink juices streaming “ admiration for what ” wine a bloody pinot noir brought color to her cheeks “ why the aplomb with which we ’ ve managed to support our art ” —meaning he ’ d convinced her to pose nude for his appalling canvases faintly futuristic landscapes strewn with carwrecks and bodies being chewed by rabid cocker spaniels “ i ’ d like to come by the studio ” i ventured “ and see the new stuff. ” “ yes if you wish ... ” a delicate rebuff before the warning “ he dresses all in black now me he drapes in blues and carmine— and even though i think it ’ s kinda cute in company i tend toward more muted shades. ” she paused and had the grace to drop her eyes she did look ravishing spookily insubstantial a lipstick ghost on tissue or as if one stood on a fifth-floor terrace peering through a fringe of rain at paris ’ dreaming chimney pots each sooty issue wobbling skyward in an ecstatic oracular spiral “ and he never thinks of food i wish i didn ’ t have to plead with him to eat ... ” fruit and cheese appeared arrayed on leaf-green dishes i stuck with café crème “ this camembert ’ s so ripe ” she joked “ it ’ s practically grown hair ” mucking a golden glob complete with parsley sprig onto a heel of bread nothing seemed to fill her up she swallowed sliced into a pear speared each tear-shaped lavaliere and popped the dripping mess into her pretty mouth nowhere the bright tufted fields weighted vines and sun poured down out of the south “ but are you happy ” fearing i whispered it quickly “ what you know mother ” — she bit into the starry rose of a fig— “ one really should try the fruit here. ” i ’ ve lost her i thought and called for the bill
the little girl won ’ t eat her sandwich she lifts the bun and looks in but the grey beef coated with relish is always there her mother says “ do it for mother. ” milk and relish and a hard bun that comes off like a hat—a kid ’ s life is a cinch and a mother ’ s life “ what can you do with a man like that ” she asks the sleeping cook and then the old negro who won ’ t sit “ he ’ s been out all night trying to get it i hope he gets it what did he ever do but get it ” the negro doesn ’ t look though he looks like he ’ s been out all night trying everyone ’ s been out all night trying why else would we be drinking beer at attention if she were younger or if i were prince valiant i would say that fate brought me here to quiet the crying to sweeten the sandwich of the child to waken the cook to stop the negro from bearing witness to the world the dawn still hasn ’ t come and now we hear the 8 o ’ clock whistles blasting from heaven and with no morning the day is sold
you could drive blind for those two seconds and they would be forever i think that as a diesel truck passes us eight miles east of mission churning through the storm heedless of the hill sliding away there isn ’ t much use to curse but i do words fly away tumbling invisibly toward the unseen point where the prairie and sky meet the road is like that in those seconds nothing but the blind white side of creation you ’ re there somewhere a tiny struggling cell you just might be significant but you might not be anything forever is a space of split time from which to recover after the mass passes my curse flies out there somewhere and then i send my prayer into the wake of the diesel truck headed for sioux falls one hundred and eighty miles through the storm

you never wrote the small green book like the poems of edward thomas it was a book i dreamed but watching the green report of your heart on the monitor it came to me as i stood like one of the doctors in my cap and gown home where you 've lived like a bachelor at the far end of the house there is a green diary the book of the deer the bear and the elk with snapshots of julian and bob and harry old hunting friends dead as the game strung up on poles or drooped across fenders i think you are the only one left and still you fight to stay breathing the scorched air of the burn ward the sweet stink of your own charred flesh stepfather do n't go seventy-three years is not the end of the book the letters you never wrote because even before you blistered your hands the act of writing pained you it took four shots to bring it down your father never praised you rising from dinner that night he beckoned toward the woodshed where the skinned deer hung draped in burlap then he whipped you with a belt `` do n't ever bring home meat shot up like that one bullet is enough '' i saw you kill a running buck at three hundred yards with one shot it 's a brutal art that fathers pass to sons when the propane tank ignited you took the flaming cylinder in your arms like a lover and fought it out the door now you dream each night of the trailer burning my mother screams and beats the fire out of her hair she was not burned like you— twice and three times for your care now the deer are safe from us i have one photograph to add to our book a doe running through a field my best shot somewhere in the grass behind her a fawn is hiding you ca n't see it but it 's there waiting for its mother to draw us away later she 'll return and the two of them will be saved stepfather father be like the fawn

the lump on his neck that no collar could hide and the charity of his presence there in the neighborhood each fall door-to-door standing in the swept porches waiting for the housewives to answer the ugly pitiable treeman reddish and leathery from the sun his baseball cap pulled tight over his head the visor stiff as a beaver ’ s tail year after year the bowsaw with its wide teeth and the long-handled toppers were all that announced his trade and standing on the porch he advised nothing though he coughed and hacked covering his mouth with his sap-blackened fist and waited for the infrequent yes that sent him up the trunk and into the solid lap of the branches where he clipped and sawed the bony leafless rigging until the tree all torso—lung and heart ribs and hips and shoulders— stood like a knotted goblet in the yard a figure as in allegory of his own stunted self rooted alive my mother tried hard to convince us we were all children of god and that the sick and maimed the poor were creatures born to special destinies so unique we could not understand but who could understand pain ’ s redemptiveness and how it rarely seemed to translate into grace the poor were always poor the sick sick—just as the treeman ’ s goiter did not respond to treatment inscrutable part of god ’ s plan part of the unlovely element of love the humbling the pity the scar of violence— a craving too frightening to name or too tender the way the treeman bundled the trimmings in twine and hauled them to the alley and as if he counted it his real work leaned against the fence and with his fingers picked the dogged sap from the blade and with a file sharpened the teeth

like words put to a song the bunched tobacco leaves are strung along a stick the women standing in the august heat for hours—since first light— under the pitched tin roof barefoot and at their feet the babies bare-assed dirty eating dirt the older children hand the leaves from the slide three leaves at a time stalks upright three handers for each stringer and three more heaped canvas slides waiting in what little shade there is it ’ s ten o ’ clock almost dinnertime they pull the pails of cold lunch and mason jars of tea out of the spring when they see the farmer coming from the field their men stripped to the waist polished by sweat and tired as mules by afternoon the loose cotton dresses even the headrags are dark with sweat still their fingers never miss a stitch though they ’ re paid not by the stick but by the day and the talk—unbroken news of cousins and acquaintances— unwinding with the ball of twine a frayed snuff-twig bouncing on one lip the string paying out through their calluses the piles of wide green leaves diminishing until the men appear with the last slide and clamber up the rafters of the barn to line the loaded sticks along the tiers it ’ s friday the farmer pays with a wad of ones and fives having turned the mule out to its feed and water hung up the stiffened traces and the bit he checks again the other barns already fired crude ovens of log and mud where the crop is cured in that hot dry acrid air spreads a yellowing leaf across his palm rolls an edge in his fingers gauging by its texture and its smell how high to drive the fire his crew is quiet in the pickup truck—did you think they were singing they are much too tired to even speak can barely lick salt from the back of a hand brush at flies hush a baby with a sugartit and the man who owns this land is also tired everyday this week he ’ s meant to bring home pears from the old tree by the barn but now he sees the fruit has fallen sees the yellow jackets feeding there he lights a lucky frames a joke for his wife—he ’ ll say their banker raised a piss-poor field this year and she will lean against the doorjamb while he talks while he scrubs his hands at the tin basin with a split lemon and a pumice stone rubs them raw trying to cut the gummy resin that stubborn black stain within the green

stiff thick the white hair of the broad-faced father who leads his shambling son along cracked sidewalks by dusty glass half hiding goods never sold the son is the taller one but still a child not aware of his clothes of what expressions seize on his soft face his gait lolls loosely directed from some weak distant center scarcely devoted to any purpose but following along and looking thick lenses glint with watery blue his small eyes veiled and placid as far off as the milky august sky the father all the time glancing at him and talking as man to man seems to forget it would be better for this one to have been like all the rest he has his son still with him the others have grown up and gone away—but when he dies then what will happen to the boy even this thought is absorbed now in their ordinary errand men ’ s business grateful going out through the day talk with the owners the salesmen a mechanic in the scent of grease and sawdust of machined metal the sifting through tools and parts that flow spill gleam like seeds like sand—looking for what fits finding what will work afterwards to stop for food then walk back home down the clear streets when starlings hunting and restless before sleep and children are the loudest things with the dark foaming among maples glinting as it comes in

calmly we walk through this april ’ s day metropolitan poetry here and there in the park sit pauper and rentier the screaming children the motor-car fugitive about us running away between the worker and the millionaire number provides all distances it is nineteen thirty-seven now many great dears are taken away what will become of you and me this is the school in which we learn ... besides the photo and the memory ... that time is the fire in which we burn this is the school in which we learn ... what is the self amid this blaze what am i now that i was then which i shall suffer and act again the theodicy i wrote in my high school days restored all life from infancy the children shouting are bright as they run this is the school in which they learn ... ravished entirely in their passing play ... that time is the fire in which they burn avid its rush that reeling blaze where is my father and eleanor not where are they now dead seven years but what they were then no more no more from nineteen-fourteen to the present day bert spira and rhoda consume consume not where they are now where are they now but what they were then both beautiful each minute bursts in the burning room the great globe reels in the solar fire spinning the trivial and unique away how all things flash how all things flare what am i now that i was then may memory restore again and again the smallest color of the smallest day time is the school in which we learn time is the fire in which we burn
when the mule balked he hit him sometimes with the flat of a hand upside the head more often the stick he carried did its angry trick the mule ’ s job was to power the press iron on iron that wrung the sugar out of cane circling under the coarse beam attached to his shoulders and neck that mule of my childhood was black remained blackly obedient as round and round he made himself the splintered hand of a clock the groan and squeak of machinery chewing the reedy stalks to pulp each second delivering another sweet thin drop into the black pot at the center he hit him with a rag old headrag but the animal winced only with the thrash of a cane stalk itself—he squinted under the rule of that bamboo the sun was another caning on his black-hot flesh he was slow as the blackstrap syrup the boiled sugar made so true to the circle he dragged we hardly saw him we loved the rustling house of green cane blind in that field of tropical grasses whose white plumes announced the long season ’ s wait we yearned for the six-foot stem the eventual six pieces the machete sliced at the joints then the woody exterior peeled back lengthwise with a blade it was a black hand we waited for his job to lay bare the grainy fiber we chewed that juice on our tongues was his sweetness at work chester was his name he kept the mule
he my captor gave me a bisquit which i put in my pocket and not daring to eat it buried it under a log fearing he had put something in it to make me love him —from the narrative of the captivity of mrs. mary rowlandson who was taken prisoner by the wampanoag when lancaster massachusetts was destroyed in the year 1676 the stream was swift and so cold i thought i would be sliced in two but he dragged me from the flood by the ends of my hair i had grown to recognize his face i could distinguish it from the others there were times i feared i understood his language which was not human and i knelt to pray for strength we were pursued by god ’ s agents or pitch devils i did not know only that we must march their guns were loaded with swan shot i could not suckle and my child ’ s wail put them in danger he had a woman with teeth black and glittering she fed the child milk of acorns the forest closed the light deepened i told myself that i would starve before i took food from his hands but i did not starve one night he killed a deer with a young one in her and gave me to eat of the fawn it was so tender the bones like the stems of flowers that i followed where he took me the night was thick he cut the cord that bound me to the tree after that the birds mocked shadows gaped and roared and the trees flung down their sharpened lashes he did not notice god ’ s wrath god blasted fire from half-buried stumps i hid my face in my dress fearing he would burn us all but this too passed rescued i see no truth in things my husband drives a thick wedge through the earth still it shuts to him year after year my child is fed of the first wheat i lay myself to sleep on a holland-laced pillowbeer i lay to sleep and in the dark i see myself as i was outside their circle they knelt on deerskins some with sticks and he led his company in the noise until i could no longer bear the thought of how i was i stripped a branch and struck the earth in time begging it to open to admit me as he was and feed me honey from the rock
a ballad of the republic sung in the year 1888 the outlook wasn ’ t brilliant for the mudville nine that day the score stood four to two with but one inning more to play and then when cooney died at first and barrows did the same a sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game a straggling few got up to go in deep despair the rest clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast they thought if only casey could but get a whack at that— we ’ d put up even money now with casey at the bat but flynn preceded casey as did also jimmy blake and the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake so upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat for there seemed but little chance of casey ’ s getting to the bat but flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all and blake the much despised tore the cover off the ball and when the dust had lifted and men saw what had occurred there was jimmy safe at second and flynn a-hugging third then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell it rumbled through the valley it rattled in the dell it knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat for casey mighty casey was advancing to the bat there was ease in casey ’ s manner as he stepped into his place there was pride in casey ’ s bearing and a smile on casey ’ s face and when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat no stranger in the crowd could doubt ’ twas casey at the bat ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip defiance gleamed in casey ’ s eye a sneer curled casey ’ s lip and now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air and casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped— “ that ain ’ t my style ” said casey “ strike one ” the umpire said from the benches black with people there went up a muffled roar like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore “ kill him kill the umpire ” shouted some one on the stand and it ’ s likely they ’ d have killed him had not casey raised his hand with a smile of christian charity great casey ’ s visage shone he stilled the rising tumult he bade the game go on he signaled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew but casey still ignored it and the umpire said “ strike two. ” “ fraud ” cried the maddened thousands and echo answered fraud but one scornful look from casey and the audience was awed they saw his face grow stern and cold they saw his muscles strain and they knew that casey wouldn ’ t let that ball go by again the sneer is gone from casey ’ s lip his teeth are clinched in hate he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate and now the pitcher holds the ball and now he lets it go and now the air is shattered by the force of casey ’ s blow oh somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright the band is playing somewhere and somewhere hearts are light and somewhere men are laughing and somewhere children shout but there is no joy in mudville—mighty casey has struck out
my mind is shuffling its deck tonight slipping one card over another letting them all fall together at the corners the random hand of memory is dealing from the bottom of the pack first a bearded man emptying the dragon kiln then a woman whistling her face turned away as she opens the oven next a big cat six toes on each paw climbing up the yardpole last a pair of workhorses circling a tree until they grind themselves to dust there is no one home in the world tonight everyone is out of range the cradles are empty the boughs broken down trees go helter-skelter and the wheel is creaking on its shaft hit me i say to the dealer hit me again
the catalpa ’ s white week is ending there in its corner of my yard it has its arms full of its own flowering now but the least air spills off a petal and a breeze lets fall whole coronations there is not much more of what this is is every gladness quick that tree ’ s a nuisance really long before the summer ’ s out its beans long as a stick will start to shed and every year one limb cracks without falling off and hangs there dead till i get up and risk my neck to trim what it knows how to lose but not to shed i keep it only for this one white pass the end of june ’ s its garden july its fall all else the world remembering what it was in the seven days of its visible miracle what should i keep if averages were all
once in late summer the road already deep in twilight mixing colors with some straggly wildflowers i came to a village i did not know was there until i stepped into its narrow street admiring the prim white houses nestled among their veteran lofty trees i found myself in a tiny square with a little dawdl- ing fountain and a rickety tower its owlish clock absentmindedly counting minutes now and then and in the fountain the face of morning seemed to linger as though searching the air was fresh breathing out the fragrances of a recent shower i luxuriated in my senses like meeting unexpectedly a pack of friends years and years unthought of laden with all kinds of gifts then as i stopped to knock at the door of a house that had seemed occupied with happy noises a silence fell on it the light went out— and was it instant eyes like flakes ten thousand thousand flakes and all unknowing flurried round me wherever i turned i was met by the unmistakable accusation “ stranger ” i who had i thought begun here and who now required lodgings for the night was denied and from the start

the dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows pasted with colored squares past the man who leans into the phone booth ’ s red pagoda past crates of doves and roosters veiled until dawn fireworks complicate the streets with sulphur as people exchange gold and silver foil money to appease ghosts who linger needy even in death i am almost invisible hands could pass through me effortlessly this is how it is to be so alien that my name falls from me grows untranslatable as the shop signs the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle in the stairwell the corridor where the doors are blue months ajar hands gesture in the smoke the partial moon of a face for hours the soft numeric click of mah-jongg tiles drifts down the hallway where languid mai trails her musk of sex and narcotics there is no grief in this only the old year consuming itself the door knob blazing in my hand beneath the lightbulb ’ s electric jewel between voices and fireworks wind works bricks to dust—hush hush— no language i want to learn i can touch the sill worn by hands i ’ ll never know in this room with its low table where i brew chrysanthemum tea the sign for jade palace sheds green corollas on the floor it ’ s dangerous to stand here in the chastening glow darkening my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest of my life widening away from me waiting for the man i married to pass beneath the sign of the building to climb the five flights and say his chinese name for me he ’ ll rise up out of the puzzling streets where men pass bottles of rice liquor where the new year is liquor the black bottle the whole district is waiting for like some benevolent arrest—the moment when men and women turn to each other and dissolve each bad bet every sly mischance the dalliance of hands they turn in lamplight the way i turn now wai min is in the doorway he brings fish he brings lotus root he brings me ghost money

for a month now wandering over the sierras a poem had been gathering in my mind details of significance and rhythm the way poems do but still lacking a focus last night i remembered the date and it all began to grow together and take on purpose we sat up late while deneb moved over the zenith and i told marie all about boston how it looked that last terrible week how hundreds stood weeping impotent in the streets that last midnight i told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands how america was forever a different place afterwards for many in the morning we swam in the cold transparent lake the blue damsel flies on all the reeds like millions of narrow metallic flowers and i thought of you behind the grille in dedham vanzetti saying “ who would ever have thought we would make this history ” crossing the brilliant mile-square meadow illuminated with asters and cyclamen the pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting with the shifting wind over it and the blue and sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind i saw you in the sour prison light saying “ goodbye comrade. ” in the basin under the crest where the pines end and the sierra primrose begins a party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle the bottle stayed on its rock nobody could hit it looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake the pattern of human beings seemed simpler than the diagonals of water and stone climbing the chute up the melting snow and broken rock i remembered what you said about sacco how it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record traversing below the ragged arête one cheek pressed against the rock the wind slapping the other i saw you both marching in an army you with the red and black flag sacco with the rattlesnake banner i kicked steps up the last snow bank and came to the indescribably blue and fragrant polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit these are the things that will last a long time vanzetti i am glad that once on your day i have stood among them some day mountains will be named after you and sacco they will be here and your name with them “ when these days are but a dim remembering of the time when man was wolf to man. ” i think men will be remembering you a long time standing on the mountains many men a long time comrade

what you have heard is true i was in his house his wife carried a tray of coffee and sugar his daughter filed her nails his son went out for the night there were daily papers pet dogs a pistol on the cushion beside him the moon swung bare on its black cord over the house on the television was a cop show it was in english broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man 's legs or cut his hands to lace on the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores we had dinner rack of lamb good wine a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid the maid brought green mangoes salt a type of bread i was asked how i enjoyed the country there was a brief commercial in spanish his wife took everything away there was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern the parrot said hello on the terrace the colonel told it to shut up and pushed himself from the table my friend said to me with his eyes say nothing the colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home he spilled many human ears on the table they were like dried peach halves there is no other way to say this he took one of them in his hands shook it in our faces dropped it into a water glass it came alive there i am tired of fooling around he said as for the rights of anyone tell your people they can go fuck them- selves he swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air something for your poetry no he said some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground may 1978
for my father vivid and heavy he strolls through dark brick kitchens within the great house of esterhazy a deaf servant ’ s candle is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about the green kindling the wassail is being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles over thirty baked apples in a large bowl into the wassail young girls empty their aprons of cinnamon ground mace and allspice berries a cook adds egg whites and brandy the giant glass snifters on a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids the anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig stuffed with devonshire cream in the sinks the gallbladders of geese are soaking in cold salted water walking in the storm this evening he passed children in rags singing carols they were roped together in the drifting snow outside the palace gate he knew he would remember those boys ’ faces there ’ s a procession into the kitchens larger boys each with a heavy shoe of coal the pianist sits and looks hard at a long black sausage he will not eat before playing the new sonata beside him the table sags with hams kidney pies and two shoulders of lamb a hand rings a bell in the parlor no longer able to hide he walks straight into the large room that blinds him with light he sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries the simple sonata which he is playing has little to do with what he ’ s feeling something larger where a viola builds in air an infinite staircase an oboe joins the viola they struggle for a more florid harmony but the silent violins now emerge and like the big wing of a bird smother everything in a darkness from which only a single horn escapes— that feels effaced by the composer ’ s dream but he is not dreaming the composer is finishing two performances simultaneously he is back in the dark kitchens sulking and counting his few florins—they have paid him with a snuffbox that was pressed with two diamonds in holland this century discovers quinine and the sketchbooks of a mad sad musician who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside a critic he screamed here take the snuffbox i ’ ve filled it with the dander of dragons he apologizes the next morning instructing the landlord to take this stuff da ist der wisch to a publisher and sell it you 'll have your velvet garters pig the composer is deaf loud and feverish he went to the countryside in a wet sedan chair he said to himself for the piper seventy ducats he ’ d curse while running his fingers through his tousled hair he made the poor viola climb the stairs he desired loquats loquats with small pears ludwig there are spring bears under the pepper trees the picnic by the stone house the minnows could have been sunlight striking fissures in the stream ludwig where your feet are in the cold stream everything is horizontal like the land and living the stream saying “ in the beginning was the word and without the word was not anything made that was made but let us believe in the word ludwig for it is like the sea grasses off which with giant snails eat at twilight ” but then the dream turns to autumn the tinctures he swallows are doing nothing for him and he shows the physicians his spoon which has dissolved in the mixtures the chemist has given him after the sonata was heard the standing for applause over he walked out where it was snowing it had been dark early that evening it ’ s here that the dream becomes shocking he sees a doctor in white sleeves who is sawing at the temporal bones of his ears there is a bag of dampened plaster for the death mask and though he is dead a pool of urine runs to the middle of the sickroom a brass urinal is on the floor it is the shape of his ears rusting on gauze the doctors drink stale wassail they frown over the dead beethoven outside the same march storm that swept through vienna an hour before has turned in its tracks like the black caged panther on exhibit in the esterhazys ’ candlelit ballroom the storm crosses over vienna once more lightning strikes the opera house its eaves and awnings filled with hailstones flames leaping to the adjacent stables someone had known as thunder dropped flower boxes off windowsills someone must have known that at this moment the violins would emerge in a struggle with the loud combatant horns
our patron of falling short who became a prayer i used to sneak into the movies without paying i watched the stories but i failed to see the dark i went to college and drank everything they gave me and i never paid for any of that water on which i drifted as if by grace until after the drownings when in the diamond light of seven-something a.m. as the spring was tearing me up in cartajena only praying on my knees before the magnifying ark of the seventh st. hotel could possibly save me until falling on my face before the daughter of money while the world poured from the till brought the moment ’ s length against the moment ’ s height and paying was what i was earning and eating and wearing this to the best of my recollection my uncle said in 1956 moving against my father like a bear on fire as the evening of his visit killed the rum he ’ d come from alaska or some place like that the antarctic maybe and he left in a hot rage screaming by the door that nothing would save me from my awful father just as he my uncle had been saved by nothing thirteen weeks from then he died “ this family ’ s full of the dead ” my father told me i was eight i used to make excuses to join him in the washroom as he bathed in the mornings soaping himself carefully so as not to splash the automatic pistol wrapped in plastic he rested near to hand at a certain point the sun came through the blinds and shafted the toilet bowl filling it with light as he spoke of killing everyone often taking the pistol from its wrap and holding its mouth against his breast explaining that no safety lay anywhere unless he should shoot the fear that stood up on its hind legs in his heart such things were always on tv—i thought that one world merged in the next and i resolved to win the great congressional medal of honor to make a name on the stage and die a priest in the war the bullets yanked the fronds from palms and the earth ate them up like acid before our eyes when dead men hit the ground they came alive they spoke in tongues holding babies that came from nowhere in their arms we were all afraid of the earth my father ’ s fear turned it like a plow delivering dogs and bugs bright music and a feminine whispering of our names my comrades fled but i was healed by everything that happened the midnight rapid transit stations of hand grenades made moonlight as i moved from life to life getting off and shouting whatever the signs said getting on again received like lightning changing everything my body disappeared the enemy knew me as a ghost who dropped a shadow the size of night and turned the air to edges i am your grand companion of surprise big-time harbinger canceling everyone ’ s business in a constant dream of all the starring roles and franchises the great congressional medal of honor winners win wounded twice then decorated more than any other in my regiment i stood at home plate vomit on my blouse and whiskey in my blood and heard the dirt of my home town falling grain by grain out of the afternoon while everyone ’ s rahrahrahs affected me like silence the mayor handed me a four-by-four- inch cardboard box a colonel handed him i threw it at the vast face of the crowd screaming i wanted only the medal of honor … i lose the thread of my existence here i see me strange and drugged against my will telling my life story to a room traveling the aisles of an asylum out there in maine among the aborigines they must have set me loose or i escaped i see myself in a forest-bordered field unchanged and wearing my uniform— free yet somehow jailed by old desires and saying what a soldier says for home nothing comrades for you these hoarded rations with four monstrosities in uniforms like mine i pulverized guitars and wept for the merriment of many brothers when shadows lengthen and they lower down the american flag and close our government another country rises like a mist by garbagey coliseums on the warehouse side of town to listen to that rock and roll god speaking with the devil ’ s voice unbreathable air of manacles a storm to bless your multicolored lips with sperm we sundered them until they brought their bones forth from the flesh and laid them at our feet screaming their lungs shut tight as fists shedding their homes forever leaving name and tongue and mind and sending us their heads through the mails in the night we ran it past the edge we gave them something everyone could dance to— whatever is most terrible is most real— the bible fights the fetuses burning in light-bulbs the cunnilingual intravenous swamp of love three times i died on stage and the show went on while doctors snatched me back from chinatown with their machines we struck it rich without a repertoire without a name or theme we toured the land and eighty thousand perished we were real but not one company recorded us everywhere we went they passed a law we toured the land—sweet burning texacos the adrenaline darkness palpitates frantically the highway eats itself all night the radio ’ s wheedling bebop fails in the galactic soup near dawn the winnebago shimmers everything tastes like puke the eight-ball bursts nobody knows how to drink in this fuckin town … one night i heard our music end abruptly in the middle of a number and looked around me at a gigantic silence i felt the pounding saw the screams but all was like the long erasure of a wind calming and disturbing everything on its route through stunned fields of hay my bodyguards tried with huge gentleness to lead me off but i threw myself outside rolling through a part of town i ’ d never seen— the flat gray streets looked hebrew and the windows held out the paraphernalia of old age porcelain jesuses gesturing from the shadows of porcelain vases surrounded by medicines a rain began i strained myself to hear the trashcans say their miserable names but nothing at the brink of stardom high over the united states untouchable as god but better known i stumbled over streets that might ’ ve been rubber deaf as a cockroach finished as a singer brothers i spilled myself along the roads mold grew on me as i dampened in alleys i began in ignorance how could i know that whoever is grinding up his soul is making himself afresh that the ones who run away get nearer all the time look here or there it ’ s always the horizon the dull edge of earth dicing your plan like a potato does water break the light or light the water which do you choose what is or what is i painted myself black and let that color ride through virgins like the penises they dream of while their fathers sleep i lied i cheated like a shark i robbed the dead nothing healed me just as nothing healed my uncle of himself—but he was healed while i grew phosphorescent with a kind of cancer that i carried like a domino a tiny badge discovering me … oh please my love i want to rock and roll with you feel it feel it feel it all night like a shoe … ten years i wasted all i had and then ten years i lived correctly—held a job in a factory that made explosions where deafness was an asset i did well i never missed a day i polished late honed my skills received promotions—in the end i built explosions for atomic bombs forty-three i built myself which one of these days will deafen you as i am deafened i wrenched the fraternal orders with my tale of sorrowful delinquency—the elks the lions moose those animals they loved the crippled rock ’ n ’ roller with the heart wrung out as empty as his former mind and variously and often they cited me i walked the malls with an expanded chest took my sips with my pinkie cocked firing dry martinis at my larynx and yearning for the strength of soul it takes to suck a bullet from an actual pistol hating my own drained face as i intimidated mirrors or stood in a jail of lies before the eagle scouts an alarm clock going off inside an alarm clock in a lump of iron inside a lump of iron hating myself for having become my father at night i prayed aloud to god and jesus to place me on a spaceship to the moon— leaven i told them constantly my mind is tired of me and i would like to die take me to ground zero take me to ground zero where in the midst of detonation it is useless to demonstrate quod erat demonstrandum this was my ceaseless prayer until my lips were muscles and my heart could talk telling it over and over to itself until they fired me and drove me to the edge of things and dumped my prayer into the desert drinking cactus milk and eating sand i wandered until i saw the monastery standing higher and higher at first a loose mirage but soon more real than i was there i fell on my face and let light carry me into the world—just as my uncle told it nine million years ago when i was eight— and the prison of my human shape exploded my heart cracked open and the blood poured out over stones that got up and walked when it touched them high in the noon some kind of jet plane winked like a dime i saw it also flashed over the vast perfumed commercial places filled with stupid but well-intentioned people the wreckages and ambushes of love putting themselves across making it pay in the margins of the fire in the calm spaces taken across the dance-floor by a last romance kissing softly in a hallucination strewn with bus tickets and an originless music— and now death comes to them a little boy in a baseball cap and pyjamas doing things to the locks of the heart … this was my vision here i saw the truth of the horizon the way of coming and going in this life i never drifted up from my beginning i rose as inexorably as heat brothers i reached you and you took me in you saw me when i was invisible you spoke to me when i was deaf you thanked me when i was a secret and how will i make of myself something at this hour when i am already made never a famous hero a star a priest— my mind decides a little faster than the world can talk and what i dreamed was only the darker sketch of what i would become it ’ s 1996. i ’ m forty-eight i am a monk who never prays i am a prayer the pilgrim comes to hear me the banker comes the bald janitors arrive the mothers lift their wicked children up— they wait for me as if i were a bus with or without hope what ’ s the difference one guy manipulates a little calculator speaking to it as to a friend sweat is delivered from its mascara sad women read about houses … and now the deaf approach trailing the dark smoke of their infirmity behind them as they leave it and move toward the prayer that everything is praying the summer evening a held bubble every gesture riveting the love the swaying of waitresses the eleven television sets in a storefront broadcasting a murderer ’ s face— these things speak the clear promise of heaven
above a coast that lies between two coasts flight 902 turns west towards san diego milwaukee falls away the constant passenger removed from character and context resumes his california story gradually ascending reading farewell my lovely for the umpteenth time like a book above the world or below the noise i recall some houses halfway in the desert and how dry the trees all seemed and temporary even the tallest buildings looked with bungalows decaying in the santa ana wind and finally just how small it was and mean is it nostalgia for the limited that makes the days go quickly tracing out their spirals of diminishing concern like all the boys who lived on westland avenue i learned to follow the trails through the canyon shoot at birds with a bb gun and dream of leaving what are books to me they seemed like mirrors holding up a vision of the social in which people beckoning from their inaccessible preserves like forgotten toys afforded glimpses of those evanescent worlds that certain minor writers —raymond chandler say or even rupert brooke— could visualize somehow and bring to life again and though these worlds were sometimes difficult to see once having seen them one returned to find the words still there like a part of the surroundings compliant to one ’ s will yet these are attitudes and each age has its separate store of attitudes its store of tropes— “ in grantchester in grantchester — ” that filter through its dreams and fill its songs hume tried to show that sympathy alone allows “ the happiness of strangers ” to affect our lives yet now and then a phrase echoing in the mind long after its occasion seems to resurrect a world i think i recognize and never saw for what was there to see some houses on a hill next to a small stream a village filled with people i couldn ’ t understand could anyone have seen the transitory sweetness of the georgians ’ england and the world before the war before the waste land years are secrets and their memories are often stories of a past that no one witnessed like the fantasies of home one builds to rationalize the ordinary way one ’ s life has gone since then words seem to crystallize that life in pictures— in a postcard of a vicarage or of a canyon wedged between the desert and an endless ocean— but their clarity is fleeting i can nearly see the coast from here and as i hear the engines and the bell chimes all those images dissolve and then i start to hear the murmur of that constant voice as distant from me as a landscape studied from an airplane a contingent person with a particular mind and a particular will descending across a desert westward over mountains and the sparsely peopled scrub beyond the city pocked with half-filled reservoirs and rudimentary trails with nothing waiting for me at the end — “ and is there honey still for tea ” — but isolated houses nestled in the hills
i went for a walk over the dunes again this morning to the sea then turned right along the surf rounded a naked headland and returned along the inlet shore it was muggy sunny the wind from the sea steady and high crisp in the running sand some breakthroughs of sun but after a bit continuous overcast the walk liberating i was released from forms from the perpendiculars straight lines blocks boxes binds of thought into the hues shadings rises flowing bends and blends of sight i allow myself eddies of meaning yield to a direction of significance running like a stream through the geography of my work you can find in my sayings swerves of action like the inlet ’ s cutting edge there are dunes of motion organizations of grass white sandy paths of remembrance in the overall wandering of mirroring mind but overall is beyond me is the sum of these events i can not draw the ledger i can not keep the accounting beyond the account in nature there are few sharp lines there are areas of primrose more or less dispersed disorderly orders of bayberry between the rows of dunes irregular swamps of reeds though not reeds alone but grass bayberry yarrow all ... predominantly reeds i have reached no conclusions have erected no boundaries shutting out and shutting in separating inside from outside i have drawn no lines as manifold events of sand change the dune ’ s shape that will not be the same shape tomorrow so i am willing to go along to accept the becoming thought to stake off no beginnings or ends establish no walls by transitions the land falls from grassy dunes to creek to undercreek but there are no lines though change in that transition is clear as any sharpness but “ sharpness ” spread out allowed to occur over a wider range than mental lines can keep the moon was full last night today low tide was low black shoals of mussels exposed to the risk of air and earlier of sun waved in and out with the waterline waterline inexact caught always in the event of change a young mottled gull stood free on the shoals and ate to vomiting another gull squawking possession cracked a crab picked out the entrails swallowed the soft-shelled legs a ruddy turnstone running in to snatch leftover bits risk is full every living thing in siege the demand is life to keep life the small white blacklegged egret how beautiful quietly stalks and spears the shallows darts to shore to stab—what i couldn ’ t see against the black mudflats—a frightened fiddler crab the news to my left over the dunes and reeds and bayberry clumps was fall thousands of tree swallows gathering for flight an order held in constant change a congregation rich with entropy nevertheless separable noticeable as one event not chaos preparations for flight from winter cheet cheet cheet cheet wings rifling the green clumps beaks at the bayberries a perception full of wind flight curve sound the possibility of rule as the sum of rulelessness the “ field ” of action with moving incalculable center in the smaller view order tight with shape blue tiny flowers on a leafless weed carapace of crab snail shell pulsations of order in the bellies of minnows orders swallowed broken down transferred through membranes to strengthen larger orders but in the large view no lines or changeless shapes the working in and out together and against of millions of events this so that i make no form of formlessness orders as summaries as outcomes of actions override or in some way result not predictably seeing me gain the top of a dune the swallows could take flight—some other fields of bayberry could enter fall berryless and there is serenity no arranged terror no forcing of image plan or thought no propaganda no humbling of reality to precept terror pervades but is not arranged all possibilities of escape open no route shut except in the sudden loss of all routes i see narrow orders limited tightness but will not run to that easy victory still around the looser wider forces work i will try to fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder widening scope but enjoying the freedom that scope eludes my grasp that there is no finality of vision that i have perceived nothing completely that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk
the wind may blow the snow about for all i care says jack and i don ’ t mind how cold it grows for then the ice won ’ t crack old folks may shiver all day long but i shall never freeze what cares a jolly boy like me for winter days like these far down the long snow-covered hills it is such fun to coast so clear the road the fastest sled there is in school i boast the paint is pretty well worn off but then i take the lead a dandy sled ’ s a loiterer and i go in for speed when i go home at supper-time ki but my cheeks are red they burn and sting like anything i ’ m cross until i ’ m fed you ought to see the biscuit go i am so hungry then and old aunt polly says that boys eat twice as much as men there ’ s always something i can do to pass the time away the dark comes quick in winter-time— a short and stormy day and when i give my mind to it it ’ s just as father says i almost do a man ’ s work now and help him many ways i shall be glad when i grow up and get all through with school i ’ ll show them by-and-by that i was not meant for a fool i ’ ll take the crops off this old farm i ’ ll do the best i can a jolly boy like me won ’ t be a dolt when he ’ s a man i like to hear the old horse neigh just as i come in sight the oxen poke me with their horns to get their hay at night somehow the creatures seem like friends and like to see me come some fellows talk about new york but i shall stay at home
absorbed in planting bulbs that work of hope i was startled by a loud human voice “ do go on working while i talk don ’ t stop ” and i was caught upon the difficult choice— to yield the last half hour of precious light or to stay on my knees absurd and rude i willed her to be gone with all my might this kindly neighbor who destroyed a mood i could not think of next spring any more i had to re-assess the way i live long after i went in and closed the door i pondered on the crude imperative what it is to be caught up in each day like a child fighting imaginary wars converting work into this passionate play a rounded whole made up of different chores which one might name haphazard meditation and yet an unexpected call destroys or puts to rout my primitive elation why be so serious about mere joys is this where some outmoded madness lies poet as recluse no what comes to me is how my father looked out of his eyes and how he fought for his own passionate play he could tear up unread and throw away communications from officialdom and courteous in every other way would not brook anything that kept him from those lively dialogues with man ’ s whole past that were his intimate and fruitful pleasure impetuous impatient to the last “ be adamant keep clear strike for your treasure ” i hear the youthful ardor in his voice and so i must forgive a self in labor i feel his unrepentant smiling choice and so i ask forgiveness of my neighbor
i or your woman the night was a bad one i only saw one other person out a big black man on muleback riding along the levee marking the water there was a lantern in his hand and what you could call a grim smile on the lips i shifted down gears rolled down the window turned the radio low and said “ say there man how goes it ” but he couldn ’ t hear me for the rain and the song on his transistor radio “ i don ’ t know ” he said “ but it ’ s raining raining to beat hell. ” said i “ do you think it ’ s going to quit ” “ friend i couldn ’ t tell you. ” when big water will you call everyman friend we said our goodnights went on by mule and flatbed truck wearing black rubber cold to the bone like divers from different ships meeting below all you can do is nod some of the times at least we spoke knowing that living anywhere near the river you speak when you can the only thing you try to hold is your liquor and we had none that bad night on the levee always down the road i looked up in the mirror and i ’ m sure he ’ d a done the same ii midnight i almost slid off once imagining this cloud was a pall and the moon was a body i don ’ t know who put coins over her eyes when i got to rampion ’ s ferry i thought i was the only one there i mean it was quiet except for the current the cables and the rain i got a piece of rope out of the back of my truck and wound it around the generator engine it kicked right off the first pull the yellow bug lights came on and i saw a body move under a purple blanket he cussed me out for waking him up pulling his old self up there was some kind of fish in the weave of his poncho other figures of snakes and birds too i didn ’ t mean to wake the awnry fellow up i wonder if i did a strange odor came from underneath him when he dragged out his towsack it didn ’ t smell of something burning but of something that was singed like the rain it didn ’ t let up “ are we going crosst it or not ” he told me in a voice half-blooded song iii some past twelve someone with a light rode up before i could see what all he was pulling from the burlap blue calling chalk you find in pool halls ivory tusks a stringer with rotten heads the good book and another i couldn ’ t pronounce— just as worn and one of those paperweight crystals that snows he had strummed the mandolin twice a couple of sounds blue as a fox in trouble in a snowdrift on a ridge like weeds burning underwater a few licks of silent fire when i recognized the lookout the ferry wasn ’ t more than a few feet off the bank so the mule made it aboard easy its hooves on the planks like a mad rough carpenter nailing driftwood together oh we made it across we didn ’ t exactly hit the dock on the head but we floated on down to vahalia ’ s landing we had a good time the foreigner played the mandolin the river reached its crest and the man on the mule and i drank way into the morning they heard us the ones on land “ we ’ re a floating whorehouse without noun women. ” and in the dead of night rain and all we motioned them on
rotting in the wet gray air the railroad depot stands deserted under still green trees in the fields cold begins an end there were other too-long-postponed departures they left finally because of well water gone rank the smell of fungus the chill of rain in chimneys the spot is abandoned even in memory they knew locking doors upon empty houses to leave without regret is to lose title to one home forever
the crowd at the ball game is moved uniformly by a spirit of uselessness which delights them— all the exciting detail of the chase and the escape the error the flash of genius— all to no end save beauty the eternal— so in detail they the crowd are beautiful for this to be warned against saluted and defied— it is alive venomous it smiles grimly its words cut— the flashy female with her mother gets it— the jew gets it straight— it is deadly terrifying— it is the inquisition the revolution it is beauty itself that lives day by day in them idly— this is the power of their faces it is summer it is the solstice the crowd is cheering the crowd is laughing in detail permanently seriously without thought

a mix of oils by matisse or maybe it ’ s actually the weather we love most the way it shifts and scatters over the state like radio waves bouncing off the face of the moon the one over there near yuba city rising over a backyard garden of onions tomatoes squash and corn the one with the spider scrambling through celery harvesting moths and mayflies from the web it has strung between stalks sometimes i wish i could harvest the weather reap it like wheat or rice store it in a silo announcing steady rain or clear skies on its sides when the prices rise i could ship hailstorms or santanas in orange crates make safeway go broke do something politically efficacious for a change but all i really do besides write these poems is allow my mind to wander while i drive there it goes down the arroyo through manzanita and mormon tea or there up the mustard and indian pipe on the hill might as well let it nothing but god and country on the radio now wolfman jack ’ s syndicated and the dodgers haven ’ t made it to vero beach i wish this road would turn or bend intersect with a spy movie some spanish galleon or maybe a chinese poem with landscapes in brocade mist wine and moonlight

mushroom-colored lives blue dun is the color of its neon the same as the throat feathers of a teal scudding over the marshes of merced it matches the purple mascara the gypsy woman wears matches the pools of velvet-blue darkness in her eyes her name is alma josephina and she designed the sign herself imitating the figure of her own hand the neon indicative of its natural aura that was twenty

fog and it ’ s too hot for shoes or shirts i ’ d like to take my hair off too peel it from my head dip it in a bucket of ice and wear it around my neck like a bandana 2. crickets attend the night add a falsetto drone to the sound of us pissing in the tumbleweeds 3. there ’ s a tastee-freeze in fresno a dub ’ s closed down jack-in-the-box keeps popping up and mcdonald ’ s owns the town 4. somebody ’ s drying tobacco leaves on the laundry line there see them furl and flap next to the nylons 5. a giant oak uncurls over the road sprinkles a fine yellow powder on the windshield the sun hits touches it off in a spasm of golden-red light vii body fender/body soul at the grill the indian girl with buckteeth and dimples serves us a round of coffee and sweet rolls we ’ re waiting for the guy at henley ’ s texaco down the street to find us a fan belt that ’ ll fit it ’ s early the sky ’ s still in the john shaving and the sports page has to wait to get in everybody ’ s grumpy we sit around jab at raisins with our forks and try to look as tough as the waitresss her name ’ s rita her brothers jump fires and pump oil in alaska her sisters string beads and make babies back on the res her ex is white a logger who threatened never to come back and didn ’ t she doesn ’ t hold any grudges that ’ s why she ’ s so nice why she pops her gum filling the salt and pepper shakers why she adjusts her girdle so we can see why the egg spot on her dress doesn ’ t show outside the sun eases up over the parking lot scrambles across the freeway and runs for cover behind a pile of pumpkin-colored clouds 99 starts shuffling its deck of cars and pickups getting set to deal a hand of nine-to-five stud we don ’ t watch this is redding and ain ’ t nothing thing going on besides the day shift alan says “ look there ’ s venus ” and points to a piece of light draining the sky i want to order a country- fried steak talk about the dodgers but there isn ’ t time lawson hums a few chords stirring the changes with his coffee spoon rita cruises back like a bus bound for reno starts dealing some ashtrays she says “ how ’ s it going boys ” i answer for all of us— “ hey rita it ’ s almost gone. ” viii pilgrimage to the shrine six hours since the paradise cutoff and running on empty no gas stations or rest stops no weigh station no cops just miles of straight road and a long double-yellow unrolling in front of us alan recognized nothing lawson pops the glove pulls out a penlight and fingers the map pronouncing a few mantras our headlights slide over a scarecrow made of tumbleweeds standing by the road he ’ s wearing a kimono a dark-blue stovepipe hat his shoulders cloaked in a wreath of chrysanthemums we pull over back up and he disappears into the pale- grey darkness it ’ s smoke we can smell it so somebody ’ s got to be close by but our eyes go blined fill with tears and ashes as we stumble down the off-ramp the smell of frying trout and steamed rice reaches us when we come to an old hermit dressed like the scarecrow crawls out of his barracks and brings us tea “ drink ” he says “ it ’ ll pick you up ” and so we drink feeling drugged soft blues in the key of sleep suffocates the air from up the mountain the sound of obsidian flaking in the wind clouds of black glass waltz around us we dress ourselves in shrouds of tule reeds stitched with barbed wire stained with salt and mud we refuse to cry we drift back to the highway holding our fists like rattles shaking them like bones ix confessions of the highway/the hermit speaks i know the rituals the spells of grapes the ceremonies of tomatoes celery and rice i know the color of wind dressed for fiesta and the names of carnivals in spanish and japanese i am familiar with the determination of campesinos who migrate up and down the stretch of the state in search of crops ready for harvest it ’ s all a dull ache in my back small cuts on the throats of my fingers and the alkali of a dry lake in my lungs for me the oracle of the giant orange always predicts good fortune yet it never comes true my stomach is full of sand and tar a little bit of paint a few crickets i stand in swampwater up to my hips and the stink of rotting figs escapes my armpits in small brown clouds scrub oak and tumbleweed sprout from my scalp make a small grove behind my left ear i don ’ t know why sparrows and starlings refuse to approach me to take the grass seed tucked in the cuffs of my trousers maybe it ’ s the stain of asphalt around my ankles this copper sheen of sweat on my back sometimes when the valley heat makes the bones in my feet start to hiss and burn the desire to escape comes over me again i can ’ t help it my arms pull down a few telephone posts my shoulders churn against the bindings i feel myself wanting to sit up begin to walk again and thresh my way across rice fields and acres of alfalfa for once i ’ d like to lift my face straight above shasta into the sky shout in unison with thunder roar with the assurance of santana wind leap out of these bonds of copper and steel slough off this skin of cement and walk south or north or even west into the weather and the sea
a new volcano has erupted the papers say and last week i was reading where some ship saw an island being born at first a breath of steam ten miles away and then a black fleck—basalt probably— rose in the mate ’ s binoculars and caught on the horizon like a fly they named it but my poor old island ’ s still un-rediscovered un-renamable none of the books has ever got it right well i had fifty-two miserable small volcanoes i could climb with a few slithery strides— volcanoes dead as ash heaps i used to sit on the edge of the highest one and count the others standing up naked and leaden with their heads blown off i ’ d think that if they were the size i thought volcanoes should be then i had become a giant and if i had become a giant i couldn ’ t bear to think what size the goats and turtles were or the gulls or the overlapping rollers —a glittering hexagon of rollers closing and closing in but never quite glittering and glittering though the sky was mostly overcast my island seemed to be a sort of cloud-dump all the hemisphere ’ s left-over clouds arrived and hung above the craters—their parched throats were hot to touch was that why it rained so much and why sometimes the whole place hissed the turtles lumbered by high-domed hissing like teakettles and i ’ d have given years or taken a few for any sort of kettle of course the folds of lava running out to sea would hiss i ’ d turn and then they ’ d prove to be more turtles the beaches were all lava variegated black red and white and gray the marbled colors made a fine display and i had waterspouts oh half a dozen at a time far out they ’ d come and go advancing and retreating their heads in cloud their feet in moving patches of scuffed-up white glass chimneys flexible attenuated sacerdotal beings of glass ... i watched the water spiral up in them like smoke beautiful yes but not much company i often gave way to self-pity “ do i deserve this i suppose i must i wouldn ’ t be here otherwise was there a moment when i actually chose this i don ’ t remember but there could have been. ” what ’ s wrong about self-pity anyway with my legs dangling down familiarly over a crater ’ s edge i told myself “ pity should begin at home. ” so the more pity i felt the more i felt at home the sun set in the sea the same odd sun rose from the sea and there was one of it and one of me the island had one kind of everything one tree snail a bright violet-blue with a thin shell crept over everything over the one variety of tree a sooty scrub affair snail shells lay under these in drifts and at a distance you ’ d swear that they were beds of irises there was one kind of berry a dark red i tried it one by one and hours apart sub-acid and not bad no ill effects and so i made home-brew i ’ d drink the awful fizzy stinging stuff that went straight to my head and play my home-made flute i think it had the weirdest scale on earth and dizzy whoop and dance among the goats home-made home-made but aren ’ t we all i felt a deep affection for the smallest of my island industries no not exactly since the smallest was a miserable philosophy because i didn ’ t know enough why didn ’ t i know enough of something greek drama or astronomy the books i ’ d read were full of blanks the poems—well i tried reciting to my iris-beds “ they flash upon that inward eye which is the bliss ... ” the bliss of what one of the first things that i did when i got back was look it up the island smelled of goat and guano the goats were white so were the gulls and both too tame or else they thought i was a goat too or a gull baa baa baa and shriek shriek shriek baa ... shriek ... baa ... i still can ’ t shake them from my ears they ’ re hurting now the questioning shrieks the equivocal replies over a ground of hissing rain and hissing ambulating turtles got on my nerves when all the gulls flew up at once they sounded like a big tree in a strong wind its leaves i ’ d shut my eyes and think about a tree an oak say with real shade somewhere i ’ d heard of cattle getting island-sick i thought the goats were one billy-goat would stand on the volcano i ’ d christened mont d ’ espoir or mount despair i ’ d time enough to play with names and bleat and bleat and sniff the air i ’ d grab his beard and look at him his pupils horizontal narrowed up and expressed nothing or a little malice i got so tired of the very colors one day i dyed a baby goat bright red with my red berries just to see something a little different and then his mother wouldn ’ t recognize him dreams were the worst of course i dreamed of food and love but they were pleasant rather than otherwise but then i ’ d dream of things like slitting a baby ’ s throat mistaking it for a baby goat i ’ d have nightmares of other islands stretching away from mine infinities of islands islands spawning islands like frogs ’ eggs turning into polliwogs of islands knowing that i had to live on each and every one eventually for ages registering their flora their fauna their geography just when i thought i couldn ’ t stand it another minute longer friday came accounts of that have everything all wrong friday was nice friday was nice and we were friends if only he had been a woman i wanted to propagate my kind and so did he i think poor boy he ’ d pet the baby goats sometimes and race with them or carry one around —pretty to watch he had a pretty body and then one day they came and took us off now i live here another island that doesn ’ t seem like one but who decides my blood was full of them my brain bred islands but that archipelago has petered out i ’ m old i ’ m bored too drinking my real tea surrounded by uninteresting lumber the knife there on the shelf— it reeked of meaning like a crucifix it lived how many years did i beg it implore it not to break i knew each nick and scratch by heart the bluish blade the broken tip the lines of wood-grain on the handle ... now it won ’ t look at me at all the living soul has dribbled away my eyes rest on it and pass on the local museum ’ s asked me to leave everything to them the flute the knife the shrivelled shoes my shedding goatskin trousers moths have got in the fur the parasol that took me such a time remembering the way the ribs should go it still will work but folded up looks like a plucked and skinny fowl how can anyone want such things —and friday my dear friday died of measles seventeen years ago come march

farewell sweet cooke-ham where i first obtained grace from that grace where perfect grace remained and where the muses gave their full consent i should have power the virtuous to content where princely palace willed me to indite the sacred story of the soul ’ s delight farewell sweet place where virtue then did rest and all delights did harbor in her breast never shall my sad eyes again behold those pleasures which my thoughts did then unfold yet you great lady mistress of that place from whose desires did spring this work of grace vouchsafe to think upon those pleasures past as fleeting worldly joys that could not last or as dim shadows of celestial pleasures which are desired above all earthly treasures oh how methought against you thither came each part did seem some new delight to frame the house received all ornaments to grace it and would endure no foulness to deface it and walks put on their summer liveries and all things else did hold like similes the trees with leaves with fruits with flowers clad embraced each other seeming to be glad turning themselves to beauteous canopies to shade the bright sun from your brighter eyes the crystal streams with silver spangles graced while by the glorious sun they were embraced the little birds in chirping notes did sing to entertain both you and that sweet spring and philomela with her sundry lays both you and that delightful place did praise oh how me thought each plant each flower each tree set forth their beauties then to welcome thee the very hills right humbly did descend when you to tread on them did intend and as you set your feet they still did rise glad that they could receive so rich a prize the gentle winds did take delight to be among those woods that were so graced by thee and in sad murmur uttered pleasing sound that pleasure in that place might more abound the swelling banks delivered all their pride when such a phoenix once they had espied each arbor bank each seat each stately tree thought themselves honored in supporting thee the pretty birds would oft come to attend thee yet fly away for fear they should offend thee the little creatures in the burrough by would come abroad to sport them in your eye yet fearful of the bow in your fair hand would run away when you did make a stand now let me come unto that stately tree wherein such goodly prospects you did see that oak that did in height his fellows pass as much as lofty trees low growing grass much like a comely cedar straight and tall whose beauteous stature far exceeded all how often did you visit this fair tree which seeming joyful in receiving thee would like a palm tree spread his arms abroad desirous that you there should make abode whose fair green leaves much like a comely veil defended phoebus when he would assail whose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air joying his happiness when you were there where being seated you might plainly see hills vales and woods as if on bended knee they had appeared your honor to salute or to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit all interlaced with brooks and crystal springs a prospect fit to please the eyes of kings and thirteen shires appeared all in your sight europe could not afford much more delight what was there then but gave you all content while you the time in meditation spent of their creator ’ s power which there you saw in all his creatures held a perfect law and in their beauties did you plain descry his beauty wisdom grace love majesty in these sweet woods how often did you walk with christ and his apostles there to talk placing his holy writ in some fair tree to meditate what you therein did see with moses you did mount his holy hill to know his pleasure and perform his will with lowly david you did often sing his holy hymns to heaven ’ s eternal king and in sweet music did your soul delight to sound his praises morning noon and night with blessed joseph you did often feed your pined brethren when they stood in need and that sweet lady sprung from clifford ’ s race of noble bedford ’ s blood fair stem of grace to honorable dorset now espoused in whose fair breast true virtue then was housed oh what delight did my weak spirits find in those pure parts of her well framèd mind and yet it grieves me that i can not be near unto her whose virtues did agree with those fair ornaments of outward beauty which did enforce from all both love and duty unconstant fortune thou art most to blame who casts us down into so low a frame where our great friends we can not daily see so great a difference is there in degree many are placed in those orbs of state partners in honor so ordained by fate nearer in show yet farther off in love in which the lowest always are above but whither am i carried in conceit my wit too weak to conster of the great why not although we are but born of earth we may behold the heavens despising death and loving heaven that is so far above may in the end vouchsafe us entire love therefore sweet memory do thou retain those pleasures past which will not turn again remember beauteous dorset ’ s former sports so far from being touched by ill reports wherein myself did always bear a part while reverend love presented my true heart those recreations let me bear in mind which her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find whereof deprived i evermore must grieve hating blind fortune careless to relieve and you sweet cooke-ham whom these ladies leave i now must tell the grief you did conceive at their departure when they went away how everything retained a sad dismay nay long before when once an inkling came methought each thing did unto sorrow frame the trees that were so glorious in our view forsook both flowers and fruit when once they knew of your depart their very leaves did wither changing their colors as they grew together but when they saw this had no power to stay you they often wept though speechless could not pray you letting their tears in your fair bosoms fall as if they said why will ye leave us all this being vain they cast their leaves away hoping that pity would have made you stay their frozen tops like age ’ s hoary hairs shows their disasters languishing in fears a swarthy riveled rind all over spread their dying bodies half alive half dead but your occasions called you so away that nothing there had power to make you stay yet did i see a noble grateful mind requiting each according to their kind forgetting not to turn and take your leave of these sad creatures powerless to receive your favor when with grief you did depart placing their former pleasures in your heart giving great charge to noble memory there to preserve their love continually but specially the love of that fair tree that first and last you did vouchsafe to see in which it pleased you oft to take the air with noble dorset then a virgin fair where many a learned book was read and scanned to this fair tree taking me by the hand you did repeat the pleasures which had passed seeming to grieve they could no longer last and with a chaste yet loving kiss took leave of which sweet kiss i did it soon bereave scorning a senseless creature should possess so rare a favor so great happiness no other kiss it could receive from me for fear to give back what it took of thee so i ungrateful creature did deceive it of that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it and though it oft had given me much content yet this great wrong i never could repent but of the happiest made it most forlorn to show that nothing ’ s free from fortune ’ s scorne while all the rest with this most beauteous tree made their sad consort sorrow ’ s harmony the flowers that on the banks and walks did grow crept in the ground the grass did weep for woe the winds and waters seemed to chide together because you went away they knew not whither and those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear with grief and trouble wrinkled did appear those pretty birds that wonted were to sing now neither sing nor chirp nor use their wing but with their tender feet on some bare spray warble forth sorrow and their own dismay fair philomela leaves her mournful ditty drowned in deep sleep yet can procure no pity each arbor bank each seat each stately tree looks bare and desolate now for want of thee turning green tresses into frosty gray while in cold grief they wither all away the sun grew weak his beams no comfort gave while all green things did make the earth their grave each brier each bramble when you went away caught fast your clothes thinking to make you stay delightful echo wonted to reply to our last words did now for sorrow die the house cast off each garment that might grace it putting on dust and cobwebs to deface it all desolation then there did appear when you were going whom they held so dear this last farewell to cooke-ham here i give when i am dead thy name in this may live wherein i have performed her noble hest whose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast and ever shall so long as life remains tying my life to her by those rich chains
as i stood upon london bridge and viewed the mighty throng of thousands of people in cabs and ’ busses rapidly whirling along all furiously driving to and fro up one street and down another as quick as they could go then i was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air and the river thames is a most beautiful sight to see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night and the tower of london is most gloomy to behold and the crown of england lies there begemmed with precious stones and gold king henry the sixth was murdered there by the duke of glo ’ ster and when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor st. paul ’ s cathedral is the finest building that ever i did see there ’ s no building can surpass it in the city of dundee because it ’ s magnificent to behold with its beautiful dome and spire glottering like gold and as for nelson ’ s monument that stands in trafalgar square it is a most stately monument i most solemnly declare and towering defiantly very high which arrests strangers ’ attention while passing by then there ’ s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry and at the foot of the monument there ’ s three bronze lions in grand array enough to make the stranger ’ s heart throb with dismay then there ’ s mr spurgeon a great preacher which no one dare gainsay i went to hear him preach on the sabbath-day and he made my heart feel light and gay when i heard him preach and pray and the tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor and many were standing outside the door he is an eloquent preacher i honestly declare and i was struck with admiration as on him i did stare then there ’ s petticoat lane i venture to say it ’ s a wonderful place on the sabbath-day there wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old for the ready cash silver coppers or gold oh mighty city of london you are wonderful to see and thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist ’ s heart with glee but during my short stay and while wandering there mr spurgeon was the only man i heard speaking proper english i do declare
under the fire escape crouched one knee in cinders i pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt cracked a square of window pane the gummed latch and swung the window crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room of canton elementary school once canton high where my father served three extra years as star halfback and sprinter behind a flashlight ’ s cane of light i climbed a staircase almost a ladder and found a door on the second nudge of my shoulder it broke into a hallway dark as history at whose end lay the classroom i had studied over and over in the deep obsession of memory i swept that room with my light—an empty blackboard a metal table a half-globe lying on the floor like a punctured basketball—then followed that beam across the rows of desks the various catalogs of lovers the lists of all those who would and would not do what until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row and i saw again after many years the name of my father my name carved deep into the oak top to gauge the depth i ran my finger across that scar and wondered at the dreams he must have lived as his eyes ran back and forth from the cinder yard below the window to the empty practice field to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully the long angular lines of his name the dreams he must have laid out one behind another like yard lines in the dull pre-practice afternoons of geography and civics before he ever dreamed of savo sound or guadalcanal in honor of dreams i sank to my knees on the smooth oiled floor and stood my flashlight on its end half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling and in that split light i tapped the hammer easy up the overhang of the desk top nothing gave but the walls ’ sharp echo so i swung again and again harder and harder still in half anger rising to anger at the stubborn joint losing all fear of my first crime against the city the county the state whatever government claimed dominion until i had hammered up in the ringing dark a salvo of crossfire and on a frantic recoil glanced the flashlight the classroom spinning black as a coma i ’ ve often pictured the face of the teacher whose student first pointed to that topless desk the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row their eyes meeting over the question of absence i ’ ve wondered too if some low authority of the system discovered that shattered window and finding no typewriters no business machines no audiovisual gear missing failed to account for it so let it pass as minor vandalism i ’ ve heard nothing and rarely do i fret when i see that oak scar leaning against my basement wall though i wonder what it means to own my father ’ s name
a man who ’ s trying to be a good man but isn ’ t because he can ’ t not take whatever ’ s said to him as judgement it causes him as he puts it to react his face and neck redden and bloat a thick blue vein bulges up his forehead and bisects his bald pate scaring his children but provoking hilarity at work where one guy likes to get his goat by pasting pro-choice bumper stickers on his computer screen while he ’ s in the john then gathers a group into the next cubicle to watch when he comes back he has talked to his minister and to his wife about learning how not to react to make a joke and he has tried to make jokes but his voice gets tense they come out flat so even his joke becomes a joke at his expense another thing to laugh at him about he has thought to turn to them and ask why don ’ t you like me what have i done to you but he has been told already all his life self-righteous goody two-shoes a stick up your ass they are right he has never never never gotten along he says nothing this time just peels off the bumper sticker crumples it gently places it gently by his mousepad to dispose of later properly comparing his suffering to christ ’ s in gethsemane spat upon and mocked his minister ’ s advice and tries a smile that twists into a grimace which starts the hot blood rising into his face this is what they came for to see dickhead the bulging vein the skull stoplight red and indeed it is remarkable how gorged it gets as if his torso had become a helium pump so except for him whose eyes are shut tight they burst into laughter together exactly at the moment cruelty turns into astonishment
i suppose so i was living in an attic in philadelphia it became very hot in the summer and so i stayed in the bars i didn ’ t have any money and so with what was almost left i put a small ad in the paper and said i was a writer looking for work which was a god damned lie i was a writer looking for a little time and a little food and some attic rent a couple days later when i finally came home from somewhere the landlady said there was somebody looking for you and i said there must be some mistake she said no it was a writer and he said he wanted you to help him write a history book oh fine i said and i knew with that i had another week ’ s rent—i mean on the cuff— so i sat around drinking wine on credit and watching the hot pigeons suffer and fuck on my hot roof i turned the radio on real loud drank the wine and wondered how i could make a history book interesting but true but the bastard never came back and i had to finally sign on with a railroad track gang going west and they gave us cans of food but no openers and we broke the cans against the seats and sides of railroad cars a hundred years old with dust the food wasn ’ t cooked and the water tasted like candlewick and i leaped off into a clump of brush somewhere in texas all green with nice-looking houses in the distance i found a park slept all night and then they found me and put me in a cell and they asked me about murders and robberies they wanted to get a lot of stuff off the books to prove their efficiency but i wasn ’ t that tired and they drove me to the next big town fifty-seven miles away the big one kicked me in the ass and they drove off but i lucked it two weeks later i was sitting in the office of the city hall half-asleep in the sun like the big fly on my elbow and now and then she took me down to a meeting of the council and i listened very gravely as if i knew what was happening as if i knew how the funds of a halfass town were being dismantled later i went to bed and woke up with teethmarks all over me and i said christ watch it baby you might give me cancer and i ’ m rewriting the history of the crimean war and they all came to her house— all the cowboys all the cowboys fat dull and covered with dust and we all shook hands i had on a pair of old bluejeans and they said oh you ’ re a writer eh and i said well some think so and some still think so others of course haven ’ t quite wised up yet two weeks later they ran me out of town
they lie in parallel rows on ice head to tail each a foot of luminosity barred with black bands which divide the scales ’ radiant sections like seams of lead in a tiffany window iridescent watery prismatics think abalone the wildly rainbowed mirror of a soapbubble sphere think sun on gasoline splendor and splendor and not a one in any way distinguished from the other —nothing about them of individuality instead they ’ re all exact expressions of the one soul each a perfect fulfilment of heaven ’ s template mackerel essence as if after a lifetime arriving at this enameling the jeweler ’ s made uncountable examples each as intricate in its oily fabulation as the one before suppose we could iridesce like these and lose ourselves entirely in the universe of shimmer—would you want to be yourself only unduplicatable doomed to be lost they ’ d prefer plainly to be flashing participants multitudinous even now they seem to be bolting forward heedless of stasis they don ’ t care they ’ re dead and nearly frozen just as presumably they didn ’ t care that they were living all all for all the rainbowed school and its acres of brilliant classrooms in which no verb is singular or every one is how happy they seem even on ice to be together selfless which is the price of gleaming
in the ditch half-ton sections of cast-iron molds hand-greased at the seams with pale petroleum waste and screw-clamped into five-hundred-gallon cylinders drummed with rubber-headed sledges inside and out to settle tight the wet concrete that dried and caulked became monarch septic tanks and across the ditch my high school football coach don compo spunky pug of a man bronze and bald all biceps and pecs raging at some “ attitude ” of mine he snipped from our argument about vietnam— i mean raging scarlet veins bulging from his neck he looked like a hard-on stalking back and forth— but i had started college this was a summer job i no longer had to take his self-righteous hectoring shit so i was chuckling merrily saying he was ludicrous and he was calling me “ college man ryan ” and with his steel-toed workboot kicking dirt that clattered against the molds and puffed up between us it ’ s probably not like this anymore but every coach in my hometown was a lunatic each had different quirks we mimicked beloved bromides whose parodies we intoned but they all conducted practice like boot camp the same tirades and abuse no matter the sport the next game the next battle in a neverending war ex-paratroopers and -frogmen at least three finally convicted child molesters genuine sadists fixated on the commie menace and our american softness that was personally bringing the country to the brink of collapse— in this company don compo didn ’ t even seem crazy he had never touched any of us his violence was verbal which we were used to having gotten it from our fathers and given it back to our brothers and one another since we had been old enough to button our own pants any minute—no guessing what might trigger it— he could be butting your face mask and barking up your nostrils but generally he favored an unruffled moralistic carping in which i happy to spot phoniness saw pride and bitterness masquerading as teaching in the locker room i ’ d sit where i could roll my eyeballs as he droned but across the ditch he wasn ’ t lecturing but fuming flaring as i had never seen in four years of football and it scared and thrilled me to defy him and mock him when he couldn ’ t make me handwash jockstraps after practice or do pushups on my fingertips in a mud puddle but it was myself i was taunting i could see my retorts snowballing toward his threat to leap the ditch and beat me to a puddle of piss “ you craphead you wiseass ” and my unspading a shovel from a dirt pile and grasping its balance deliberately down the handle and inviting him to try it had he come i would have hit him there ’ s no question about that for a moment it ripped through our bewilderment which then closed over again like the ocean if an immense cast-iron mold were dropped in i was fired when the boss broke the tableau “ the rest of you ” he said “ have work to do ” and grabbing a hammer and chisel don compo mounted the mold between us in the ditch and with one short punch split it down the seam

the students know the agenda when i step inside our classroom the powerpoint is loaded the student presenting her report stands poised to begin and so she does this day is her second try the first a wash due to our failed technology i ask do you think you will earn another chance each time error is out of your hands this day a new day she stands confident prepared for questions from her peers the one question she ’ s noted that i ask of them all — what is it that this artist has allowed you to achieve this day i forget the other questions i always wait to ask this day they ask no others just stare outside at the lot of parked cars play with the ends of their hair they want to hear voices that give them reason to listen they want the blare of car horn tires screeching without a final thud they want a lecture a formula that does it all a recitation of the method that always gets things done and one woman says it that she is sad and all of them nod and another says that she is angry too and how could they not indict and why won ’ t justice ever be served and why won ’ t anyone do anything to change the america in which we live and i look at my classroom — the brown the black and the white of my room — and i ask who it is that must make the change we need and they talk about the government they talk about the system they talk about our economics and our judges and our juries they and they tell me of their lives their fears their boyfriends and their fathers our illness and our poverty their rights and their desires how none of us are ever safe and the room becomes their last surrender while they wait for me to teach i say this is the part where you wait for me to synthesize your words then tell you what to do and every face grows hopeful just as we all did the night before before we knew what we ’ ve always known that knowing the truth doesn ’ t save us and i take a sip of water and tell them every true thing that i know — that they are the power who will save what needs saving then answer their next questions with more and more questions asking until time is up
sometimes you watch them going out to sea on such a day as this in the worst of weathers their boat holding ten or a dozen of them in black rubber suits crouched around the engine housing tanks of air straps and hoses and for their feet enormous flippers the bow with such a load on board hammers through the whitecaps while they talk junonian girls praxitelean boys pelted on by bursting clouds by spray eventually heave the tanks upon their backs the boat drifts at anchor and down they go to the sea floor by the foggy headland at least you can presume they kick the flippers and plunge to where the water is more calm the cool instructors must keep eyes and ears open accidents out there they happen you might imagine scraps of cultural débris a broken pot a ring a cogwheel come up clutched in a palm and interesting a wave pattern in it the blade of a sword when a lucky diver breaks again the surface time time and again frigate and schooner cracked blown against the rocks holed below the water line even an inscription might now be coming up from those green deeps yet the divers do their silent thing on the sea floor expect only the sea a multitude of sand without an hourglass round somebody ’ s ankle idly it swarms a diver hangs by a thread of breath in solitude there some go down in all simplicity curious to have tales to tell and who knows what they learn just might long after this be usable
driving through hot brushy country in the late autumn i saw a hawk crucified on a barbed-wire fence i guess as a kind of advertisement to other hawks saying from the pages of a leading women ’ s magazine “ she ’ s beautiful but burn all the maps to your body i ’ m not here of my own choosing ”
at first he seemed a child dirt on his lip and the sun lighting up his hair behind him all around us the hesitation of year-rounders who know the warmer air will bring crowds no one goes to their therapist to talk about how happy they are but soon i ’ d be back in the dugout telling my batting coach how the view outside my igloo seemed to be changing as if the night sky were all the light there is now like two babies reaching through the watery air to touch soft fingers to soft forehead like blind fish sensing a familiar fluttering in the waves slowly by instinct we became aware off-field outside the park beyond the gates something was burning the smell was everywhere
when the fire bell rang its two short one long electric signal the boys closest to the wall of windows had to raise the blinds and close the sashes and then join the last of our line as it snaked out the classroom onto the field of asphalt where we stood grade-by-grade until the principal appeared with her gold timex we learned early that catastrophe must always be attended in silence that death prefers us orderly and ordered and that rules will save us from the chaos of our fear so that even if we die we die together which was the calm almost consoling thought i had each time the yellow c.d siren wailed and we would tuck ourselves beneath our sturdy desktops eyes averted from the windows we ’ d wait for the drill to pass or until the nun ’ s rosary no longer clicked and we could hear her struggling to free herself from the leg-well of her desk and then her call for us to rise and like herself brush off the dust gathered on our clothes and then the lessons resumed no thought of how easily we interred ourselves though at home each would dream the mushroom cloud the white cap of apocalypse whose funnel stem sucked glass from windows air from lungs and made all these rehearsals the sad and hollow gestures that they were for we knew it in our bones that we would die curled in a last defense— head on knees arms locked around legs— the way i ’ ve seen it since in nursing homes and hospices forms bedsheets can ’ t hide as if in death the body takes on the soul ’ s compact shape acrobatic posed to tumble free of the desktop or bed and join the expanse and wide scatter of debris
he has five children i ’ m papa to a hundred pencils i bought the chair he sat in from a book of chairs staplers and spikes that let me play vlad the impaler with invading memos when i said i have to lay you off a parallel universe was born in his face one where flesh is a loose shirt taken to the river and beaten against rocks just by opening my mouth i destroyed his faith he ’ s a man who can think honey-glazed ham and act out the thought with plastic or bills we sat i stared at my hands he stared at the wall staring at my hands i said other things about the excellent work he ’ d done and the cycles of business which are like the roller-coaster thoughts of an oscilloscope all this time i saw the eyes of his wife which had always been brown like almonds but were now brown like the crust of bread we walked to the door i shook his hand felt the bones pretending to be strong on his way home there was a happy song because de sade invented radio the window was open he saw delphinium but couldn ’ t remember the name i can only guess maybe at each exit that could have led his body to tempe to mars he was tempted to forget his basketball team of sons or that he ever liked helping his wife clean carrots the silver sink turning orange running ’ s natural to most animals who aren ’ t part of a lecture series on nature ’ s dead ends when i told him i saw he was looking for a place in his brain to hide his brain i tried that later with beer it worked until i stood at the toilet to make my little waterfall and thought of him pushing back from a bar to go make the same noise
lie down—lie down —my noble hound that joyful bark give o ’ er it wakes the lonely echoes round but rouses me no more— thy lifted ears thy swelling chest thy eyes so keenly bright no longer kindle in my breast the thrill of fierce delight when following thee on foaming steed my eager soul outstripped thy speed— lie down—lie down—my faithful hound and watch this night by me for thee again the horn shall sound by mountain stream and tree and thou along the forest glade shall track the flying deer when cold and silent i am laid in chill oblivion here another voice shall cheer thee on and glory when the chase is won lie down—lie down —my gallant hound thy master ’ s life is sped go—couch thee on the dewy ground— ’ tis thine to watch the dead but when the blush of early day is kindling up the sky then speed thee faithful friend away and to thy mistress hie and guide her to this lonely spot though my closed eyes behold her not— lie down—lie down —my trusty hound death comes and we must part— in my dull ear strange murmurs sound— more faintly throbs my heart the many twinkling lights of heaven scarce glimmer in the blue— chill round me falls the breath of even cold on my brow the dew earth stars and heavens are lost to sight— the chase is o ’ er —brave friend good night —
gaily bedight a gallant knight in sunshine and in shadow had journeyed long singing a song in search of eldorado but he grew old— this knight so bold— and o ’ er his heart a shadow— fell as he found no spot of ground that looked like eldorado and as his strength failed him at length he met a pilgrim shadow— ‘ shadow ’ said he ‘ where can it be— this land of eldorado ’ ‘ over the mountains of the moon down the valley of the shadow ride boldly ride ’ the shade replied — ‘ if you seek for eldorado ’
i love sweets — heaven would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream ... but my true self is thin all profile and effortless gestures the sort of blond elegant girl whose body is the image of her soul —my doctors tell me i must give up this ideal but i will not ... can not only to my husband i ’ m not simply a “ case. ” but he is a fool he married meat and thought it was a wife why am i a girl i ask my doctors and they tell me they don ’ t know that it is just “ given. ” but it has such implications— and sometimes i even feel like a girl now at the beginning of ellen ’ s thirty-second year her physical condition has deteriorated still further her use of laxatives increases beyond measure every evening she takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative with the result that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent diarrhea by day often accompanied by a weakness of the heart she has thinned down to a skeleton and weighs only 92 pounds about five years ago i was in a restaurant eating alone with a book i was not married and often did that ... —i ’ d turn down dinner invitations so i could eat alone i ’ d allow myself two pieces of bread with butter at the beginning and three scoops of vanilla ice cream at the end — sitting there alone with a book both in the book and out of it waited on idly watching people — when an attractive young man and woman both elegantly dressed sat next to me she was beautiful— with sharp clear features a good bone structure— if she took her make-up off in front of you rubbing cold cream again and again across her skin she still would be beautiful— more beautiful and he — i couldn ’ t remember when i had seen a man so attractive i didn ’ t know why he was almost a male version of her — i had the sudden mad notion that i wanted to be his lover ... —were they married were they lovers they didn ’ t wear wedding rings their behavior was circumspect they discussed politics they didn ’ t touch ... —how could i discover then when the first course arrived i noticed the way each held his fork out for the other to taste what he had ordered ... they did this again and again with pleased looks indulgent smiles for each course more than once for each dish— much too much for just friends ... —their behavior somehow sickened me the way each gladly put the food the other had offered into his mouth— i knew what they were i knew they slept together an immense depression came over me ... —i knew i could never with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth happily myself put food into another ’ s mouth— i knew that to become a wife i would have to give up my ideal even as a child i saw that the “ natural ” process of aging is for one ’ s middle to thicken— one ’ s skin to blotch as happened to my mother and her mother i loathed “ nature. ” at twelve pancakes became the most terrible thought there is ... i shall defeat “ nature. ” in the hospital when they weigh me i wear weights secretly sewn into my belt january 16. the patient is allowed to eat in her room but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal this she demonstrated with utmost realism ... her physical examination showed nothing striking salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides january 21. has been reading faust again in her diary writes that art is the “ mutual permeation ” of the “ world of the body ” and the “ world of the spirit ” says that her own poems are “ hospital poems ... weak—without skill or perseverance only managing to beat their wings softly. ” february 8. agitation quickly subsided again has attached herself to an elegant very thin female patient homo-erotic component strikingly evident february 15. vexation and torment says that her mind forces her always to think of eating feels herself degraded by this has entirely for the first time in years stopped writing poetry callas is my favorite singer but i ’ ve only seen her once— i ’ ve never forgotten that night ... —it was in tosca she had long before lost weight her voice had been for years deteriorating half itself ... when her career began of course she was fat enormous— in the early photographs sometimes i almost don ’ t recognize her ... the voice too then was enormous— healthy robust subtle but capable of crude effects even vulgar almost out of high spirits too much health ... but soon she felt that she must lose weight — that all she was trying to express was obliterated by her body buried in flesh— abruptly within four months she lost at least sixty pounds ... —the gossip in milan was that callas had swallowed a tapeworm but of course she hadn ’ t the tapeworm was her soul ... —how her soul uncompromising insatiable must have loved eating the flesh from her bones revealing this extraordinarily mercurial fragile masterly creature ... —but irresistibly nothing stopped there the huge voice also began to change at first it simply diminished in volume in size then the top notes became shrill unreliable—at last usually not there at all ... —no one knows why perhaps her mind ravenous still insatiable sensed that to struggle with the shreds of a voice must make her artistry subtler more refined more capable of expressing humiliation rage betrayal ... —perhaps the opposite perhaps her spirit loathed the unending struggle to embody itself to manifest itself on a stage whose mechanics and suffocating customs seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit ... —i know that in tosca in the second act when humiliated hounded by scarpia she sang vissi d ’ arte — “ i lived for art ” — and in torment bewilderment at the end she asks with a voice reaching harrowingly for the notes “ art has repaid me like this ” i felt i was watching autobiography— an art skill virtuosity miles distant from the usual soprano ’ s athleticism — the usual musician ’ s dream of virtuosity without content ... —i wonder what she feels now listening to her recordings for they have already within a few years begun to date ... whatever they express they express through the style of a decade and a half— a style she helped create ... —she must know that now she probably would not do a trill in exactly that way — that the whole sound atmosphere dramaturgy of her recordings have just slightly become those of the past ... —is it bitter does her soul tell her that she was an idiot ever to think anything material wholly could satisfy ... —perhaps it says the only way to escape the history of styles is not to have a body when i open my eyes in the morning my great mystery stands before me ... —i know that i am intelligent therefore the inability not to fear food day-and-night this unending hunger ten minutes after i have eaten ... a childish dread of eating hunger which can have no cause — half my mind says that all this is demeaning ... bread for days on end drives all real thought from my brain ... —then i think no the ideal of being thin conceals the ideal not to have a body— which is not trivial ... this wish seems now as much a “ given ” of my existence as the intolerable fact that i am dark-complexioned big-boned and once weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds ... —but then i think no that ’ s too simple — without a body who can know himself at all only by acting choosing rejecting have i made myself— discovered who and what ellen can be ... —but then again i think no this i is anterior to name gender action fashion matter itself — ... trying to stop my hunger with food is like trying to appease thirst with ink march 30. result of the consultation both gentlemen agree completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than i. all three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis and that no definitely reliable therapy is possible we therefore resolved to give in to the patient ’ s demand for discharge the train-ride yesterday was far worse than i expected ... in our compartment were ordinary people a student a woman her child — they had ordinary bodies pleasant faces but i thought i was surrounded by creatures with the pathetic desperate desire to be not what they were — the student was short and carried his body as if forcing it to be taller— the woman showed her gums when she smiled and often held her hand up to hide them— the child seemed to cry simply because it was small a dwarf and helpless ... —i was hungry i had insisted that my husband not bring food ... after about thirty minutes the woman peeled an orange to quiet the child she put a section into its mouth— immediately it spit it out the piece fell to the floor —she pushed it with her foot through the dirt toward me several inches my husband saw me staring down at the piece ... —i didn ’ t move how i wanted to reach out and as if invisible shove it in my mouth— my body became rigid as i stared at him i could see him staring at me — then he looked at the student— at the woman— then back to me ... i didn ’ t move —at last he bent down and casually threw it out the window he looked away —i got up to leave the compartment then saw his face — his eyes were red and i saw —i ’ m sure i saw— disappointment on the third day of being home she is as if transformed at breakfast she eats butter and sugar at noon she eats so much that—for the first time in thirteen years —she is satisfied by her food and gets really full at afternoon coffee she eats chocolate creams and easter eggs she takes a walk with her husband reads poems listens to recordings is in a positively festive mood and all heaviness seems to have fallen away from her she writes letters the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to whom she had become so attached in the evening she takes a lethal dose of poison and on the following morning she is dead “ she looked as she had never looked in life—calm and happy and peaceful. ” dearest.—i remember how at eighteen on hikes with friends when they rested sitting down to joke or talk i circled around them afraid to hike

then the cicadas again like kindling that won ’ t take the struck match of some utopia we no longer remember the terms of— the rules what was it was going to be abolished what restored behind them the foghorn in the harbor the hoarse announcements of unhurried arrivals the spidery virgin-shrieks of gulls a sideways sound a slippery utterly ash-free delinquency and then the subaqueous pasturings inexhaustible phosphorous handwritings the frothings of their own excitements now erase depth wrestling with the current-corridors of depth ... but here up on the hill in town the clusterings of dwellings in balconied crystal-formation the cadaverous swallowings of the dream of reason gone hot fingerprints where thoughts laid out these streets these braceletings of park and government—a hospital—a dirt-bike run— here we stand in our hysteria with our hands in our pockets quiet at the end of day looking out theories stationary while the freight the crazy wick once more slides down— marionette-like its being lowered in— marionette-strung our outwaiting its bloody translation ... utopia remember the sensation of direction we loved how it tunneled forwardly for us and us so feudal in its wake— speckling of diamond-dust as i think of it now that being carried forward by the notion of human perfectibility—like a pasture imposed on the rising vibrancy of endless diamond-dust ... and how we would comply some day how we were built to fit and comply— as handwriting fits to the form of its passion no to the form of its passionate bearer ’ s fingerprintable i.d. or no to the handkerchief she brings now to her haunted face lifting the sunglasses to wipe away the theory—or is it the tears —the freight now all in her right hand in the oceanic place we ’ d pull up through her wrist—we ’ d siphon right up— marionette with her leavening of mother-of-pearl— how she wants to be legible how the light streaking her shades now grows vermilion which she would capture of course because that she has heard from the rumorous diamond-dust is what is required as also her spirit—now that it has been swallowed like a lustrous hailstone by her unquenchable body—suggests—the zero at the heart of the christened bonfire—oh little grimace kiss solo at the heart—growing refined tiny missionary in your brightskirted host scorched comprehension—because that is what ’ s required her putting down now the sunset onto that page as an expression of her deepest undertowing sentiment which spidery gestures tongued-over the molecular whiteness squared out and stretched and made to resemble emptiness will take down the smoldering in the terms of her passion —sunglasses on the table telephone ringing— and be carried across the tongue-tied ocean through dusk right through it over prisons over tiny clapboard houses to which the bartender returns exhausted after work over flare-ups of civil strife skeletons rotting in the arms of skeletons the foliage all round them gleaming the green belly-up god we thought we ’ d seen the last of shuddering his sleep off first fruit hanging ripe—oh bright red zero— right there within reach that he too may be nourished you know this of course what has awakened which we thought we ’ d extinguished us still standing here sword in hand hand extended frail over the limpid surface of the lake-like page the sleep-like page now folded and gently driven into its envelope for the tiny journey over offices over sacrifices to its particular address at the heart of the metropolis where someone else is waiting hailstone at the core and the heat is too great friend the passion in its envelope doors slamming traffic backing-up the populace not really abandoned not really just very tired on its long red errancy down the freeways in the dusklight towards the little town on the hill—the crystal-formation — how long ago was it we said that do you remember — and now that you ’ ve remembered—and the distance we ’ ve traveled—and where we were then—and how little we ’ ve found—aren ’ t we tired aren ’ t we going to close the elaborate folder which holds the papers in their cocoon of possibility the folder so pretty with its massive rose-blooms oh perpetual bloom dread fatigue and drowsiness like leavening i feel—
i asked my father “ would you rather die of cancer or a heart attack would you rather be executed or put in jail for life which would you rather be— a spy or a sentinel ” and he tried to answer honestly combing his thinning hair with his fingers thinking of something else at last he fell silent i ran out to savor the dregs of dusk playing with my friends in the road that led to the highway the ball flew up toward day and landed in night we chanted every other minute a truck summoned by our warnings brushed past in a gust of light the driver ’ s curses muffled by distance the oncoming wheels were the point of the game like the scores in chalk or the blood from scuffed knees that we smeared across our faces so when my mother called her voice was quaint and stymied and i took all the time in the world trotting home past tarped barbecue pits past names of lovers filling with sap past tentative wind from sprinklers then i was stunned to see my golden window where all faces hanging plants dangling pots were framed by night and dwarfed by a ravenous inward-turning light
they pay us time and a half and don ’ t dare catch us drinking we don ’ t insist don ’ t pass a bottle but each sips a private pint all sitting in the narrow room with our backs to the center each facing his work—router stain tray buffing wheel drill press— and with that sweet taste echoing in our bones we watch our hands make what they always made —rosewood handles—but now we smile in delighted surprise and marchesi brings envelopes that record a full day ’ s work though it ’ s still noon processions still fill the streets choirs loudspeakers bellowing hallelujah and we change into our finest clothes in the locker room admiring each other ’ s hat brims passing bottles freely until all are empty and at last we separate in the brilliant street each in the direction of a different tolling bell
for kwame dawes your scuttled pays floats—fiery—in the ether blazing it vomits smudge-smoke your mind chars black because you yaw—moth-like—too near flames you douse your dream-scorched brain with slave-sweat rum— the only gold you can own corroding your liver your anthem plays to gunfire when you think about it when you can breathe — after all the lies that frame nostalgia all the dead faces that occupy photographs all the slain lovers pitched into ditches your eyes itch and ache with water then dry— curling like dead leaves starving for gold fire
imagine a child from virginia or new hampshire alone on the prairie eighty years ago or more one afternoon—the shaggy pelt of grasses for the first time in that child ’ s life flowing for miles imagine the moving shadow of a cloud far off across that shadeless ocean the obliterating strangeness like a tide that pulls or empties the bubble of the child ’ s imaginary heart no hills no trees the child ’ s heart lightens tending like a bubble towards the currents of the grass and sky the pure potential of the clear blank spaces or imagine the child in a draw that holds a garden cupped from the limitless motion of the prairie head resting against a pumpkin in evening sun ground-cherry bushes grow along the furrows the fruit red under its papery moth-shaped sheath grasshoppers tumble among the vines as large as dragons in the crumbs of pale dry earth the ground is warm to the child ’ s cheek and the wind is a humming sound in the grass above the draw rippling the shadows of the red-green blades the bubble of the child ’ s heart melts a little because the quiet of that air and earth is like the shadow of a peaceful death— limitless and potential a kind of space where one dissolves to become a part of something entire ... whether of sun and air or goodness and knowledge it does not matter to the child dissolved among the particles of the garden or into the motion of the grass and air imagine the child happy to be a thing imagine then that on that same wide prairie some people are threshing in the terrible heat with horses and machines cutting bands and shoveling amid the clatter of the threshers the chaff in prickly clouds and the naked sun burning as if it could set the chaff on fire imagine that the people are swedes or germans some of them resting pressed against the strawstacks trying to get the meager shade a man a tramp comes laboring across the stubble like a mirage against that blank horizon laboring in his torn shoes toward the tall mirage-like images of the tilted threshers clattering in the heat because the swedes or germans have no beer or else because they can not speak his language properly or for some reason one can not imagine the man climbs up on a thresher and cuts bands a minute or two then waves to one of the people a young girl or a child and jumps head-first into the sucking mouth of the machine where he is wedged and beat and cut to pieces— while the people shout and run in the clouds of chaff like lost mirages on the pelt of prairie the obliterating strangeness and the spaces are as hard to imagine as the love of death ... which is the love of an entire strangeness the contagious blankness of a quiet plain imagine that a man who had seen a prairie should write a poem about a dark or shadow that seemed to be both his and the prairie ’ s—as if the shadow proved that he was not a man but something that lived in quiet like the grass imagine that the man who writes that poem stunned by the loneliness of that wide pelt should prove to himself that he was like a shadow or like an animal living in the dark in the dark proof he finds in his poem the man might come to think of himself as the very prairie the sod itself not lonely and immune to death none of this happens precisely as i try to imagine that it does in the empty plains and yet it happens in the imagination of part of the country not in any place more than another on the map but rather like a place where you and i have never been and need to try to imagine—place like a prairie where immigrants in the obliterating strangeness thirst for the wide contagion of the shadow or prairie—where you and i with our other ways more like the cities or the hills or trees less like the clear blank spaces with their potential are like strangers in a place we must imagine

with this rain i am satisfied we will be together in the spring seeds of water on my window glass transparent sprouts and rootlets in your backyard steady rain through the heavy dirt we dug in our shovels excavating some history of the tiny garden our blades cut through the design of a previous digger rotting boards rocks earthworms big as young snakes a tarnished spoon pink champagne foil from a party a palmful of blue feathers from a dead jay we dug and planted we intend to have a history here behind this rented house despite the owner there is a secret between us and the ground in the wet dirt our fleshy bulbs and the pink cloves of garlic are making nests of roots the fact of the garden has satisfied me all morning that we worked side by side your name round when i spoke it that my fingers worked in the dirt like rain the ground like a made bed with its mulch of leaves orderly full of possibilities acts of love not yet performed now the water ’ s slap on my window has made me think of something else suddenly what i don ’ t want to the way i wake up in the night think i ’ ve heard a gun shot the memory news story you told me a week ago the farmers south far south el salvador afraid to go into their fields what does their dirt look like i don ’ t know instead i see that some thing is being planted u.s. soldiers watching as others bury a dead hand arm head torso to be afraid to put your hand into the dirt to be afraid to go look at your ground that it has been cut like skin will bulge out like cut muscle that on a fair day there will be subterranean thunder then a loud continuous hiss of blood i wish i could see only the flowering bulbs voluptuous in the spring but what is planted is what comes in the fall plant stones in the winter the ground gapes with stones like teeth i hold to the plan we thought of small full of possibilities against despair us handing out sheets of paper thousands the list of crimes sharp thin papers delving up something in people in parking lots shopping malls what will come of this perhaps people to stand with us outside the buildings to say again not in my name words adamant as rock and actions here in the coldest months before soldiers move again in the fields to the south

when i wake now it ’ s below ocherous saw-ridged pine beams haze streaks all three windows i look up at the dog-eared glossy magazine photo i ’ ve taken with me for years it gets tacked like a claim to some new wall in the next place— bill russell wilt chamberlain one on one the final game of the 1969 nba championship two hard men snapped elbowing snatching at a basketball as if it were a moment one of them might stay inside forever i was with my father the night that game played on a fuzzy color television in a jammed fall river bar seagram beer chasers for hoarse ex-jocks smoke rifting the air a drunk called him “ tiger ” and asked about the year he ’ d made all-state guard— point man ball-hawk pacer something he rarely spoke of almost always with a gruff mix of impatience and shyness each year days painting suburban tract houses fighting with contractors followed by night shifts at the fire station followed by his kids swarming at breakfast and my mother trying to stay out of his way each of the many stone-hard moments between 1941 1969— they made up a city of granite mills by a slate blue river that town was my father ’ s life still is if he felt cheated by it by its fate for him to bear that disappointment he kept it secret that night when he stared deep into a drunk ’ s memory he frowned he said nothing he twisted on the stool and ordered this guy a beer whatever my father i have in common is mostly silence and anger that keeps twisting back on itself though not before it ruins often even something simple as a walk in the dunes at a warm beach but what we share too is a love so awkward that it explains with unreasoning perfection why we still can ’ t speak easily to each other about the past or anything else and why i wake this far from the place where i grew up while the wall above me claims now nothing has changed all is different
the week in august you come home adult professional aloof we roast and carve the fatted calf —in our case home-grown pig the chine garlicked and crisped the applesauce hand-pressed hand-pressed the greengage wine nothing is cost-effective here the peas the beets the lettuces hand sown are raised to stand apart the electric fence ticks like the slow heart of something we fed and bedded for a year then killed with kindness ’ s one bullet and paid jake mott to do the butchering in winter we lure the birds with suet thaw lungs and kidneys for the cat darlings it ’ s all a circle from the ring of wire that keeps the raccoons from the corn to the gouged pine table that we lounge around distressed before any of you was born benign and dozy from our gluttonies the candles down to stubs defenses down love leaking out unguarded the way juice dribbles from the fence when grounded by grass stalks or a forgotten hoe how eloquent how beautiful you seem wearing our gestures how wise you grow ballooning to overfill our space the almost-parents of your parents now so briefly having you back to measure us is harder than having let you go
my father knows the proper way the nation should be run he tells us children every day just what should now be done he knows the way to fix the trusts he has a simple plan but if the furnace needs repairs we have to hire a man my father in a day or two could land big thieves in jail there ’ s nothing that he can not do he knows no word like “ fail. ” “ our confidence ” he would restore of that there is no doubt but if there is a chair to mend we have to send it out all public questions that arise he settles on the spot he waits not till the tumult dies but grabs it while it ’ s hot in matters of finance he can tell congress what to do but o he finds it hard to meet his bills as they fall due it almost makes him sick to read the things law-makers say why father ’ s just the man they need he never goes astray all wars he ’ d very quickly end as fast as i can write it but when a neighbor starts a fuss ’ tis mother has to fight it in conversation father can do many wondrous things he ’ s built upon a wiser plan than presidents or kings he knows the ins and outs of each and every deep transaction we look to him for theories but look to ma for action
maybe a sin indecent for sure—dope the storekeeper called it everyone agreed that manuel lawrence who drank through the side of his mouth squinting and chortling with pleasure was hooked furthermore aunt brenda who was so religious that she made her daughters bathe with their panties on had dubbed it “ toy likker fool thing ” and so might i be holding the bottle out to the light watching it bristle watching the slow spume of bubbles die i asked myself could it be alive when they electrocuted edwin dockery he sat there like a steaming breathing bolt the green muscles in his arms strained at the chair ’ s black straps the little finger of his right hand leapt up but the charge rose the four minutes and twenty-five hundred volts of his death which in another month will be thirty-five years old so the drink fizzed with the promise of mixtures to come there it was if the hard-shell baptists of alabama are good and content that the monster has died so am i. i swallowed sweet darkness one thing led to another the usual life waking sometimes lost dried blood in the ear police gabbling in a strange language how else would i ever gauge how pleasure might end walking past midnight in the vague direction of music i am never satisfied
the child ’ s assignment “ what is a city ” all dusk she sucks her pencil while cars swish by like ghosts neighbors ’ radios forecast rain high clouds diminishing winds at last she writes “ the city is everyone. ” now it ’ s time for math borrowing and exchanging the long discipleship to zero the stranger the force that makes us what we study father and child writing in separate books infinite and alone
i cook was a captain of the admiralty when sea-captains had the evil eye or should have what with beating krakens off and casting nativities of ships cook was a captain of the powder-days when captains you might have said if you had been fixed by their glittering stare half-down the side or gaping at them up companionways were more like warlocks than a humble man— and men were humble then who gazed at them poor horn-eyed sailors bullied by devils ’ fists of wind or water or the want of both childlike and trusting filled with eager trust— cook was a captain of the sailing days when sea-captains were kings like this not cold executives of company-rules cracking their boilers for a dividend or bidding their engineers go wink at bells and telegraphs so plates would hold another pound those captains drove their ships by their own blood no laws of schoolbook steam till yards were sprung and masts went overboard— daemons in periwigs doling magic out who read fair alphabets in stars where humbler men found but a mess of sparks who steered their crews by mysteries and strange half-dreadful sortilege with books used medicines that only gods could know the sense of but sailors drank in simple faith that was the captain cook was when he came to the coral sea and chose a passage into the dark how many mariners had made that choice paused on the brink of mystery ‘ choose now ’ the winds roared blowing home blowing home over the coral sea ‘ choose now ’ the trades cried once to tasman throwing him for choice their teeth or shoulders and the dutchman chose the wind ’ s way turning north ‘ choose bougainville ’ the wind cried once and bougainville had heard the voice of god calling him prudently out of the dead lee shore and chose the north the wind ’ s way so too cook made choice over the brink into the devil ’ s mouth with four months ’ food and sailors wild with dreams of english beer the smoking barns of home so cook made choice so cook sailed westabout so men write poems in australia ii flowers turned to stone not all the botany of joseph banks hung pensive in a porthole could find the latin for this loveliness could put the barrier reef in a glass box tagged by the horrid gorgon squint of horticulture stone turned to flowers it seemed—you ’ d snap a crystal twig one petal even of the water-garden and have it dying like a cherry-bough they ’ d sailed all day outside a coral hedge and half the night cook sailed at night let there be reefs a fathom from the keel and empty charts the sailors didn ’ t ask nor joseph banks who cared it was the spell of cook that lulled them bade them turn below kick off their sea-boots puff themselves to sleep though there were more shoals outside than teeth in a shark ’ s head cook snored loudest himself one day a morning of light airs and calms they slid towards a reef that would have knifed their boards to mash and murdered every man so close it sucked them one wave shook their keel the next blew past the coral three officers in gilt and buttons languidly on deck pointed their sextants at the sun one yawned one held a pencil one put eye to lens three very peaceful english mariners taking their sights for longitude i ’ ve never heard of sailors aching for the longitude of shipwrecks before or since it was the spell of cook did this the phylacteries of cook men who ride broomsticks with a mesmerist mock the typhoon so too it was with cook iii two chronometers the captain had one by arnold that ran like mad one by kendal in a walnut case poor devoted creature with a hangdog face arnold always hurried with a crazed click-click dancing over greenwich like a lunatic kendal panted faithfully his watch-dog beat climbing out of yesterday with sticky little feet arnold choked with appetite to wolf up time madly round the numerals his hands would climb his cogs rushed over and his wheels ran miles dragging captain cook to the sandwich isles but kendal dawdled in the tombstoned past with a sentimental prejudice to going fast and he thought very often of a haberdasher ’ s door and a yellow-haired boy who would knock no more all through the night-time clock talked to clock in the captain ’ s cabin tock-tock-tock one ticked fast and one ticked slow and time went over them a hundred years ago iv sometimes the god would fold his wings and stone of caesars turned to flesh talk of the most important things that serious-minded midshipmen could wish of plantains and the lack of rum or spearing sea-cows—things like this that hungry schoolboys five days dumb in jolly-boats are wonted to discuss what midshipman would pause to mourn the sun that beat about his ears or curse the tide if he could horn his fists by tugging on those lumbering oars let rum-tanned mariners prefer to hug the weather-side of yards ‘ cats to catch mice ’ before they purr those were the captain ’ s enigmatic words here in this jolly-boat they graced were food and freedom wind and storm while fowling-piece across his waist cook mapped the coast with one eye cocked for game v after the candles had gone out and those who listened had gone out and a last wave of chimney-haloes caked their smoky rings like fish-scales on the ceiling a yellow sea of swimming circles the old man old captain-in-the-corner drank his rum with friendly gestures to four chairs they stood empty still warm from haunches with rubbed nails and leather glazed like aged serving-men feeding a king ’ s delight the sticky drugged sweet agony of habitual anecdotes but these his chairs could bear an old man ’ s tongue sleep when he slept be flattering when he woke and wink to hear the same eternal name from lips new-dipped in rum ‘ then captain cook i heard him told them they could go if so they chose but he would get them back dead or alive he ’ d have them ’ the old man screeched half-thinking to hear ‘ cook cook again cook it ’ s other cooks he ’ ll need cooks who can bake a dinner out of pence that ’ s what he lives on talks on half-a-crown a day and sits there full of cook who ’ d do your cooking now i ’ d like to ask if someone didn ’ t grind her bones away but that ’ s the truth six children and half-a-crown a day and a man gone daft with cook. ’ that was his wife elizabeth a noble wife but brisk who lived in a present full of kitchen-fumes and had no past he had not seen her for seven years being blind and that of course was why he ’ d had to strike a deal with chairs not knowing when those who chafed them had gone to sleep or stolen away darkness and empty chairs this was the port that alexander home had come to with his useless cutlass-wounds and tales of cook and half-a-crown a day— this was the creek he ’ d run his timbers to where grateful countrymen repaid his wounds at half-a-crown a day too good too good this eloquent offering of birdcages to gulls and greenwich hospital to cook britannia ’ s mission to the sea-fowl it was not blindness picked his flesh away nor want of sight made penny-blank the eyes of captain home but that he lived like this in one place and gazed elsewhere his body moved in scotland but his eyes were dazzle-full of skies and water farther round the world— air soaked with blue so thick it dripped like snow on spice-tree boughs and water diamond-green beaches wind-glittering with crumbs of gilt and birds more scarlet than a duchy ’ s seal that had come whistling long ago and far away his body had gone back here it sat drinking rum in berwickshire but not his eyes—they were left floating there half-round the earth blinking at beaches milked by suck-mouth tides foaming with ropes of bubbles and huge half-moons of surf thus it had been when cook was carried on a sailor ’ s back vengeance in a cocked hat to claim his price a prince in barter for a longboat and then the trumpery springs of fate—a stone a musket-shot a round of gunpowder and puzzled animals killing they knew not what or why but killing the surge of goatish flanks armoured in feathers like cruel birds wild childish faces killing a moment seen marines with crimson coats and puffs of smoke toppling face-down and a knife of english iron forged aboard ship that had been changed for pigs given back to cook between the shoulder-blades there he had dropped and the old floundering sea the old fumbling witless lover-enemy had taken his breath last office of salt water cook died the body of alexander home flowed round the world and back again with eyes marooned already and came to english coasts the vague ancestral darknesses of home seeing them faintly through a glass of gold dim fog-shapes ghosted like the ribs of trees against his blazing waters and blue air but soon they faded and there was nothing left only the sugar-cane and the wild granaries of sand and.palm-trees and the flying blood of cardinal-birds and putting out one hand tremulously in the direction of the beach he felt a chair in scotland and sat down

in a side booth at macdonald ’ s before your music class you go up and down in your seat like an arpeggio under the poster of the talking hamburger two white eyes rolling around in the top bun the thin patty of beef imitating the tongue of its animal nature you eat merrily i watch the oakland mommies trying to understand what it means to be “ single. ” across from us females of all ages surround the birthday girl her pale lace and insufficient being can ’ t keep them out of her circle stripes of yellow and brown all over the place the poor in spirit have started to arrive the one with thick midwestern braids twisted like thought on her head usually she brings her mother this week no mother she mouths her words anyway across the table space-mama time-mama mama who should be there families in line imagine all this translated by the cry of time moving through us this place a rubble the gardens new generations will plant in this spot and the food will go on in another order this thought cheers me immensely that we will be there together you still seven bending over the crops pretending to be royalty that the huge woman with one blind eye and dots like eyes all over her dress will also be there eating with pleasure as she eats now right up to the tissue paper peeling it back like bright exotic petals last year on the sun-spilled deck in marin we ate grapes with the russians the kgb man fingered them quickly and dutifully then in a sad tone to us “ we must not eat them so fast we wait in line so long for these ” he said the sight of food going into a woman ’ s mouth made byron sick food is a metaphor for existence when mr. egotistical sublime eating the pasta poked one finger into his mouth he made a sound for some the curve of the bell pepper seems sensual but it can worry you the slightly greasy feel of it the place i went with your father had an apartment to the left and in the window twisted like a huge bowtie an old print bedspread one day when i looked over someone was watching us a young girl the waiter had just brought the first thing an orange with an avocado sliced up cccc in an oil of forceful herbs i couldn ’ t eat it the girl ’ s face stood for something and from it a little mindless daylight was reflected the businessmen at the next table were getting off on each other and the young chardonnay their briefcases leaned against their ankles i watched the young girl ’ s face because for an instant i had seen your face there unterrified unhungry and a little disdainful then the waiter brought the food bands of black seared into it like the memory of a cage you smile over your burger chattering brightly so often at our sunny kitchen table hearing the mantra of the refrigerator i ’ ve thought there was nothing i could do but feed you and i ’ ve always loved the way you eat you eat selfishly humming bending the french fries to your will your brown eyes spotting everything the tall boy who has come in with his mother repressed rage in espadrilles and now carries the tray for her oh this is fun says the mother you stand there with mommy ’ s purse and he stands there smiling after her holding all the patience in the world
talent is what they say you have after the novel is published and favorably reviewed beforehand what you have is a tedious delusion a hobby like knitting work is what you have done after the play is produced and the audience claps before that friends keep asking when you are planning to go out and get a job genius is what they know you had after the third volume of remarkable poems earlier they accuse you of withdrawing ask why you don ’ t have a baby call you a bum the reason people want m.f.a. ’ s take workshops with fancy names when all you can really learn is a few techniques typing instructions and some- body else ’ s mannerisms is that every artist lacks a license to hang on the wall like your optician your vet proving you may be a clumsy sadist whose fillings fall into the stew but you ’ re certified a dentist the real writer is one who really writes talent is an invention like phlogiston after the fact of fire work is its own cure you have to like it better than being loved

at a small monastery—or what had been a monastery—outside obrégon we stopped you were suffering the hollow nausea of your first pregnancy sleeping as best you could through the thousand miles of pines and rocky fields of northern mexico so i went ahead through the saddle-colored rooms past the broken church and the row of empty sheds where indian women according to a sign once baked the flat bread called sapatos de maria to a garden in the back over the parapet of which i could see the river through some willows a rinsed bed of sand dry now in winter i didn ’ t want a child and i was tired of closeness tired of being kind so was glad to be alone a while and lay down under a jacaranda tree and watched through leaves the changing pattern of the sky which i was tired of too the scaly stratospheric winter clouds edged with light like the tiny waves you pointed out reflected on the bottom of a bridge we rowed under in a rented boat the day you told me of the child—i was tired and slept it was nearly evening when i woke two mestizo women hurried talking through the tulip beds the sky was pale they ’ d set small plaques among the plants naming them the ornamentals and the fruit some so the writing said were descendants of the cuttings brought from spain by monks intermingled here—pinot grape with ocotillo damascena rose—they thrived i thought of certain tenderness and forbearance a man might bring to vines and simple vegetables cultivated in memory of his home perhaps in a foreign place and thought how sometimes what passes on from us has little to do with what we hoped but nonetheless carries word of who we were and what we found for a moment then among the arbors and the flower beds i did not feel so distant from this time and place and the edge of my own local fears began to dull i plucked a sprig—a leaf was all— from a holly bush and brought it out to you a little stronger in a portion of myself a little reconciled though i couldn ’ t know then that in a month we would lose the child and in time you would pass like a squandered fortune from my life

into deep space on board the voyager spacecraft esperanto is an artificial language constructed in 1887 by l. l. zamenhof a polish oculist i first came across fundamento esperanto the text which introduced this system to the world as i travelled abroad following a somewhat difficult period in my life it was twilight snowing on the railway platform just outside warsaw where i had missed my connection a man in a crumpled track suit dark glasses pushed a cart piled high with ripped weathered volumes— sex manuals detective stories yellowing musical scores outdated physics textbooks old

’ m afraid i will never be lonely enough there ’ s a man from quebec in my head a friend to the purple martins purple martins are the cadillac of swallows all purple martins are dying or dead brainscans of grown purple martins suggest these creatures feel the same levels of doubt bliss as an eight-year-old girl in captivity while driving home from the brewery one night this man from quebec heard a radio program about purple martins the next day he set out to build them a house in his own back yard i ’ ve never built anything let alone a house not to mention a home for somebody else i ’ ve never unrolled a blueprint onto a workbench sunk a post or sent the neighbor ’ s kid pedalling off to the store for a bag full of nails i ’ ve never waited ten years for a swallow never put in aluminum floors to smooth over the waiting never piped sugar water through colored tubes to each empty nest lined with newspaper shredded with strong tired hands never dismantled the entire affair put it back together again still no swallows i never installed the big light that stays on through the night to keep owls away never installed lesser lights never rested on sunday with a beer on the deck surveying what i had done what yet remained to be done listening to styx while the neighbor kids ran through my sprinklers i have never collapsed in abandon never prayed but enough about purple martins as we speak esperanto is being corrupted by upset languages such as interlingua klingon java various cryptophasic tongues our only hope of reversing this trend is to write the esperanto epic through its grandeur homegrown humility it will spur men to freeze the mutating patios so the children of our children ’ s children may dwell in this song find comfort in its true texture frame it ’ s worth a try as i imagine it it ends in the middle of things every line of the work is a first a last line this is the spring of its action of course there ’ s a journey inside that journey an implicit voyage through the underworld there ’ s a bridge made of boats a carp stuffed with flowers a comic dispute among sweetmeat vendors a digression on shadows men clapping in fields to scare away crows an unending list of warships the unternehmen the impresa the muyarchi viec lam the przedsiebiorstwo the indarka the enterprise l ’ entreprise entrepeno ... one could go on but by now all the characters have turned into swallows bank as one flock in the sky—that is all except one that ’ s how we finally learn who the hero was all along weary old he sits on a rock watches his friends fly by one by one out of the song then turns back to the journey they all began long ago keeping the river to his right

—for j.r. more than a third of a century later meeting for the first time in almost all those years we face each other ’ s still somewhat familiar faces across a table in a california restaurant and wonder why we did it why we suddenly said that night in july in greenwich village “ let ’ s go to connecticut ” and got on a train and ended up at midnight in old greenwich connecticut holding hands on an empty road that wound past serious grown-up sleeping houses ... well i was fifteen you were nearly twenty-one we were experimentally “ in love ” and i guess it must have seemed like “ something to do ” —better than remo anyway or the coffee houses or the eighth street bookstore even in that scratchy heat better than jones beach the long low sober train boring into a wall of black the alien townships spurting past on either side nothing very built up then each with its deserted brilliant platform malting for the next day ’ s passengers the real people who really needed to ride that train how cindery the windows were and spooky with moths outside the glamorous club car where we sat with sodas on itchy plush reclining seats and how the crickets simmered where we got out dizzy on 7up remember the hedges—lilac honeysuckle— along the way as we walked toward we didn ’ t know where we kissed a little under one tasting salt and 7up on each other not sure what next or where then peered at the shadows on lawn after lawn the dim bulk of chimneys shapes of shutters here a trike there a plastic pool and couples snoring mysterious behind those tall white walls until we got embarrassed still not sure what next retraced our steps boarded another train and were hurried back to where we came from feeling like voyeurs like trespassers
“ good morning dear students ” the principal said “ please put down your pencils and go back to bed today we will spend the day playing outside then take the whole school on a carnival ride “ we ’ ll learn to eat candy while watching tv then listen to records and swing from a tree we ’ ll also be learning to draw on the walls to scream in the classrooms and run in the halls “ so bring in your skateboard your scooter your bike it ’ s time to be different and do what you like the teachers are going to give you a rest you don ’ t have to study there won ’ t be a test “ and if you ’ d prefer for a bit of a change feel free to go wild and act really strange go put on a clown suit and dye your hair green and copy your face on the xerox machine “ tomorrow it ’ s back to the regular grind today just go crazy we really don ’ t mind so tear up your homework we ’ ll give you an a. oh wait i ’ m just kidding it ’ s april fools ’ day ”
my father had several times expressed a fear of being buried alive i insisted that the doctor should do whatever was necessary the doctor asked me to leave the room when i came back he was able to assure me that renoir was dead jean renoir it is not 1937 for long a clump of ash trees and a walk down the the boathouse inside linen is tacked up in a long blank mural the children sit on the wings of the dry dock and then over the water in a circle of rowboats the aunts and uncles wait while at their center the projectionist jean renoir on a cedar raft casts silhouettes of rabbits birds and turtles for the sleepy children corks come out of old bottles it is a few minutes past sunset and now a swimmer beside the raft looks into the boathouse to the linens at last it is 1915 a bird screams over the lake two bats flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp interrupting the images the grand illusion cast over water the the acceptance of white tablecloths on the darkening shore of the lake a torch is lit for its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects this film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders not music and algebra but a war and then yet another war but we begin with the captured officers digging a tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall the boches observe the frenchmen working with their hoes as from the trousers of a boy dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure the prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled with snow in the moonlight it is jade-green snow while germans with rifles on a hill are unable to kill them for they have escaped into switzerland with its feather-brushed trees and patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village isn ’ t this the ending of the film no i ’ m sorry but there is a single blossom on the geranium and when it falls captain de boeldieu dies discovering his afterlife along a november road— he does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh beside him nevertheless it is at this moment that the film suffers its true conclusion the two men hiding in the marsh will escape across the border only to be returned to the continuing war this is why there is no importance to your version of the story and there will be another war and more horror for the geranium so to pass the time the imprisoned soldiers receive a steamer trunk filled with women ’ s clothing they will all perform in a revue a chorus of boys and men rouge and talcum black stockings garters the tonneau dresses false breasts and large paper carnations riding up like epaulets on their broad shoulders these poignant inversions are not ridiculous the third boy from the right has delicate milky thighs these women are not ridiculous until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing in this comedy their national anthem the russian prisoners have been given a trunk also from their mysterious czarina the men open it expecting vodka and sausages the box is filled with straw and books on cooking painting and algebra in disgust they burn these books—kiss good-bye the frontier of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe now these officers who are escape artists are moved as an elite corps and north to wintersborn later they are taken to a damp limestone castle from which no one will escape the commandant is the stoic aristocrat rauffenstein his head is in a brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon i mean no disrespect but the balding rauffenstein is an abject picture of suffering his villa has but one flower a tall laden geranium rauffenstein and the other aristocrat boeldieu are friends both would know that to clear a monocle one uses spirits of vinegar they stand confirmed in manner beside a squirrel cage rauffenstein feels superior to the other two principals the rich jew rosenthal and the charming emotional marechal these two hide in the marsh while boeldieu dies of a bullet wound only a king may kill a king and rauffenstein did it with his pistol taking aim but missing the leg he severed in three places boeldieu ’ s intestine the captain is given a room in the turret that holds the flowering geranium now comes the oratio obliqua of the marksman rauffenstein the disfigured commandant is sincerely saddened at having killed the noble captain but before the shooting and escape we sensed the captain ’ s sacrifice was not sacrifice or suicide but the grand escape—a country road into another landscape there are bells tolling down in the village rosenthal and marechal with ropes have dropped past the castle ’ s battlements to the ground they run away across snowy farmland marechal ’ s teeth are stained from chewing licorice-flavored tobacco rosenthal and marechal are extremes who have strong feelings for each other they are befriended by a german widow ulsa and her daughter lotte ulsa sleeps with the tall handsome jew he promises to return for her when the war is over he will lose both his legs at mégéglise this is not known within the story but he ’ ll bleed to death beside a little bridge he lived his illusion in the orient of delacroix his servants were syrians and negroes he loved the little ivory spoons that chinese women in the open markets use to bathe and freshen the exotic tiny fish they sell out of huge clay bowls in the boathouse the children sleep while jean ’ s oldest cousin drunken falls out of a rowboat the lone swimmer has joined renior on the raft the film now reveals the first diversion as all of the prisoners of the fortress begin playing several hundred wooden flutes the noise is like women crying over the fresh mounds at verdun this diversion is not illusion and as the boches collect the flutes the drunken cousin tries to join renior on the raft boeldieu flees to the heights of the castle the second diversion we hear halt halt halt a gunshot and chowder with blood falls from boeldieu ’ s opened stomach all the way down to the courtyard there are small fish bones in the viscera on the cobbled courtyard floor scissors cut the blue blossom from the geranium boeldieu will die dead he awakens on a country road where now a peasant he walks a white horse under the looming bare trees rosenthal and marechal are watching as they hide in the dead marsh flowers of an early november they are alive they do not recognize their friend renoir ’ s cousin asking for more wine climbing onto the raft spills everything and the projector with its crude lamp sinks slowly to the bottom of the lake— its dusky lighted windows like a bathysphere lost off a cable that frayed whoever is alive inside the iron bell is experiencing an eternal falling through water without the promise of a bottom it ’ s 1937 the children asleep in the boathouse are being aroused they wake to a bat caught in the wall of linen they think it ’ s their uncle still casting images of animals for them

greenland ’ s icy mountains are fascinating and grand and wondrously created by the almighty ’ s command and the works of the almighty there ’ s few can understand who knows but it might be a part of fairyland because there are churches of ice and houses glittering like glass and for scenic grandeur there ’ s nothing can it surpass besides there ’ s monuments and spires also ruins which serve for a safe retreat from the wild bruins and there ’ s icy crags and precipices also beautiful waterfalls and as the stranger gazes thereon his heart it appals with a mixture of wonder fear and delight till at last he exclaims oh what a wonderful sight the icy mountains they ’ re higher than a brig ’ s topmast and the stranger in amazement stands aghast as he beholds the water flowing off the melted ice adown the mountain sides that he cries out oh how nice such sights as these are truly magnificent to be seen only that the mountain tops are white instead of green and rents and caverns in them the same as on a rugged mountain side and suitable places in my opinion for mermaids to reside sometimes these icy mountains suddenly topple o ’ er with a wild and rumbling hollow-starting roar and new peaks and cliffs rise up out of the sea while great cataracts of uplifted brine pour down furiously and those that can witness such an awful sight can only gaze thereon in solemn silence and delight and the most godfearless man that hath this region trod would be forced to recognise the power and majesty of god oh how awful and grand it must be on a sunshiny day to see one of these icy mountains in pieces give way while crack after crack it falls with a mighty crash flat upon the sea with a fearful splash and in the breaking up of these mountains they roar like thunder which causes the stranger no doubt to wonder also the esquimaux of greenland betimes will stand and gaze on the wondrous work of the almighty so grand when these icy mountains are falling the report is like big guns and the glittering brilliancy of them causes mock-suns and around them there ’ s connected a beautiful ring of light and as the stranger looks thereon it fills his heart with delight oh think on the danger of seafaring men if any of these mighty mountains where falling on them alas they would be killed ere the hand of man could them save and poor creatures very likely find a watery grave ’ tis most beautiful to see and hear the whales whistling and blowing and the sailors in their small boats quickly after them rowing while the whales keep lashing the water all their might with their mighty tails left and right in winter there ’ s no sunlight there night or day which no doubt will cause the time to pass tediously away and cause the esquimaux to long for the light of day so as they will get basking themselves in the sun ’ s bright array in summer there is perpetual sunlight which fill the esquimaux ’ s hearts with delight and is seen every day and night in the blue sky which makes the scenery appear most beautiful to the eye during summer and winter there the land is covered with snow which sometimes must fill the esquimaux ’ hearts with woe as they traverse fields of ice ten or fifteen feet thick and with cold no doubt their hearts will be touched to the quick and let those that read or hear this feel thankful to god that the icy fields of greenland they have never trod especially while seated around the fireside on a cold winter night let them think of the cold and hardships greenland sailors have to fight

morning reading the bones wetting a fingertip to trace archaic characters i feel a breeze of silence flow up past my wrist icy can i speak here the bones say i must as the first light strikes across the lake magpies scream and the cast bones say the work must come true it ’ s been true all along we are what we do out on our digs dictor and looker all eyes with spade and a jeweler ’ s loupe i sift mud dust for bone for shellcast spy archeologist of freshness i expect sight-made-sound to reveal fear cold at the throat of change and loosen its grip so that mind riding the bloodwarm stream wells up as the speech that bears it and is telling evening magpies scream though the tongues of birds say now and warn forward free of a live past we seek back and forth for change the ghostly sparkling of our watertable under everywhere if i don ’ t speak to tap ease it out i go dry dumb will die wicked on the lake of the poets a stone lamp flickers it casts eight moons dancing casting doubt on the moon that rides above the winter air ice thaws in a poet ’ s throat the springing truth is fresh it wakes taste the taste lasts language floods the mud mind makes a cast of words it precipitates mercurial like t ’ ang discourse riding the tidal constant of its source

the chinaman said don ’ t take the hardware and gave me a steak i couldn ’ t cut except the fat and there was an ant circling the coffee cup i left a dime tip and broke out a stick of cancer and outside i gave an old bum who looked about the way i felt i gave him a quarter and then i went up to see the old man strong as steel girders fit for bombers and blondes up the green rotten steps that housed rats and past the secretaries showing leg and doing nothing and the old man sat there looking at me through two pairs of glasses and a vacation in paris and he said kid i hear you been takin ’ marylou out and i said just to dinner boss and he said just to dinner eh you couldn ’ t hold that broad ’ s pants on with all the rivets on 5th street and please remember you are a shipping clerk i am the boss here and i pay these broads and i pay you yes sir i said and i felt he was going to skip it but he slid my last check across the desk and i took it and walked out past all the lovely legs the skirts pulled up to the ass marylou ’ s ass ann ’ s ass vicki ’ s ass all of them and i went down to the bar and george said whatya gon na do now and i said go to russia or hollywood park and i looked up in time to see marylou come in the long thin nose the delicate face the lips the legs the breasts the music the talk the love the laughing and she said i quit when i found out and the bastard got down on his knees and cried and kissed the hem of my skirt and offered me money and i walked out and he blubbered like a baby george i said another drink and i put a quarter in the juke and the sun came out and i looked outside in time to see the old bum with my quarter and a little more luck that had turned into a happy wine-bottle and a bird even flew by cheep cheep right there on eastside downtown no kidding and the chinaman came in for a quickie claiming somebody had stolen a spoon and a coffee cup and i leaned over and bit marylou on the ear and the whole joint rocked with music and freedom and i decided that russia was too far away and hollywood park just close enough
when i see a couple of kids and guess he ’ s fucking her and she ’ s taking pills or wearing a diaphragm i know this is paradise everyone old has dreamed of all their lives— bonds and gestures pushed to one side like an outdated combine harvester and everyone young going down the long slide to happiness endlessly i wonder if anyone looked at me forty years back and thought that ’ ll be the life no god any more or sweating in the dark about hell and that or having to hide what you think of the priest he and his lot will all go down the long slide like free bloody birds and immediately rather than words comes the thought of high windows the sun-comprehending glass and beyond it the deep blue air that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless
it used to be more private—just the immediate family gathered after mass the baptismal font at the rear of the church tiny as a bird bath the priest would ladle a few teaspoons ’ tepid holy water on the bundled baby ’ s forehead make a crack about the halo being too tight as the new soul wailed we ’ d go home to pancakes and eggs these days it ’ s a big holy-wood production— midmass the giant altar rolls back to reveal a jacuzzi tub surrounded by potted palms the priest hikes up his chasuble steps barefoot out of his black leather loafers and wades in like a newfangled john as organ music swells and the baby-bearing families line up like jumbo jets ready for takeoff but when the godparents handed my niece ’ s newborn naked to their parish priest and he dunked her into the jacuzzi ’ s bath-warm holy water her little one grew so calm and blissful she pooped—not a smelly three-days ’ worth explosive diaper load but enough to notice as the godparents scooped the turds with a handkerchief the savvy priest pretended he hadn ’ t seen swept through the fouled water with his palm before the next baby in line was submerged after mass my niece sat speechless red-faced not knowing what to say— or whether—as church ladies friends and family members presented one by one to the tub where the babies had been baptized as they knelt and bowed and dipped their fingers in and blessed themselves

i the students lost in raucousness caught as by the elder breughel ’ s eye we sit in the college store over sandwiches and coffee wondering she answers eagerly the place was fine sometimes the winds grew very cold the snows so deep and wide she lost sight of people yes she was well satisfied with her work expected— while the quarry ’ s owner was away— to do another year of it ii she is hammering i hear the steady sound inside our dry noisy days sparks fly the mind so taken mighty for a moment becomes quarry and sculptor both something caught like love and war in this golden mesh and daring caught that flings like sparks girls and boys flagrant cities prompt to daring ’ s will love and war its burly seconds iii i see again three kids we passed three kids lounging at the edge of a forsaken quarry like something they had built in its sleepy pool they found the whiteness of their bodies the excitement like parian marble iv such the waters we find ourselves in we sit in the college store absorbed in food and talk eagerness seizes us like love that leaves its best sailors in the mighty waves love the word for hook whose catching and the struggle there is one great musical clash of minds—each wave a passion and a mind— a possessed tumultuous monument that would be free v we strain forward as to some fabulous story incandescence springs from her the hammer of remembrance fresh the young woman bulky graceful body face shining who sculptured all winter alone near the source of her rock digging down into the difficult rock the young woman who lost a day once talked to her cat and when the mirror of her art became too clear when dreaming seemed too big for night alone took long walks back to people back to speech and time the woman who at last— “ i do not use live models ” —sculptured fish— “ i remember long lonely holidays at shores when the spray alone defined green shapes approaching ” —has just seen her eyes still gleam with the gleam of it blink like the making of many a take a great catch vi april we say is the time for fish for reaching in its sea-like waftings one of earth ’ s original conclusions like the leftover gill slits the singing student told us about in this very spot just two days ago we are in the middle of a great catch there collected as from her year-long lonely rock the thrashing clean- scaled clear-lit shad in the net
temples look like discarded alphabets we loved lying in their shadows lazily deciphering and resting and laying bets on what they really were for easily caught by fantasy we no longer cared why they were there just that they were happy to sit down and drink the water we shared having lugged our plastic bottle and hats and camera through the human dung bared right there in the sun—where else could you get relief with no toilets we guzzled it down and splashed it on our arms hands legs and necks a girl in dirty expensive clothes found us with the bottle and asked us for some i said no as she left a gagging smell wound its way out from the bottle ’ s damp lung i ’ ve often been asked to give what i ’ ve saved but under the temple i said no numbed against the girl like one of those bridesmaids who kept her oil in the bible story and was safe for the night i ’ d hated those maids until i became one in my story the shape of the character i ’ d searched for surprising me as the temples did see how golden but pocked they ’ ve become nor are they quite decipherable anymore at least to those who forget what they ’ re for which is worship the greed of prayer “ so that ’ s who you are ” my friend said “ thirsty ” with him i drank not quite the maid in the story but in her shadow like letters at rest in new words on a palimpsest
hot sun cool fire tempered with sweet air black shade fair nurse shadow my white hair shine sun burn fire breathe air and ease me black shade fair nurse shroud me and please me shadow my sweet nurse keep me from burning make not my glad cause cause of mourning let not my beauty ’ s fire inflame unstaid desire nor pierce any bright eye that wandereth lightly
it was like soul-kissing the way the words filled my mouth as mrs. purdy read from her desk all the other kids zoned an hour ahead to 3:15 but mrs. purdy and i wandered lonely as clouds borne by a breeze off mount parnassus she must have seen the darkest eyes in the room brim the next day she gave me a poem she ’ d chosen especially for me to read to the all except for me white class she smiled when she told me to read it smiled harder said oh yes i could she smiled harder and harder until i stood and opened my mouth to banjo playing darkies pickaninnies disses and dats when i finished my classmates stared at the floor we walked silent to the buses awed by the power of words

for ana menendez it only takes one night with the wind on its knees to imagine carl sandburg unfolding a map of chicago puzzled then walking the wrong way the lines on his face are hard to read i alternate between the tv where a plastic surgeon is claiming that every facial expression causes wrinkles and the newspaper i picture the surgeon reading the lines on sandburg ’ s face lines that would ’ ve made more sense if the poet had been say a tree growing in a wind orchard maybe he simply smiled too much i ’ m reading about the all-star game thinking that maybe sandburg saw the white sox of 1919. i love american newspapers the way each section is folded independently and believes it owns the world there ’ s this brief item in the inter- national pages the chinese government has posted signs in tiananmen square forbidding laughter i ’ m sure the plastic surgeon would approve he ’ d say the chinese will look young much longer their faces unnaturally smooth but what i see although no photograph accompanies the story is laughter bursting inside them i go back to the sports section and a closeup of a rookie in mid-swing his face keeping all the wrong emotions in check when i read i bite my lower lip a habit the plastic surgeon would probably call cosmetic heresy because it accelerates the aging process i think of carl sandburg and the white sox i think of wind in tiananmen square how a country deprived of laughter ages invisibly i think of the great walls of north america each of them a grip on some outfield like a rookie ’ s hands around a bat when the wind is against him i bite my lower lip again i want to learn to think in american to believe that a headline is a fact and all stories are suspect
i had just won 115 from the headshakers and was naked upon my bed listening to an opera by one of the italians and had just gotten rid of a very loose lady when there was a knock upon the wood and since the cops had just raided a month or so ago i screamed out rather on edge— who the hell is it what you want man i ’ m your publisher somebody screamed back and i hollered i don ’ t have a publisher try the place next door and he screamed back you ’ re charles bukowski aren ’ t you and i got up and peeked through the iron grill to make sure it wasn ’ t a cop and i placed a robe upon my nakedness kicked a beercan out of the way and bade them enter an editor and a poet only one would drink a beer the editor so i drank two for the poet and one for myself and they sat there sweating and watching me and i sat there trying to explain that i wasn ’ t really a poet in the ordinary sense i told them about the stockyards and the slaughterhouse and the racetracks and the conditions of some of our jails and the editor suddenly pulled five magazines out of a portfolio and tossed them in between the beercans and we talked about flowers of evil rimbaud villon and what some of the modern poets looked like j.b. may and wolf the hedley are very immaculate clean fingernails etc i apologized for the beercans my beard and everything on the floor and pretty soon everybody was yawning and the editor suddenly stood up and i said are you leaving and then the editor and the poet were walking out the door and then i thought well hell they might not have liked what they saw but i ’ m not selling beercans and italian opera and torn stockings under the bed and dirty fingernails i ’ m selling rhyme and life and line and i walked over and cracked a new can of beer and i looked at the five magazines with my name on the cover and wondered what it meant wondered if we are writing poetry or all huddling in one big tent clasping assholes
i hear america singing the varied carols i hear those of mechanics each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong the carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam the mason singing his as he makes ready for work or leaves off work the boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck the shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench the hatter singing as he stands the wood-cutter ’ s song the ploughboy ’ s on his way in the morning or at noon intermission or at sundown the delicious singing of the mother or of the young wife at work or of the girl sewing or washing each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else the day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows robust friendly singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs

30 dogs 20 men on 20 horses and one fox and look here they write you are a dupe for the state the church you are in the ego-dream read your history study the monetary system note that the racial war is 23,000 years old well i remember 20 years ago sitting with an old jewish tailor his nose in the lamplight like a cannon sighted on the enemy and there was an italian pharmacist who lived in an expensive apartment in the best part of town we plotted to overthrow a tottering dynasty the tailor sewing buttons on a vest the italian poking his cigar in my eye lighting me up a tottering dynasty myself always drunk as possible well-read starving depressed but actually a good young piece of ass would have solved all my rancor but i didn ’ t know this i listened to my italian and my jew and i went out down dark alleys smoking borrowed cigarettes and watching the backs of houses come down in flames but somewhere we missed we were not men enough large or small enough or we only wanted to talk or we were bored so the anarchy fell through and the jew died and the italian grew angry because i stayed with his wife when he went down to the pharmacy he did not care to have his personal government overthrown and she overthrew easy and i had some guilt the children were asleep in the other bedroom but later i won 200 in a crap game and took a bus to new orleans and i stood on the corner listening to the music coming from bars and then i went inside to the bars and i sat there thinking about the dead jew how all he did was sew on buttons and talk and how he gave way although he was stronger than any of us he gave way because his bladder would not go on and maybe that saved wall street and manhattan and the church and central park west and rome and the left bank but the pharmacist ’ s wife she was nice she was tired of bombs under the pillow and hissing the pope and she had a very nice figure very good legs but i guess she felt as i that the weakness was not government but man one at a time that men were never as strong as their ideas and that ideas were governments turned into men and so it began on a couch with a spilled martini and it ended in the bedroom desire revolution nonsense ended and the shades rattled in the wind rattled like sabers cracked like cannon and 30 dogs 20 men on 20 horses chased one fox across the fields under the sun and i got out of bed and yawned and scratched my belly and knew that soon very soon i would have to get very drunk again
we are born with dreams in our hearts looking for better days ahead at the gates we are given new papers our old clothes are taken and we are given overalls like mechanics wear we are given shots and doctors ask questions then we gather in another room where counselors orient us to the new land we will now live in we take tests some of us were craftsmen in the old world good with our hands and proud of our work others were good with their heads they used common sense like scholars use glasses and books to reach the world but most of us didn ’ t finish high school the old men who have lived here stare at us from deep disturbed eyes sulking retreated we pass them as they stand around idle leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls our expectations are high in the old world they talked about rehabilitation about being able to finish school and learning an extra good trade but right away we are sent to work as dishwashers to work in fields for three cents an hour the administration says this is temporary so we go about our business blacks with blacks poor whites with poor whites chicanos and indians by themselves the administration says this is right no mixing of cultures let them stay apart like in the old neighborhoods we came from we came here to get away from false promises from dictators in our neighborhoods who wore blue suits and broke our doors down when they wanted arrested us when they felt like swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased but it ’ s no different here it ’ s all concentrated the doctors don ’ t care our bodies decay our minds deteriorate we learn nothing of value our lives don ’ t get better we go down quick my cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines my t-shirts boxer shorts socks and pants are drying just like it used to be in my neighborhood from all the tenements laundry hung window to window across the way joey is sticking his hands through the bars to hand felipé a cigarette men are hollering back and forth cell to cell saying their sinks don ’ t work or somebody downstairs hollers angrily about a toilet overflowing or that the heaters don ’ t work i ask coyote next door to shoot me over a little more soap to finish my laundry i look down and see new immigrants coming in mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders new haircuts and brogan boots looking around each with a dream in their heart thinking they ’ ll get a chance to change their lives but in the end some will just sit around talking about how good the old world was some of the younger ones will become gangsters some will die and others will go on living without a soul a future or a reason to live some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes but so very few make it out of here as human as they came in they leave wondering what good they are now as they look at their hands so long away from their tools as they look at themselves so long gone from their families so long gone from life itself so many things have changed

you may hear that your heartbeat is uneven and let new tension climb around your shoulders thinking you 've found the trick for going mad but try to keep a grip on where you are remember all around you is pure city try to stay alert on the wide streets so empty late at night streaking in glass the color of an alley or the fall of a sideways flicker from a neon sign may utterly and briefly disconcert you— but as you go you 'll find that noise is worse prepare for noise but never scream even tensing ears too far in advance can sharpen sirens and as for horns ... when you 're back to your normal rhythm after such encounters just try to stay alert you 'll never know exactly who is coming up behind you but the sudden movement of pedestrians will finally of course be what disarms you
still sits the school-house by the road a ragged beggar sleeping around it still the sumachs grow and blackberry-vines are creeping within the master ’ s desk is seen deep scarred by raps official the warping floor the battered seats the jack-knife ’ s carved initial the charcoal frescos on its wall its door ’ s worn sill betraying the feet that creeping slow to school went storming out to playing long years ago a winter sun shone over it at setting lit up its western window-panes and low eaves ’ icy fretting it touched the tangled golden curls and brown eyes full of grieving of one who still her steps delayed when all the school were leaving for near her stood the little boy her childish favor singled his cap pulled low upon a face where pride and shame were mingled pushing with restless feet the snow to right and left he lingered — as restlessly her tiny hands the blue-checked apron fingered he saw her lift her eyes he felt the soft hand ’ s light caressing and heard the tremble of her voice as if a fault confessing “ i ’ m sorry that i spelt the word i hate to go above you because ” —the brown eyes lower fell — “ because you see i love you ” still memory to a gray-haired man that sweet child-face is showing dear girl the grasses on her grave have forty years been growing he lives to learn in life ’ s hard school how few who pass above him lament their triumph and his loss like her —because they love him
i had never seen a cornfield in my life i had never been to oklahoma but i was singing as loud as anyone “ oh what a beautiful morning the corn is as high as an elephant ’ s eye ” though i knew something about elephants i thought coming from the same continent as they did and they being more like camels than anything else and when we sang from meet me in st. louis “ clang clang clang went the trolley ” i remembered the ride from ramleh station in the heart of alexandria all the way to roushdy where my grandmother lived the autos on the roadways vying with mule carts and bicycles the mediterranean half a mile off on the left the air smelling sharply of diesel and salt it was a problem which had dogged me for a few years this confusion of places and when in 5th grade geography i had pronounced “ des moines ” as though it were a village in france mr. kephart led me to the map on the front wall and so i ’ d know where i was pressed my forehead squarely against iowa des moines he ’ d said rhymes with coins now we were singing “ zippidy-doo-dah zippidy-ay ” and every song we ’ d sung had in it either sun or bluebirds fair weather or fancy fringe o beautiful america and one tier below me there was linda deemer with her amber waves and lovely fruited plains and she was part of america too along with sun and spacious sky though untouchable and as distant as purple mountains of majesty “ this is my country ” we sang and a few years ago there would have been a scent of figs in the air mangoes and someone playing the oud along a clear stream but now it was “ my country 't is of thee ” and i sang it out with all my heart and now with linda deemer in mind “ land where my fathers died ” i bellowed and it was not too hard to imagine a host of my great-uncles and -grandfathers stunned from their graves in the turkish interior and finding themselves suddenly on a rock among maize and poultry and squanto shaking their hands how could anyone not think america was exotic when it had massachusetts and the long tables of thanksgiving and how could it not be home if it were the place where love first struck we had finished singing the sun was shining through large windows on the beatified faces of all who had sung well and with feeling we were ready to file out and march back to our room where mr. kephart was waiting already linda deemer had disappeared into the high society of the hallway one day i was going to tell her something des moines i was saying to myself baton rouge terre haute boise
house of five fires you never raised me those nights when the throat of the furnace wheezed and rattled its regular death i wanted your wide door your mottled air of bark and working sunlight wanted your smokehole with its stars and your roof curving its singing mouth above me here are the tiers once filled with sleepers and their low laughter measured harmony or strife here i could wake amazed at winter my breath in the draft a chain of violets the house i left as a child now seems a shell of sobs each year i dream it sinister and dig in my heels to keep out the intruder banging at the back door my eyes burn from cat urine under the basement stairs and the hall reveals a nameless hunger as if without a history i should always walk the cluttered streets of this hapless continent thinking it best i be wanderer i rode whatever river ignoring every zigzag every spin i ’ ve been a fragment less than my name shaking in a solitary landscape like the last burnt leaf on an oak what autumn wind told me you ’ d be waiting house of five fires they take you for a tomb but i know better when desolation comes i ’ ll hide your ridgepole in my spine and melt into crow call reminding my children that spiders near your door joined all the reddening blades of grass without oil hasp or uranium
for louis asekoff mid-october massachusetts we drive through the livid innards of a beast—dragon or salamander—whose home is fire the hills a witch ’ s quilt of goldrust flushed cinnamon wine fever hectic lemon after dark while water ruffles salted in a big pot we four gather towards the woodfire exchanging lazy sentences waiting dinner sunk in the supermarket cardboard box the four lobsters tip and coolly stroke each other with rockblue baton legs and tentative antennae their breath a wet clicking the undulant slow shift of their plated bodies like the doped drift of patients in the padded ward eyes like squished berries out on stalks it ’ s the end of the line for them yet faintly in that close-companioned air they smell the sea a shadow-haunted hole to hide in till all this blows over when it ’ s time we turn the music up to nerve us to it then take them one by one and drop in the salty roil and scald then clamp the big lid back grasping the shapely fantail i plunge mine in headfirst and feel before i can detach myself the flat slap of a jackknifed back glimpse for an instant before i put the lid on it the rigid backward bow-bend of the whole body as the brain explodes and lidless eyes sear white we two are bound in silence till the pot-lid planks back and music floods again like a tide minutes later the four of us bend to brittle pink intricate shells drawing white sweet flesh with our fingers sewing our shroud-talk tight about us later near moonless midnight when i scrape the leafbright broken remains into the garbage can outside that last knowing spasm eels up my arm again and off like a flash across the rueful stars
forty degrees the threat of rain that time of fall when we are most inclined to end it all denim-jacketed with a faded sweatshirt hood he draws his plane along a length of wood then takes a chisel to a cornice piece with two light taps his movements never cease his cracked and callused hands in gloves with fingers cut rub up for warmth then start like hares hawked by his thought he knows no other work wants none he learned this from his father—brace and auger bob and plumb— the same way he learned how to hunt or take a beating not by words but by a look and by repeating mutely each grimace wince set of the jaw his job is more than workmanlike no flaw or gap offends the eye each post and bull-nose stair seems proof of love—if love is proved by excess care
home ’ s the place we head for in our sleep boxcars stumbling north in dreams don ’ t wait for us we catch them on the run the rails old lacerations that we love shoot parallel across the face and break just under turtle mountains riding scars you can ’ t get lost home is the place they cross the lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark less tolerant we watch through cracks in boards as the land starts rolling rolling till it hurts to be here cold in regulation clothes we know the sheriff ’ s waiting at midrun to take us back his car is dumb and warm the highway doesn ’ t rock it only hums like a wing of long insults the worn-down welts of ancient punishments lead back and forth all runaways wear dresses long green ones the color you would think shame was we scrub the sidewalks down because it 's shameful work our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear a moment things us kids pressed on the dark face before it hardened pale remembering delicate old injuries the spines of names and leaves
poem for sriram shamasunder and all of poetry for the people it ’ s a sunlit morning with jasmine blooming easily and a drove of robin redbreasts diving into the ivy covering what used to be a backyard fence or doves shoving aside the birch tree leaves when a young man walks among the flowers to my doorway where he knocks then stands still brilliant in a clean white shirt he lifts a soft fist to that door and knocks again he ’ s come to say this was or that was not and what ’ s anyone of us to do about what ’ s done what ’ s past but prickling salt to sting our eyes what ’ s anyone of us to do about what ’ s done and 7-month-old bingo puppy leaps and hits that clean white shirt with muddy paw prints here and here and there and what ’ s anyone of us to do about what ’ s done i say i ’ ll wash the shirt no problem two times through the delicate blue cycle of an old machine the shirt spins in the soapy suds and spins in rinse and spins and spins out dry not clean still marked by accidents by energy of whatever serious or trifling cause the shirt stays dirty from that puppy ’ s paws i take that fine white shirt from india the threads as soft as baby fingers weaving them together and i wash that shirt between between the knuckles of my own two hands i scrub and rub that shirt to take the dirty markings out at the pocket and around the shoulder seam and on both sleeves the dirt the paw prints tantalize my soap my water my sweat equity invested in the restoration of a clean white shirt and on the eleventh try i see no more no anything unfortunate no dirt i hold the limp fine cloth between the faucet stream of water as transparent as a wish the moon stayed out all day how small it has become that clean white shirt how delicate how slight how like a soft fist knocking on my door and now i hang the shirt to dry as slowly as it needs the air to work its way with everything it ’ s clean a clean white shirt nobody wanted to spoil or soil that shirt much cleaner now but also not the same as the first before that shirt got hit got hurt not perfect anymore just beautiful a clean white shirt it ’ s hard to keep a clean shirt clean
for peter parrish each morning the man rises from bed because the invisible cord leading from his neck to someplace in the dark the cord that makes him always dissatisfied has been wound tighter and tighter until he wakes he greets his family looking for himself in their eyes but instead he sees shorter or taller men men with different degrees of anger or love the kind of men that people who hardly know him often mistake for him leaving a movie or running to catch a bus he has a job that he goes to it could be at a bank or a library or turning a piece of flat land into a ditch all day something that refuses to show itself hovers at the corner of his eye like a name he is trying to remember like expecting a touch on the shoulder as if someone were about to embrace him a woman in a blue dress whom he has never met would never meet again and it seems the purpose of each day ’ s labor is simply to bring this mystery to focus he can almost describe it as if it were a figure at the edge of a burning field with smoke swirling around it like white curtains shot full of wind and light when he returns home he studies the eyes of his family to see what person he should be that evening he wants to say all day i have been listening all day i have felt i stood on the brink of something amazing but he says nothing and his family walks around him as if he were a stick leaning against a wall late in the evening the cord around his neck draws him to bed he is consoled by the coolness of sheets pressure of blankets he turns to the wall and as water drains from a sink so his daily mind slips from him then sleep rises before him like a woman in a blue dress and darkness puts its arms around him embracing him be true to me it says each night you belong to me more until at last i lift you up and wrap you within me
it 's such a shock i almost screech when i find a worm inside my peach but then what really makes me blue is to find a worm who 's bit in two

oh mighty city of new york you are wonderful to behold your buildings are magnificent the truth be it told they were the only thing that seemed to arrest my eye because many of them are thirteen storeys high and as for central park it is lovely to be seen especially in the summer season when its shrubberies and trees are green and the burns ’ statue is there to be seen surrounded by trees on the beautiful sward so green also shakespeare and sir walter scott which by englishmen and scotchmen will ne ’ er be forgot there the people on the sabbath-day in thousands resort all loud in conversation and searching for sport some of them viewing the menagerie of wild beasts there and also beautiful black swans i do declare and there ’ s beautiful boats to be seen there and the joyous shouts of the children do rend the air while the boats sail along with them o ’ er lohengrin lake and the fare is five cents for children and adults ten is all they take and there ’ s also summer-house shades and merry-go-rounds and with the merry laughter of the children the park resounds during the livelong sabbath day enjoying the merry-go-round play then there ’ s the elevated railroads about five storeys high which the inhabitants can see and hear night and day passing by oh such a mass of people daily do throng no less than five hundred thousand daily pass along and all along the city you can get for five cents and believe me among the passengers there are few discontent and the top of the houses are all flat and in the warm weather the people gather to chat besides on the house-tops they dry their clothes and also many people all night on the house-tops repose and numerous ships and steamboats are there to be seen sailing along the east river water so green ’ tis certainly a most beautiful sight to see them sailing o ’ er the smooth water day and night and brooklyn bridge is a very great height and fills the stranger ’ s heart with wonder at first sight but with all its loftiness i venture to say for beauty it can not surpass the new railway bridge of the silvery tay and there ’ s also ten thousand rumsellers there oh wonderful to think i do declare to accommodate the people of that city therein and to encourage them to commit all sorts of sin and on the sabbath-day ye will see many a man going for beer with a tin can and seems proud to be seen carrying home the beer to treat his neighbours and family dear then at night numbers of the people dance and sing making the walls of their houses to ring with their songs and dancing on sabbath night which i witnessed with disgust and fled from the sight and with regard to new york and the sights i did see one street in dundee is more worth to me and believe me the morning i sailed from new york for bonnie dundee my heart it felt as light as a cork
for elizabeth ryle immediately cries were heard these were the loud wailing of infant souls weeping at the very entrance-way never had they had their share of life ’ s sweetness for the dark day had stolen them from their mothers ’ breasts and plunged them to a death before their time —virgil the aeneid book vi and then the dark fell and ‘ there has never ’ i said ‘ been a poem to an antibiotic never a word to compare with the odes on the flower of the raw sloe for fever ‘ or the devious africa-seeking tern or the protein treasures of the sea-bed depend on it somewhere a poet is wasting his sweet uncluttered metres on the obvious ‘ emblem instead of the real thing instead of sulpha we shall have hyssop dipped in the wild blood of the unblemished lamb so every day the language gets less ‘ for the task and we are less with the language. ’ i finished speaking and the anger faded and dark fell and the book beside me lay open at the page aphrodite comforts sappho in her love ’ s duress the poplars shifted their music in the garden a child startled in a dream my room was a mess— the usual hardcovers half-finished cups clothes piled up on an old chair— and i was listening out but in my head was a loosening and sweetening heaviness not sleep but nearly sleep not dreaming really but as ready to believe and still unfevered calm and unsurprised when she came and stood beside me and i would have known her anywhere and i would have gone with her anywhere and she came wordlessly and without a word i went with her down down down without so much as ever touching down but always always with a sense of mulch beneath us the way of stairs winding down to a river and as we went on the light went on failing and i looked sideways to be certain it was she misshapen musical— sappho—the scholiast ’ s nightingale and down we went again down until we came to a sudden rest beside a river in what seemed to be an oppressive suburb of the dawn my eyes got slowly used to the bad light at first i saw shadows only shadows then i could make out women and children and in the way they were the grace of love ‘ cholera typhus croup diptheria ’ she said ‘ in those days they racketed in every backstreet and alley of old europe behold the children of the plague. ’ then to my horror i could see to each nipple some had clipped a limpet shape— suckling darknesses—while others had their arms weighed down making terrible pietàs she took my sleeve and said to me ‘ be careful do not define these women by their work not as washerwomen trussed in dust and sweating muscling water into linen by the river ’ s edge ‘ nor as court ladies brailled in silk on wool and woven with an ivory unicorn and hung nor as laundresses tossing cotton brisking daylight with lavender and gossip ‘ but these are women who went out like you when dusk became a dark sweet with leaves recovering the day stooping picking up teddy bears and rag dolls and tricycles and buckets— ‘ love ’ s archaeology—and they too like you stood boot deep in flowers once in summer or saw winter come in with a single magpie in a caul of haws a solo harlequin. ’ i stood fixed i could not reach or speak to them between us was the melancholy river the dream water the narcotic crossing and they had passed over it its cold persuasions i whispered ‘ let me be let me at least be their witness ’ but she said ‘ what you have seen is beyond speech beyond song only not beyond love ‘ remember it you will remember it ’ and i heard her say but she was fading fast as we emerged under the stars of heaven ‘ there are not many of us you are dear ‘ and stand beside me as my own daughter i have brought you here so you will know forever the silences in which are our beginnings in which we have an origin like water ’ and the wind shifted and the window clasp opened banged and i woke up to find the poetry books stacked higgledy piggledy my skirt spread out where i had laid it— nothing was changed nothing was more clear but it was wet and the year was late the rain was grief in arrears my children slept the last dark out safely and i wept
anghiari is medieval a sleeve sloping down a steep hill suddenly sweeping out to the edge of a cliff and dwindling but far up the mountain behind the town we too were swept out out by the wind alone with the tuscan grass wind had been blowing across the hills for days and everything now was graying gold with dust everything we saw even some small children scampering along a road twittering italian to a small caged bird we sat beside them to rest in some brushwood and i leaned down to rinse the dust from my face i found the spider web there whose hinges reeled heavily and crazily with the dust whole mounds and cemeteries of it sagging and scattering shadows among shells and wings and then she stepped into the center of air slender and fastidious the golden hair of daylight along her shoulders she poised there while ruins crumbled on every side of her free of the dust as though a moment before she had stepped inside the earth to bathe herself i gazed close to her till at last she stepped away in her own good time many men have searched all over tuscany and never found what i found there the heart of the light itself shelled and leaved balancing on filaments themselves falling the secret of this journey is to let the wind blow its dust all over your body to let it go on blowing to step lightly lightly all the way through your ruins and not to lose any sleep over the dead who surely will bury their own don ’ t worry

i drove through the narrow gods— privet and cholesterol or irish creamery butter as the waiter called it as it shaved another day off my life there was no salt and antimony just lumpy roads through meath and leitrim the sky was a show of flashing mirrors as day broke on rosses tide out and weed like cow pies on the shore the punt down and the eec on the horizon as i read in the guidebook about pilgrims climbing st. patrick ’ s barefoot every summer out of the fog a man in wranglers and spurred boots clean-shaven a cigarette in hand waved me down “ scrum faced house at the end of the bay. ” “ hop in ” i said “ you lookin ’ for where john wayne made the quiet man ” “ no. ” “ american ” “ yep. ” “ don ’ t look it you jewish too ” “ no. ” “ i-talian ” “ no. ” the fog was lifting off the fern-scalded mountains across the bay and the sheep marked red and blue looked like sweaters “ grace o ’ malley hijacked british ships up here and the choctaws sent 500 during the famine not a fuckin ’ penny from the u.s. ” we passed the rusted hulls of fishing boats and the scaffolding of floating mussel beds “ the downing street accord is lots of shit adams ’ a frog on an oil slick when lord haw haw broadcast for the nazis from right here do ya think he was a traitor or a patriot … to us i mean ” i couldn ’ t bring myself to tell him i was on sabbatical and looking for a place to write “ they ’ ll turn the bog to marks spencer anyway. ” “ i ’ m looking for knock-na-rae. ” “ maeve ’ s mountain two hours from here in the other direction. ” i dropped him at the scrum house half roofless and cracked where the sky seemed lower than the rocks and the hills the color of red sheep
the kindergarten concert was an interesting show peter walked onto the stage and yelled “ i have to go ” katie was embarrassed but she had nowhere to hide she raised her dress to hide her face her mother almost died keith removed his tie and said “ it ’ s ugly dad i hate it ” david picked his nose on stage what ’ s worse is that he ate it they sang their song and wyatt burped then he did a dance michael fell while spinning ’ round peter wet his pants the music teacher at the end said “ there i ’ m glad that ’ s done. ” the kindergarten bowed and said “ let ’ s sing another one ”
when you move away you see how much depends on the pace of the days—how much depended on the haze we waded through each summer visible heat wavy and discursive as the lazy track of the snake in the dusty road and on the habit in town of porches thatched in vines and in the country long dense promenades the way we sacrificed the yards to shade it was partly the heat that made my father plant so many trees—two maples marking the site for the house two elms on either side when it was done mimosa by the fence and as it failed fast-growing chestnuts loblolly pines and dogwood redbud ornamental crab on the farm everything else he grew something could eat but this would be a permanent mark of his industry a glade established in the open field or so it seemed looking back at the empty house from across the hill i see how well the house is camouflaged see how that porous fence of saplings their later scrim of foliage thickened around it and still he chinked and mortared planting more last summer although he ’ d lost all tolerance for heat he backed the truck in at the family grave and stood in the truckbed all afternoon pruning the landmark oak repairing recent damage by a wind then he came home and hung a swing in one of the horse-chestnuts for my visit the heat was a hand at his throat a fist to his weak heart but it made a triumph of the cooler air inside in the bedroom in the maple bedstead where he slept in the brick house nearly swamped by leaves

his eye was wild and his face was taut with anger and hate and rage and the things he muttered were much too strong for the ink of the printed page i found him there when the dusk came down in his golf clothes still was he and his clubs were strewn around his feet as he told his grief to me “ i ’ d an easy five for a seventy-nine—in sight of the golden goal— an easy five and i took an eight—an eight on the eighteenth hole “ i ’ ve dreamed my dreams of the ‘ seventy men ’ and i ’ ve worked year after year i have vowed i would stand with the chosen few ere the end of my golf career i ’ ve cherished the thought of a seventy score and the days have come and gone and i ’ ve never been close to the golden goal my heart was set upon but today i stood on the eighteenth tee and counted that score of mine and my pulses raced with the thrill of joy—i ’ d a five for seventy-nine “ i can kick the ball from the eighteenth tee and get this hole in five bit i took the wood and i tried to cross that ditch with a mighty drive— ” let us end the quotes it is best for all to imagine his language rich but he topped that ball as we often do and the pill stopped in the ditch his third was short and his fourth was bad and his fifth was off the line and he took an eight on the eighteenth hole with a five for a seventy-nine i gathered his clubs and i took his arm and alone in the locker room i left him sitting upon the bench a picture of grief and gloom and the last man came and took his shower and hurried upon his way but still he sat with his head bowed down like one with a mind astray and he counted his score card o ’ er and o ’ er and muttered this doleful whine “ i took an eight on the eighteenth hole with a five for a seventy-nine ”

in the sad november time when the leaf has left the lime and the cam with sludge and slime plasters his ugly channel while with sober step and slow round about the marshes low stiffening students stumping go shivering through their flannel then to me in doleful mood rises up a question rude asking what sufficient good comes of this mode of living moping on from day to day grinding up what will not “ pay ” till the jaded brain gives way under its own misgiving why should wretched man employ years which nature meant for joy striving vainly to destroy freedom of thought and feeling still the injured powers remain endless stores of hopeless pain when at last the vanquished brain languishes past all healing where is then his wealth of mind— all the schemes that hope designed gone like spring to leave behind indolent melancholy thus he ends his helpless days vex ’ t with thoughts of former praise— tell me how are wisdom ’ s ways better than senseless folly happier those whom trifles please dreaming out a life of ease sinking by unfelt degrees into annihilation or the slave to labour born heedless of the freeman ’ s scorn destined to be slowly worn down to the brute creation thus a tempting spirit spoke as from troubled sleep i woke to a morning thick with smoke sunless and damp and chilly then to sleep i turned once more eyes inflamed and windpipe sore dreaming dreams i dreamt before only not quite so silly in my dream methought i strayed where a learned-looking maid stores of flimsy goods displayed articles not worth wearing “ these ” she said with solemn air “ are the robes that sages wear warranted when kept with care never to need repairing. ” then unnumbered witlings caught by her wiles the trappings bought and by labour not by thought honour and fame were earning while the men of wiser mind passed for blind among the blind pedants left them far behind in the career of learning “ those that fix their eager eyes ever on the nearest prize well may venture to despise loftier aspirations pedantry is in demand buy it up at second-hand seek no more to understand profitless speculations. ” thus the gaudy gowns were sold cast off sloughs of pedants old proudly marched the students bold through the domain of error till their trappings false though fair mouldered off and left them bare clustering close in blank despair nakedness cold and terror then i said “ these haughty schools boast that by their formal rules they produce more learned fools than could be well expected learned fools they are indeed learned in the books they read fools whene ’ er they come to need wisdom too long neglected “ oh that men indeed were wise and would raise their purblind eyes to the opening mysteries scattered around them ever truth should spring from sterile ground beauty beam from all around right should then at last be found joining what none may sever ”
‘ is there anybody there ’ said the traveller knocking on the moonlit door and his horse in the silence champed the grasses of the forest ’ s ferny floor and a bird flew up out of the turret above the traveller ’ s head and he smote upon the door again a second time ‘ is there anybody there ’ he said but no one descended to the traveller no head from the leaf-fringed sill leaned over and looked into his grey eyes where he stood perplexed and still but only a host of phantom listeners that dwelt in the lone house then stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight to that voice from the world of men stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair that goes down to the empty hall hearkening in an air stirred and shaken by the lonely traveller ’ s call and he felt in his heart their strangeness their stillness answering his cry while his horse moved cropping the dark turf ’ neath the starred and leafy sky for he suddenly smote on the door even louder and lifted his head — ‘ tell them i came and no one answered that i kept my word ’ he said never the least stir made the listeners though every word he spake fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house from the one man left awake ay they heard his foot upon the stirrup and the sound of iron on stone and how the silence surged softly backward when the plunging hoofs were gone

the pearls mere reminders the ocean ’ s rapid recoil a signal the gulls appeared enormous in that way only things from above can— such is presentation of the sudden if only this were worthy of a frame the wooden gesture announcing a moment past were cherished but it was too late for that too late to answer the surf ’ s anxious why too late to decline the continuous life he had resigned himself turning away from the grave that plot being too familiar to so many of course immortality had its price first his staff he had taped back together then the sleeves of his robe he had reclaimed from the depths then the magic leached nightly from his fingertips so that now his incantation for a storm brought only a slight breeze a quick sun shower that frightened only the flowers struggling in the salt air now showing his centuries he insists this is the wind out of which i bring clouds these are my hands that gnarled though they be when lifted to the sky bring rain

the man moves earth to dispel grief he digs holes the size of cars in proportion to what is taken what is given multiplies— rain-swollen ponds and dirt mounds rooted with flame-tipped flowers he carries trees like children struggling to be set down trees that have lived out their lives he cuts and stacks like loaves of bread which he will feed the fire the green smoke sweetens his house the woman sweeps air to banish sadness she dusts floors polishes objects made of clay and wood in proportion to what is taken what is given multiplies— the task of something else to clean gleaming appliances beg to be smudged breathed upon by small children and large animals flicking out hope as she whirls by flap of tongue scratch of paw sweetly reminding her the man moves earth the woman sweeps air together they pull water out of the other pull with the muscular ache of the living hauling from the deep well of the body the rain-swollen the flame-tipped the milk-fed— all that cycles through lives moving lives sweeping water circulating between them like breath drawn out of leaves by light

i really do wish i did because if i loved lawnmowers i could go to the lawnmower museum i just heard about on the radio in a piece about small museums it ’ s in southport apparently — a seaside town “ fringed to the north by the ribble estuary ” according to wikipedia it would be quite a trip to go up there and i ’ d almost certainly have to stay the night i think i might stay in the prince of wales hotel which looks conveniently situated for the station and the museum too i can hardly bear to think how much i ’ d be looking forward to making that trip if i loved lawnmowers on the radio they said they have all sorts of models from victorian ones all the way through to a state-of-the-art robot one that ’ s powered by solar energy if i was planning the visit i ’ d probably have a bit of a virtual walk-round on street view and in fact i ’ ve just done exactly that in an effort to capture the feeling i ’ d have if i was actually anticipating a trip to the lawnmower museum exploring the area i discovered that southport looks very much like weston-super-mare where as it happens i stayed in a halfway house many years ago after doing a stint in rehab now crack cocaine — that i loved

we spend our morning in the flower stalls counting the dark tongues of bells that hang from ropes waiting for the silence of an hour we find a table ask for paella cold soup and wine where a calm light trembles years behind us in buenos aires only three years ago it was the last time his hand slipped into her dress with pearls cooling her throat and bells like these chipping at the night— as she talks the hollow clopping of a horse the sound of bones touched together the paella comes a bed of rice and camarones fingers and shells the lips of those whose lips have been removed mussels the soft blue of a leg socket this is not paella this is what has become of those who remained in buenos aires this is the ring of a rifle report on the stones her hand over her mouth her husband falling against her these are the flowers we bought this morning the dahlias tossed on his grave and bells waiting with their tongues cut out for this particular silence
the messenger runs not carrying the news of victory or defeat the messenger unresting has always been running the wind before and behind him across the turning back of earth leaving his tracks across the plains his ropes hanging from the ledges of mountains for centuries millennia he has been running carrying whatever it is that can not be put down it is rolled in a tube made of hide carefully to keep it dry as he runs through storms and monsoons sometimes on foot sometimes poling a boat through a flooded mangrove swamp or setting stiff sails to cross from island to island running before the wind in some ages peasants have helped him—bringing him small cakes of rice wrapped in the weeds of the sea and new sandals woven of hemp for his torn bleeding feet sometimes in the heat of noon they would offer a drink of rosewater sometimes a coat of fur against the winter snows and sometimes at night he would rest by a fire where voices wove with the music of gut-strings or with mountain pipes whose sound was like wind through the bones of creation—and he would be cheered by the company of others the firelit glow of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark at times rumors spread of his death scholars analyzed his obsession dated his bones his prayer bundle but at dawn he always arose in the mists in the blur of so many mornings so many shoes worn into scraps and discarded so many the cities that burned as he passed them so many the skulls abandoned by armies so many whose blood stained the threads of their prayer rugs so many so many so many— oh and that green sunlit hill that kept rising from the dark waters of flood outlined bright against the sky the odds the evidence— and he the messenger running through history carries this small tube its durable hide—carries it not like a torch no nothing so blazing not like the brass lamp that summons a genie no magic wishes not like the candles that hope sets aflame and a breath can extinguish ... no he carried it like what has no likeness what is curled up inside and he swore he could feel it though perhaps he had dreamed it still at times stopping under some tree or other when the night was warm so close the stars seemed to breathe in the branches he would lie quiet then it would seem that whatever it was in there would pulse softly with light a code only the heart could break but of course he couldn ’ t say for he was only the messenger — and at sunrise wearily he would rise to his feet and trudge on sometimes running sometimes stumbling carrying whatever it was that could not be put down would not be cast aside— and besides he would chide himself weren ’ t they all as tired as he and hadn ’ t they helped him time and again on his way

luxurious man to bring his vice in use did after him the world seduce and from the fields the flowers and plants allure where nature was most plain and pure he first enclosed within the gardens square a dead and standing pool of air and a more luscious earth for them did knead which stupified them while it fed the pink grew then as double as his mind the nutriment did change the kind with strange perfumes he did the roses taint and flowers themselves were taught to paint the tulip white did for complexion seek and learned to interline its cheek its onion root they then so high did hold that one was for a meadow sold another world was searched through oceans new to find the marvel of peru and yet these rarities might be allowed to man that sovereign thing and proud had he not dealt between the bark and tree forbidden mixtures there to see no plant now knew the stock from which it came he grafts upon the wild the tame that th ’ uncertain and adulterate fruit might put the palate in dispute his green seraglio has its eunuchs too lest any tyrant him outdo and in the cherry he does nature vex to procreate without a sex ’ tis all enforced the fountain and the grot while the sweet fields do lie forgot where willing nature does to all dispense a wild and fragrant innocence and fauns and fairies do the meadows till more by their presence than their skill their statues polished by some ancient hand may to adorn the gardens stand but howsoe ’ er the figures do excel the gods themselves with us do dwell

book six chapter xliv i in hill-towns from san fernando to mayagüez the same sunrise stirred the feathered lances of cane down the archipelago ’ s highways the first breeze rattled the spears and their noise was like distant rain marching down from the hills like a shell at your ears in the cool asphalt sundays of the antilles the light brought the bitter history of sugar across the squared fields heightening towards harvest to the bleached flags of the indian diaspora the drizzling light blew across the savannah darkening the racehorses ’ hides mist slowly erased the royal palms on the crests of the hills and the hills themselves the brown patches the horses had grazed shone as wet as their hides a skittish stallion jerked at his bridle marble-eyed at the thunder muffling the hills but the groom was drawing him in like a fisherman wrapping the slack line under one fist then with the other tightening the rein and narrowing the circle the sky cracked asunder and a forked tree flashed and suddenly that black rain which can lose an entire archipelago in broad daylight was pouring tin nails on the roof hammering the balcony i closed the french window and thought of the horses in their stalls with one hoof tilted watching the ropes of rain i lay in bed with current gone from the bed-lamp and heard the roar of wind shaking the windows and i remembered achille on his own mattress and desperate hector trying to save his canoe i thought of helen as my island lost in the haze and i was sure i ’ d never see her again all of a sudden the rain stopped and i heard the sluicing of water down the guttering i opened the window when the sun came out it replaced the tiny brooms of palms on the ridges on the red galvanized roof of the paddock the wet sparkled then the grooms led the horses over the new grass and exercised them again and there was a different brightness in everything in the leaves in the horses ’ eyes ii i smelt the leaves threshing at the top of the year in green january over the orange villas and military barracks where the plunketts were the harbour flecked by the wind that comes with christmas edged with the arctic that was christened vent noël it stayed until march and with luck until easter it freshened the cedars waxed the laurier-cannelle and hid the african swift i smelt the drizzle on the asphalt leaving the morne it was the smell of an iron on damp cloth i heard the sizzle of fried jackfish in oil with their coppery skin i smelt ham studded with cloves the crusted accra the wax in the varnished parlour come in come in the arm of the morris chair sticky with lacquer i saw a sail going out and a sail coming in and a breeze so fresh it lifted the lace curtains like a petticoat like a sail towards ithaca i smelt a dead rivulet in the clogged drains iii ah twin-headed january seeing either tense a past they assured us born in degradation and a present that lifted us up with the wind ’ s noise in the breadfruit leaves with such an elation that it contradicts what is past the cannonballs of rotting breadfruit from the battle of the saints the asterisks of bulletholes in the brick walls of the redoubt i lived there with every sense i smelt with my eyes i could see with my nostrils chapter xlv i one side of the coast plunges its precipices into the atlantic turns require wide locks since the shoulder is sharp and the curve just misses a long drop over the wind-bent trees and the rocks between the trees there is a wide view of dennery with its stone church and raw ochre cliffs at whose base the african breakers end across the flecked sea whose combers veil and unveil the rocks with their lace the next port is dakar the uninterrupted wind thuds under the wings of frigates you see them bent from a force that has crossed the world tilting to find purchase in the sudden downdrafts of its current the breeze threshed the palms on the cool december road where the comet hurtled with empty leopard seats so fast a man on a donkey trying to read its oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo played when it screeched round a bridge and began to ascend away from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend where hector suddenly saw the trotting piglet and thought of plunkett ’ s warning as he heard it screel with the same sound that the tires of the comet made rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel the rear wheels spin to a dead stop like a helm the piglet trots down the safer side of the road lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame hector had both hands on the wheel his head was bowed under the swaying statue of the madonna of the rocks her smile swayed under the blue hood and when her fluted robe stilled the smile stayed on her dimpled porcelain she saw in the bowed man the calm common oval of prayer the head ’ s usual angle over the pew of the dashboard her lifted palm small as a doll ’ s from its cerulean mantle indicated that he had prayed enough to the lace of foam round the cliff ’ s altar that now if he wished he could lift his head but he stayed in the same place the way a man will remain when mass is finished not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross forehead heart and shoulders swiftly and then kneel facing the altar he bowed in endless remorse for her mercy at what he had done to achille his brother but his arc was over for the course of every comet is such the fated crescent was printed on the road by the scorching tires a salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped the wheel on the flecked sea the uninterrupted wind herded the long african combers and whipped the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead ii drivers leant over the rail one seized my luggage off the porter ’ s cart the rest burst into patois with gestures of despair at the lost privilege of driving me then turned to other customers in the evening pastures horses grazed their hides wet with light that shot its lances over the combers i had the transport all to myself “ you all set good a good pal of mine died in that chariot of his called the comet. ” he turned in the front seat spinning the air with his free hand i sat sprawled out in the back discouraging talk with my crossed feet “ you never know when eh i was at the airport that day i see him take off like a rocket i always said that thing have too much horsepower and so said so done the same hotel chief correct ” i saw the coastal villages receding as the highway ’ s tongue translated bush into forest the wild savannah into moderate pastures that other life going in its “ change for the best ” its peace paralyzed in a postcard a concrete future ahead of it all in the cinder-blocks of hotel development with the obsolete craft of the carpenter as i sensed in the neat marinas the fisherman ’ s phantom old oarlocks and rusting fretsaw my craft required the same crouching care the same crabbed natural devotion of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame or planed an elegant canoe its time was gone with the spirit in the wood as wood grew obsolete and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete i watched the afternoon sea didn ’ t i want the poor to stay in the same light so that i could transfix them in amber the afterglow of an empire preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks to that blue bus-stop didn ’ t i prefer a road from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax of colonial travellers the measured prose i read as a schoolboy that cove with its brown shallows there praslin that heron had they waited for me to develop my craft why hallow that pretence of preserving what they left the hypocrisy of loving them from hotels a biscuit-tin fence smothered in love-vines scenes to which i was attached as blindly as plunkett with his remorseful research art is history ’ s nostalgia it prefers a thatched roof to a concrete factory and the huge church above a bleached village the gap between the driver and me increased when he said “ the place changing eh ” where an old rumshop had gone but not that river with its clogged shadows that would make me a stranger “ all to the good ” he said i said “ all to the good ” then “ whoever they are ” to myself i caught his eyes in the mirror we were climbing out of micoud hadn ’ t i made their poverty my paradise his back could have been hector ’ s ferrying tourists in the other direction home the leopard seat scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests he had driven his burnt-out cargo tired of sweat who longed for snow on the moon and didn ’ t have to face the heat of that sinking sun who knew a climate as monotonous as this one could only produce from its unvarying vegetation flashes of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies that shot from the verge that their dried calabashes of fake african masks for a fake achilles rattled with the seeds that came from other men ’ s minds so let them think that who needed art in this place where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines and the fishermen had such adept thumbs such grace these people had but what they envied most in them was the calypso part the caribbean lilt still in the shells of their ears like the surf ’ s rhythm until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt like any eden and they sighed at the sign hewannorra iounalao the gold sea flat as a credit-card extending its line to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else greece or hawaii now the goddamn souvenir felt absurd excessive the painted gourds the shells their own faces as brown as gourds mine felt as strange as those at the counter feeling their bodies change iii change lay in our silence we had come to that bend where the trees are warped by wind and the cliffs raw shelve surely to foam “ is right here everything end ” the driver said and rammed open the transport door on his side then mine “ anyway chief the view nice. ” i joined him at the gusting edge “ his name was hector. ” the name was bent like the trees on the precipice to point inland in its echo a man-o ’ -war screamed on the wind the driver moved off for a piss then shouted over his shoulder “ a road-warrior he would drive like a madman when the power took he had a nice woman maybe he died for her. ” for her and tourism i thought the driver shook himself zipping then hoisting his crotch “ crazy but a gentle fellow anyway with a very good brain. ” cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain across serengeti cut to the spraying fans drummed by a riderless stallion its wild mane scaring the scamander cut to a woman ’ s hands clenched towards her mouth with no sound cut to the wheel of a chariot ’ s spiked hubcap cut to the face of his muscling jaw then flashback to achille hurling a red tin and a cutlass next a vase with a girl ’ s hoarse whisper echoing “ omeros ” as in a conch-shell cut to a shield of silver rolling like a hubcap rewind in slow motion myrmidons gathering by a village river with lances for oars cut to the surpliced ocean droning its missal cut a crane hoisting a wreck a horse nosing the surf then shuddering its neck he ’ d paid the penalty of giving up the sea as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed for the taxi-business he was making money but all of that money was making him ashamed of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf hustling passengers he missed the uncertain sand under his feet he sighed for the trough of a wave and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans castries was corrupting him with its roaring life its littered market with too many transport vans competing castries had been his common-law wife who like helen he had longed for from a distance and now he had both but a frightening discontent hollowed his face to find that the sea was a love he could never lose made every gesture violent ramming the side-door shut raking the clutch he drove as if driven by furies but furies paid the rent a man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother mer was both mother and sea in his lost canoe he had said his prayers but now he was in another kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new stereo its endless garages where he could not whip off his shirt hearing the conch ’ s summoning note chapter xlvi i hector was buried near the sea he had loved once not too far from the shallows where he fought achille for a tin and helen he did not hear the sea-almond ’ s moan over the bay when philoctete blew the shell nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud nor a sail rattling to rest as its day ’ s work was over and its mate gauging depth bent over the gunwale then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough when it was their turn to lie quiet as hector lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth ’ s trough to sleep under the piled conchs through every weather on the violet-wreathed mound crouching for his friend to hear achille whispered about their ancestral river and those things he would recognize when he got there his true home forever and ever and ever forever compère then philoctete limped over and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder to anchor his sorrow seven seas and helen did not come nearer achille had carried an oar to the church and propped it outside with the red tin now his voice strengthened he said “ mate this is your spear ” and laid the oar slowly the same way he had placed the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier the day the african swift and its shadow raced and this was the prayer that achille could not utter “ the spear that i give you my friend is only wood vexation is past i know how well you treat her you never know my admiration when you stood crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe with the plates of your chest like a shield i would say any enemy so was a compliment ’ cause no african ever hurled his wide seine at the bay by which he was born with such beauty you hear me men did not know you like me all right sleep good good night. ” achille moved philoctete ’ s hand then he saw helen standing alone and veiled in the widowing light then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin to her helen nodded a wind blew out the sun ii pride set in helen ’ s face after this like a stone bracketed with hector ’ s name her lips were incised by its dates in parenthesis she seemed more stern more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed the hot street of the village like a distant sail on the horizon grief heightened her when she smiled it was with such distance that it was hard to tell if she had heard your condolence it was the child ma kilman told them that made her more beautiful iii the rites of the island were simplified by its elements which changed places the grooved sea was achille ’ s garden the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense of the sea and philoctete on his height often heard in a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches on the blue heights at sunrise doing the same work as philoctete clearing his plot just as at sunset smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if from his enamel pot the woodsmoke smelt of a regret that men can not name on the charred field the massive sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers and the great indigo dusk slowly plumed down devouring the still leaves igniting the firefly huts lifting the panicky egret to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves take in the spars of its sails then with quick-pricking head anchor itself shiftingly and lift its question again at night the island reversed its elements the heron of a quarter-moon floated from hector ’ s grave rain rose upwards from the sea and the corrugated iron of the sea glittered with nailheads ragged plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers over the furrows of philoctete ’ s garden a chorus of aged ancestors and straw and rustling surrounded every house in the village with its back garden with its rank midden of rusted chamber pots rotting nets and the moon ’ s cold basin they sounded when they shook after the moonlit meridian of their crossing like the night-surf they gazed in silence at the shadows of their lamplit children at philoctete groaning and soaking the flower on his shin with hot sulphur cleaning its edges with yellow vaseline and gripping his knee squeezing rags from the basin at night when yards are asleep and the broken line of the surf hisses like philo “ bon dieu aie waie my sin is this sore ” the old plantains suffer and shine chapter xlvii i islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath of a cauldron a sibylline cure the citron sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half dipped its divining rod the white spray of the thorn which the swift bends lightly waited for a black hand to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand ma kilman in a black hat with its berried fringe eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step of the rumshop ’ s back door closed it and rammed the hinge tight the bolt caught a finger and with that her instep arch twisted and she let out a soft catholic curse then crossed herself she closed the gate the asphalt sweated with the heat the limp breadfruit leaves were thick over the fence her spectacles swam in their sweat she plucked an armpit the damn wig was badly made she was going to five o ’ clock mass to la messe and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze in the church ’ s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes she rolled down the elastic bands below the knees of her swollen stockings it was then that their vise round her calves reminded her of philoctete then numbering her beads she began her own litany of berries hail mary marigolds that stiffen their aureoles in the heights mild anemone and clear watercress the sacred heart of jesus pierced like the anthurium the thorns of logwood called the tree of life the aloe good for seizures the hole in the daisy ’ s palm with its drying blood that was the hole in the fisherman ’ s shin since he was pierced by a hook there was the pale roadside tisane of her malarial childhood there was this one for easing a birth-breach that one for a love-bath before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun ripened like her nipples in girlhood but what path led through nettles to the cure the furious sibyl couldn ’ t remember mimosa winced from her fingers shutting like jalousies at some passing evil when she reached for them the smell of incense lingers in her clothes inside the candle-flames are erect round the bier of the altar while she and her friends old-talk on the steps but the plant keeps its secret when her memory reaches shuttering in its fronds ii the dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings of perpetual freshness in which the bearded arms of a cedar held council between its gnarled toes grew the reek of an unknown weed its pronged flower sprang like a buried anchor its windborne odours diverted the bee from its pollen but its power rooted in bitterness drew her bowed head by the nose as a spike does a circling bull to approach it ma kilman lowered her head to one side and screened the stench with a cologned handkerchief the mulch it was rooted in carried the smell when it gangrened of philoctete ’ s cut in her black dress her berried black hat she climbed a goat-path up from the village past the stones with dried palms and conchs where the buried suffer the sun all day sunday while goats forage the new wreaths once more she pulled at the itch in her armpits nearly dropping her purse then she climbed hard up the rain-cracked path the bay closing behind her like a wound and rested everything that echoed repeated its outline a goat ’ s doddering bleat a hammer multiplying a roof and through the back yards a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat ma kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards to the thread of the smell one arm behind her back passing the cactus the thorn trees and then the wood appeared over her thick green the green almost black as her dress in its shade its border of flowers flecking the pasture with spray then she staggered back from the line of ants at her feet she saw the course they had kept behind her following her from church signalling a language she could not recognize iii a swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach centuries ago from its antipodal shore skimming the sea-troughs outdarting ospreys her luck held to its shadow she aimed to carry the cure that precedes every wound the reversible bight of benin was her bow her target the ringed haze of a circling horizon the star-grains at night made her hungrier the leafless sea with no house for her weariness sometimes she dozed in her flight for a swift ’ s second closing the seeds of her stare then ruddering straight the dry sea-flakes whitened her breast her feathers thinned then one dawn the day-star rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong east she saw the horned island and uncurled her claws with one frail cry since swifts are not given to song and fluttered down to a beach ejecting the seed in grass near the sand she nestled in dry seaweed in a year she was bleached bone all of that motion a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will but the vine grew its own wings out of the ocean it climbed like the ants the ancestors of achille the women carrying coals after the dark door slid over the hold as the weed grew in odour so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar where the flower was anchored at the mottled root as a lizard crawled upwards foot by sallow foot

i grieve and dare not show my discontent i love and yet am forced to seem to hate i do yet dare not say i ever meant i seem stark mute but inwardly do prate i am and not i freeze and yet am burned since from myself another self i turned my care is like my shadow in the sun follows me flying flies when i pursue it stands and lies by me doth what i have done his too familiar care doth make me rue it no means i find to rid him from my breast till by the end of things it be supprest some gentler passion slide into my mind for i am soft and made of melting snow or be more cruel love and so be kind let me or float or sink be high or low or let me live with some more sweet content or die and so forget what love ere meant
when the first mechanical picker had stripped the field it left such a copious white dross of disorderly wispiness that my mother could not console herself to the waste and insisted on having it picked over with human hands though anyone could see there was not enough for ten sheets and the hands had long since gone into the factories no matter how often my father pointed this out she worried it the way i ’ ve worried the extra words in poems that i conceived with the approximate notion that each stanza should have the same number of lines and each line the same number of syllables— and disregarded it telling myself a ripple or botch on the surface like the stutter of a speaker is all i have to affirm the deep fluency below the hebrews distrusted greek poetry which embodied harmony and symmetry and therefore revision not for aesthetic reasons but because they believed that to change the first words which rose unsmelted from the trance amounted to sacrilege against god in countries where because of the gross abundance of labor it ’ s unlawful to import harvesting machines i see the women in the fields and think of how when my mother used to pick you could tell her row by the bare stalks and the scant poundage that tumbled from her sack so pristinely white and devoid of burrs it seemed to have already passed through the spiked mandibles of the gin dr. williams said of eliot that his poems were so cautiously wrought that they seemed to come to us already digested in all four stomachs of the cow what my father loved about my mother was not just the beauty of her body and face but the practice of her ideas and the intelligence of her hands as they made the house that abides in us still as worry and bother but also the perfect freedom beyond— as cleanliness is next to godliness but is not god
for jean brockway when the walkers-on-water went under the bog-walkers came out of the barberry thickets booted in gum to their hips in a corona of midges their ears electric with sound beating the stale of the swamp with their whips and flailing the ground for the itch under the frond the fern ’ s demonology the mosquito ’ s decibel night-sweat clotted their palms they tasted their gall the sumac flickered a swatch of its leaves in the lichens and venoms a dazzle was seen in the fog as a vegetal world gave way to a uterine pitch pulled at their heels and blackened their knuckles the bog-laurel ’ s fan opened its uttermost decimal and showed them the bog paradisal beyond purpose or menace dewed like the flesh of an apple with the damp of creation the disk of the pond glowed under the dragonfly ’ s bosses where a faulting of glaciers had left it—vaults of bog-rosemary buckbean and labrador tea a dapple of leavening mosses soaking in ice-water peat-wicks feeding their gas to the cranberry braziers they entered the bonfire together the moss took their weight like a trampoline they walked on the sponge and bitumen without leaving a footprint in between in the vats of mat-roses where the waterline closed like a skin the ambiguous world of imbalance non-being the pre-human and tentative was one with the ludicrous the quaking began—under their bootsoles at first like a whale under ambergris then cramming their wrists with a drummer ’ s vibrations knocking their ribs and their knees as all sagged and rebounded they lurched on the wet as though tracing a profile of breakers or displacing the cords and the voids of a net and staggered back into their childhoods till their feet touched the granite again the bog tossed them over the threshold that opened a path in the spruce toward the opposite edges the leaves closed behind them they walked an unyielding and tangible world like strangers remembering only the hovering glare where the pitcher-plant ’ s hammer closed on the fly—the light shaking and shaking— as a pulse touched their feet from below and passed over
how much grit do you think you ’ ve got can you quit a thing that you like a lot you may talk of pluck it ’ s an easy word and where ’ er you go it is often heard but can you tell to a jot or guess just how much courage you now possess you may stand to trouble and keep your grin but have you tackled self-discipline have you ever issued commands to you to quit the things that you like to do and then when tempted and sorely swayed those rigid orders have you obeyed don ’ t boast of your grit till you ’ ve tried it out nor prate to men of your courage stout for it ’ s easy enough to retain a grin in the face of a fight there ’ s a chance to win but the sort of grit that is good to own is the stuff you need when you ’ re all alone how much grit do you think you ’ ve got can you turn from joys that you like a lot have you ever tested yourself to know how far with yourself your will can go if you want to know if you have grit just pick out a joy that you like and quit it ’ s bully sport and it ’ s open fight it will keep you busy both day and night for the toughest kind of a game you ’ ll find is to make your body obey your mind and you never will know what is meant by grit unless there ’ s something you ’ ve tried to quit

i ran into the afterlife no fluffy white clouds not even stars only sky dark as the inside of a movie theater at three in the afternoon and getting bigger all the time expanding at terrific speed over the car which was disappearing flattening out empty as the fields on either side it was impossible to think under that rain louder than engines i turned off the radio to listen let my head fill up until every bone was vibrating—sky twice trees of lightning broke out of the asphalt i could smell the highway burning long after saw blue smoke twirling behind the eyeballs lariats doing fancy rope tricks jerking silver dollars out of the air along with billiard cues ninepins i was starting to feel i could drive forever when suddenly one of those trees was right in front of me of course i hit it— branches shooting stars down the windshield poor car shaking like a dazed cow i thought this time for sure i was dead so whatever was on the other side had to be eternity saw sky enormous as nowhere kept on driving

at sunset from the top of the stair watching the castle mallets wrenched from their socket fell from ambush into flame flew into hiding above the stoneware a latch like muscle hid the green he stood waist high under the rapt ceiling and hanged the sparrow where the kitchen had been a mirror of eggs served in a tumbler he saw the ring when a lancet pierced and threw it in a basket and lowered it where sails enter the harbor over a parchment like dominoes the petrel-like eyelash to the sun and its rites were pulled the dried banners they flew past the ruins the tower and window where ivory guided the mist on his back he rubbed his eyes and counted them kneeling wrinkled as grass a ghost in their nostrils put a heel at their forehead they saw only the moon as it fasted ii if the ship meant anything if he heard a world view in the midst of his rhythm or the spell lustrous like hair on his arm that groaned as it struck near the tumble down or combing hair words burnt as they quickened the bitter they share crept into forage and muster is in their skin the grey worked like a vise they brushed this to turn arrows they shut off the vast cellar and the turret leaped to a pattern the mosaic blended was untouched iii the frankish hills and hummocks metered the greed over sun and cloud voluptuous in the straits turbanned held scarves to the water each sail embroidered who washed in their music a lattice a major or borrowed sky this aspect provides the lily stalk inside the frame a gesture the lily pointing north as if the wrench from sky decides cold rain or change of tide the lily she chooses iv waking in must the high pierced window dew on the furnaced bar the poaching hour the cup takes smoke from the tower they drink in the smoke the print cradled cut in dark the siege made cloth a transfer learned from invaders who craved it spindle thieves she sang high notes and pebbles went into her work where it changed into marks in that room the armor-like wrens rites turned with thread a dower begs lapis eglantine on a spoon the castle breeds tallow v a change of tide might delay the run they watched as if by simple water read magisterially whatever the book decided night outside covered with filmic screen ghosts they store then bring an experimental wheel out of hiding even the nile wind fortune cards jugglers a remedy from old clothes to appease the fable—pearls rolling in straw the way a cowslip bends they remember or troilus as he stared they agree on brighter covers looser shifts fluent tower to tower more ephemeral than roundness or the grown pear tree connected with vision a rose briar vi there was only a rugged footpath above the indifferent straits and a shelf where the castle lay perhaps it was sphered like otranto there the traveller stood naked and talked aloud or found a lily and thought a sword or dragged a carcass upon blunt stone like a corded animal in weeds in spiritual seclusion a felt hand lifted
highlight actions disable annotations i met a traveller from an antique land who said— “ two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert near them on the sand half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor well those passions read which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed and on the pedestal these words appear my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair nothing beside remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away ”
the cheese-mites asked how the cheese got there and warmly debated the matter the orthodox said that it came from the air and the heretics said from the platter they argued it long and they argued it strong and i hear they are arguing now but of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese not one of them thought of a cow
the greeks are sitting on the beach wondering what to do when the war ends no one wants to go home back to that bony island everyone wants a little more of what there is in troy more life on the edge that sense of every day as being packed with surprises but how to explain this to the ones at home to whom fighting a war is a plausible excuse for absence whereas exploring one ’ s capacity for diversion is not well this can be faced later these are men of action ready to leave insight to the women and children thinking things over in the hot sun pleased by a new strength in their forearms which seem more golden than they did at home some begin to miss their families a little to miss their wives to want to see if the war has aged them and a few grow slightly uneasy what if war is just a male version of dressing up a game devised to avoid profound spiritual questions ah but it wasn ’ t only the war the world had begun calling them an opera beginning with the war ’ s loud chords and ending with the floating aria of the sirens there on the beach discussing the various timetables for getting home no one believed it could take ten years to get back to ithaca no one foresaw that decade of insoluble dilemmas—oh unanswerable affliction of the human heart how to divide the world ’ s beauty into acceptable and unacceptable loves on the shores of troy how could the greeks know they were hostages already who once delays the journey is already enthralled how could they know that of their small number some would be held forever by the dreams of pleasure some by sleep some by music
while spoon-feeding him with one hand she holds his hand with her other hand or rather lets it rest on top of his which is permanently clenched shut when he turns his head away she reaches around and puts in the spoonful blind he will not accept the next morsel until he has completely chewed this one his bright squint tells her he finds the shrimp she has just put in delicious next to the voice and touch of those we love food may be our last pleasure on earth— a man on death row takes his t-bone in small bites and swishes each sip of the jug wine around in his mouth tomorrow will be too late for them to jolt this supper out of him she strokes his head very slowly as if to cheer up each separate discomfited hair sticking up from its root in his stricken brain standing behind him she presses her cheek to his kisses his jowl and his eyes seem to stop seeing and do nothing but emit light could heaven be a time after we are dead of remembering the knowledge flesh had from flesh the flesh of his face is hard perhaps from years spent facing down others until they fell back and harder from years of being himself faced down and falling back in his turn and harder still from all the while frowning and beaming and worrying and shouting and probably letting go in rages his face softens into a kind of quizzical wince as if one of the other animals were working at getting the knack of the human smile when picking up a cookie he uses both thumbtips to grip it and push it against an index finger to secure it so that he can lift it she takes him then to the bathroom where she lowers his pants and removes the wet diaper and holds the spout of the bottle to his old penis until he pisses all he can then puts on the fresh diaper and pulls up his pants when they come out she is facing him walking backwards in front of him and holding his hands pulling him when he stops reminding him to step when he forgets and starts to pitch forward she is leading her old father into the future as far as they can go and she is walking him back into her childhood where she stood in bare feet on the toes of his shoes and they foxtrotted on this same rug i watch them closely she could be teaching him the last steps that one day she may teach me at this moment he glints and shines as if it will be only a small dislocation for him to pass from this paradise into the next

i. until jove let it be no colonist mastered the wild earth no land was marked none parceled out or shared but everyone looked for his living in the common world and jove gave poison to the blacksnakes and made the wolves ravage made the ocean roll knocked honey from the leaves took fire away— so man might beat out various inventions by reasoning and art first he chipped fire out of the veins of flint where it was hidden then rivers felt his skiffs of the light alder then sailors counted up the stars and named them pleiades hyades and the pole star then were discovered ways to take wild things in snares or hunt them with the circling pack and how to whip a stream with casting nets or draw the deep-sea fisherman ’ s cordage up and then the use of steel and the shrieking saw then various crafts all things were overcome by labor and by force of bitter need ii even when your threshing floor is leveled by the big roller smoothed and packed by hand with potter ’ s clay so that it will not crack there are still nuisances the tiny mouse locates his house and granary underground or the blind mole tunnels his dark chamber the toad too and all monsters of the earth besides those plunderers of the grain the weevil and frantic ant scared of a poor old age let me speak then too of the farmer ’ s weapons the heavy oaken plow and the plowshare the slowly rolling carts of demeter the threshing machine the sledge the weighted mattock the withe baskets the cheap furniture the harrow and the magic winnowing fan— all that your foresight makes provision of if you still favor the divine countryside iii moreover like men tempted by the straits in ships borne homeward through the blowing sea we too must reckon on arcturus star the days of luminous draco and the kids when libra makes the hours of sleep and daylight equal dividing the world half light half dark then drive the team and sow the field with barley even under intractable winter ’ s rain but spring is the time to sow your beans and clover when shining taurus opens the year with his golden horns and the dog ’ s averted star declines for greater harvests of your wheat and spelt let first the pleiades and hyades be hid and ariadne ’ s diadem go down the golden sun rules the great firmament through the twelve constellations and the world is measured out in certain parts and heaven by five great zones is taken up entire one glowing with sundazzle and fierce heat and far away on either side the arctics frozen with ice and rain cerulean and in between two zones for sick mankind through each of these a slanting path is cut where pass in line the zodiacal stars northward the steep world rises to scythia and south of libya descends where black styx and the lowest of the dead look on in the north sky the snake glides like a river winding about the great and little bear— those stars that fear forever the touch of ocean southward they say profound night mother of furies sits tight-lipped among the crowding shades or thence aurora draws the daylight back and where the east exhales the yellow morning reddening evening lights her stars at last iv as for the winter when the freezing rains confine the farmer he may employ himself in preparations for serener seasons the plowman beats the plowshare on the forge or makes his vats of tree-trunks hollowed out brands his cattle numbers his piles of grain sharpens fence posts or pitchforks prepares umbrian trellises for the slow vine then you may weave the baskets of bramble twigs or dip your bleating flock in the clean stream often the farmer loads his little mule with olive oil or apples and brings home a grindstone or a block of pitch from market and some will stay up late beside the fire on winter nights whittling torches while the housewife runs the shuttle through the loom and comforts the long labor with her singing or at the stove she simmers the new wine skimming the froth with leaves oh idle time in that hale season all their worries past farmers arrange convivialities— as after laden ships have reached home port the happy sailors load the prow with garlands then is the time to gather acorns and laurel berries and the bloodred myrtle to lay your traps for cranes and snares for buck to hit the fallow deer with twisted slingshots and track the long-eared hare— when snow is deep and ice is on the rivers v. what of the humors and the ways of autumn just when the farmer wished to reap his yellow fields and thresh his grain i have often seen all the winds make war flattening the stout crops from the very roots and in the black whirlwind carrying off the ears and the light straw and often mighty phalanxes of rain marched out of heaven as the clouds rolled up from the sea the detestable tempest then the steep aether thundered and the deluge soaked the crops filled ditches made the rivers rise and roar and seethe in their spuming beds the father himself in the mid stormy night lets the lightning go at whose downstroke enormous earth quivers wild things flee and fear abases the prone hearts of men— as jove splits athos with his firebolt or rhodopê or the ceraunian ridge the southwind wails in sheets of rain and under that great wind the groves lament and the long breast of the shore is shaken if you dislike to be so caught mark well the moon ’ s phases and the weather signs notice where saturn ’ s frigid star retires mercury ’ s wanderings over heaven and revere especially the gods offer to ceres annual sacrifice and annual worship in the first fair weather of the spring so may your sheep grow fat and your vines fruitful your sleep sweet and your mountains full of shade let all the country folk come to adore her and offer her libations of milk and wine conduct the sacrificial lamb three times around the ripe field in processional with all your chorus singing out to ceres and let no man lay scythe against his grain unless he first bind oakleaves on his head and make his little dance and sing to her vi when shall we herd the cattle to the stables the wind say rises without intermission the sea gets choppy and the swell increases the dry crash of boughs is heard on hills the long sound of the surf becomes a tumult the gusts become more frequent in the grove the waves begin to fight against the keels from far at sea the gulls fly shoreward crying the heron leaves his favorite marsh and soars over the high cloud then you will see beyond thin skimrack shooting stars falling the long pale tracks behind them whitening through the darkness of the night and you ’ ll see straw and fallen leaves blowing but when it thunders in rough boreas ’ quarter when east and west it thunders—every sailor furls his dripping sail a storm should never catch you unprepared aerial cranes take flight before its rising the restless heifer with dilated nostrils sniffs the air the squeaking hirondelle flits round and round the lake and frogs inveterate in their mud croak a chorale and too the ant more frantic in his gallery trundles his eggs out from their hiding place the rainbow cloud imbiber may be seen and crows go cawing from the pasture in a harsh throng of crepitating wings the jeering jay gives out his yell for rain and takes a walk by himself on the dry sand stormwise the various sea-fowl and such birds as grub the sweet swan river in asia may be observed dousing themselves and diving or riding on the water as if they wished— what odd exhilaration—to bathe themselves vii after a storm clear weather and continuing sunny days may likewise be foretold by the sharp twinkle of the stars the moon rising to face her brother ’ s rays by day no tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky no halcyons sea favorites on the shore stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight but mists go lower and lie on the fields the owl observing sundown from his perch modulates his meaningless melancholy aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk chases his prey and as she flits aside the fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind and as he swoops she flits aside again with funereal contractions of the windpipe the crows produce their caws three at a time and in their high nests pleased at i know not what noise it among themselves no doubt rejoicing to see their little brood after the storm but not i think by reason of divine insight or superior grasp of things viii but if you carefully watch the rapid sun and the moon following a fair night ’ s snare never deceives you as to next day ’ s weather when the new moon collects a rim of light if that bow be obscured with a dark vapor then a great tempest is in preparation if it be blushing like a virgin ’ s cheek there will be wind wind makes diana blush if on the fourth night most significant she goes pure and unclouded through the sky all that day and the following days will be for one full month exempt from rain and wind the sun too rising and setting in the waves will give you weather signs trustworthy ones whether at morning or when stars come out a mackerel sky over the east at sunrise means look out for squalls a gale is coming unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks or when through denser strata the sun ’ s rays break out dimly or aurora rises pale from tithonus ’ crocus-colored chamber alas the vine-leaf will not shield the cluster in the hubbub of roof-pattering bitter hail it will be well to notice sunset too for the sun ’ s visage then has various colors bluish and dark means rain if it be fiery that means an east wind if it be dappled and mixed with red gold light then you will see wind and rain in commotion everywhere nobody can advise me on that night to cast off hawsers and put out to sea but if the next day passes and the sunset then be clear you need not fear the weather a bright norther will sway the forest trees ix last what the late dusk brings and whence the fair clouds are blown and secrets of the southwind you may learn from the sun whose prophecies no man denies seeing black insurrections treacheries and wars are told by him when caesar died the great sun pitied rome so veiling his bright head the godless time trembled in fear of everlasting night and then were portents given of earth and ocean vile dogs upon the roads and hideous strange birds and aetna quaking and her fires bursting to overflow the cyclops ’ fields with flames whirled in the air and melted stones thunder of war was heard in germany from south to north shaking the granite alps and a voice also through the silent groves piercing and apparitions wondrous pale were seen in dead of night then cattle spoke o horror streams stood still the earth cracked open and tears sprang even from the temple bronze the po monarch of rivers on his back spuming whole forests raced through the lowland plains and bore off pens and herds and then continually the viscera of beasts were thick with evil blood trickled from the springs tall towns at night re-echoed to the wolf-pack ’ s shivering howl and never from pure heaven have there fallen so many fires nor baleful comets burned it seemed that once again the roman lines alike in arms would fight at philippi and heaven permitted those thessalian fields to be enriched again with blood of ours some future day perhaps in that country a farmer with his plow will turn the ground and find the javelins eaten thin with rust or knock the empty helmets with his mattock and wonder digging up those ancient bones paternal gods ancestors mother vesta you that guard tiber and the palatine now that long century is overthrown let not this young man fail to give us peace long enough beneath your rule o caesar heaven has hated us and all those triumphs where justice was thrown down—so many wars so many kinds of wickedness no honor rendered the plow but the fields gone to ruin the country-folk made homeless and their scythes beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge war from the euphrates to germany ruptured engagements violence of nations and impious mars raging the whole world over— as when a four horsed chariot rears away plunging from the barrier and runs wild heedless of the reins or the charioteer

raymond roussel two girls runaway from the home they have a revolver in their possession the sisters of our lady have given up looking for them returning in the night with soft candles the sleek clouds have thrown their riders and the bees are returning to the honey the clover at the edge of the cliff black as eyelids damp as blue mussels flexing at the moon the girls look in the stolen mirror then throw their shoes in the sea they take off one another ’ s dress posing on the rocks that jut out over the faded water of the last days the clover beat down from their splendid feet the clover quiet like a vault nearby in a ship named for early death i drink wine like a city anchored far off the continent of love strange but bees do not die in their own honey and how the dead are toted off how the sweet moons are deposited in the catacombs the clover at the edge of the sea like a chemise place where animals have lain they help one another with their hair their dresses blowing back to land they look over the cliff spit on the beach birds i have never seen going by
for years the scenes bustled through him as he dreamed he was alive then he felt real and slammed awake in the wet sheets screaming too fast everything moves too fast and the edges of things are gone four blocks away a baseball was a dot against the sky and he thought my glove is too big i will drop the ball and it will be a home run the snow falls too fast from the clouds and night is dropped and snatched back like a huge joke is that the ball or is it just a bird and the ball is somewhere else and i will miss it and the edges are gone my hands melt into the walls my hands do not end where the wall begins should i move forward or back or will the ball come right to me i know i will miss because i always miss when it takes so long the wall has no surface no edge the wall fades into the air and the air is my hand and i am the wall my arm is the syringe and thus i become the nurse i am you nurse if he gets around the bases before the ball comes down is it a home run even if i catch it if we could slow down and stop we would be one fused mass careening at too great a speed through the emptiness if i catch the ball our side will be up and i will have to bat and i might strike out
tiny bit of humanity blessed with your mother ’ s face and cursed with your father ’ s mind i say cursed with your father ’ s mind because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot and looking away through the ceiling of the room and beyond can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet why don ’ t you kick and howl and make the neighbors talk about “ that damned baby next door ” and make up your mind forthwith to grow up and be a banker or a politician or some other sort of go-getter or— —whatever you decide upon rid yourself of these incipient thoughts about being a poet for poets no longer are makers of songs chanters of the gold and purple harvest sayers of the glories of earth and sky of the sweet pain of love and the keen joy of living no longer dreamers of the essential dreams and interpreters of the eternal truth through the eternal beauty poets these days are unfortunate fellows baffled in trying to say old things in a new way or new things in an old language they talk abracadabra in an unknown tongue each one fashioning for himself a wordy world of shadow problems and as a self-imagined atlas struggling under it with puny legs and arms groaning out incoherent complaints at his load my son this is no time nor place for a poet grow up and join the big busy crowd that scrambles for what it thinks it wants out of this old world which is—as it is— and probably always will be take the advice of a father who knows you can not begin too young not to be a poet
ventura because she was hungry and because she was curious—but more because she was curious— took the dare a kiss for a pomegranate everyone gathered her friends and his everyone watched the boys the girls the pigs and the chickens and more moving to the front were the children she and clemente would one day have and the children of those children too gathered and loud with everyone and everything else loud as the pigs and fast as the chickens though she could not see them still they crowded her and she could feel their anxious breathing this boy clemente whom she would kiss she would have kissed even without the pomegranate though she could not say it and was glad of this game he suited her she thought he had a strong face he felt what she felt she could see him look around but not at their friends she could see him feel the shiver of the children they would have their son margarito his two sisters both of whom would become nuns if just to pray enough to take care of him this boy so serious he would seem like a stranger in their arms serious enough by himself to make up for clemente and ventura and for all the laughter they themselves would feel this curious child who as an old man would never trust a doctor for anything and his serious wife to come refugio and her sisters matilde and consuelo as well all the people who would follow this kiss so many of them and their children too everyone stood there arms up everyone watching so much noise in this moment this quick lending of herself to his cheek the way ventura would later kiss all these impatient children of theirs the kiss seemed so small but was filled with itself this small moment of affection she gave this boy the quarter-second that it took there they all stood waiting with the crowd egging them on hefting the pomegranate and pushing them toward each other clemente and ventura in that quarter-second lived their lives a quarter-second not finished yet
always the sky keeps expanding wide as america ’ s brave margins wide as my loneliness in the middle west i lean against a dust cloud behind us the glory sinking into a muted timberline i am drunk with longing the wind is singing— my drunken friend the wind hurls sweet curses at my face we have learned to love this road which lies down like pythons refuses to forgive our excesses refuses to consider us kin our driver ’ s sign overhead reads jesus is my co-pilot jesus who crossed the city gates of his ancestors on a road carpeted by palms our goodtime driver must know this— he drives with abandon despite our fragile cargo scholars and accountants prophets and exiles all the same to him the road which suggests things is tired of ceremony it lies down to sleep like the snow lie down tallmountain lie down serafin syquia lie down li-young lie down divakaruni lie down eman lacaba lie down pilgrims of the open road shameless we gather our light jackets in balls we rest our heads our faces upturned to a squall of stars i near the end my soul recites o loneliness my body responds this empty road is a house where no one lives what strange fire we bring when we come to this house
dear folks smile enclosed is the ordinary river it is called “ that devil ” in whose name the locals are baptized finally that river twists like a hurt thing— they say it ’ s nothing it has become a new road in a naked place then i am nothing and it is that dream i dreamed i dreamed sincerely hello i have just passed “ doubt ” it is near “ milk teeth ” and “ nothing ” and “ falling out. ” there are flowers and evidence of ambiguous winds “ doubt ” is like a man walking in his sleep seriously offhand it reminds me of a jamesian novel with the motives the motives the motives have mercy say to get to innocence you take the narrow trail from deep you squeeze into the mountain ’ s waves if you meet savage rock it is the wrong way turn left there then in our hearts ’ honeymoon lay i. queequeg j.p. today is friday we are still on the hill called spirit of the wind but we are down real low like new flame just to be close dad baby g. sunday and what you are probably babbling i seem to see i.e at 60 mph this is the alfalfa field of my heart there is no museum here and in a convertible where birds can sing anything is possible dad milton there is a mountain called can she is blind with snow but all seers are blind what we need in the morning when we always see her and are always reborn is a magnificent horn and the strangely uneven voice of her life thanks bill i checked this out you know that ridge up there is north because you know for no reason except this a great wind blows behind it the stars come out virtually human and here you are apparently crude like the sound of a breaking string that seems to come from the sky so long

our father who art in heaven i am drunk again red wine for which i offer thanks i ought to start with praise but praise comes hard to me i stutter did i tell you about the woman whom i taught in bed this prayer it starts with praise the simple form keeps things in order i hear from her sometimes do you and after love when i was hungry i said make me something to eat she yelled poof you ’ re a casserole —and laughed so hard she fell out of the bed take care of her next confession—the dreary part at night deer drift from the dark woods and eat my garden they ’ re like enormous rats on stilts except of course they ’ re beautiful but why what makes them beautiful i haven ’ t shot one yet i might when i was twelve i ’ d ride my bike out to the dump and shoot the rats it ’ s hard to kill your rats our father you have to use a hollow point and hit them solidly a leg is not enough the rat won ’ t pause yeep yeep it screams and scrabbles three-legged back into the trash and i would feel a little bad to kill something that wants to live more savagely than i do even if it ’ s just a rat my garden ’ s vanishing perhaps i ’ ll merely plant more beans though that might mean more beautiful and hungry deer who knows i ’ m sorry for the times i ’ ve driven home past a black enormous twilight ridge crested with mist it looked like a giant wave about to break and sweep across the valley and in my loneliness and fear i ’ ve thought o let it come and wash the whole world clean forgive me this is my favorite sin despair— whose love i celebrate with wine and prayer our father thank you for all the birds and trees that nature stuff i ’ m grateful for good health food air some laughs and all the other things i ’ m grateful that i ’ ve never had to do without i have confused myself i ’ m glad there ’ s not a rattrap large enough for deer while at the zoo last week i sat and wept when i saw one elephant insert his trunk into another ’ s ass pull out a lump and whip it back and forth impatiently to free the goodies hidden in the lump i could have let it mean most anything but i was stunned again at just how little we ask for in our lives don ’ t look don ’ t look two young nuns tried to herd their giggling schoolkids away line up they called let ’ s go and watch the monkeys in the monkey house i laughed and got a dirty look dear lord we lurch from metaphor to metaphor which is—let it be so—a form of praying i ’ m usually asleep by now—the time for supplication requests as if i ’ d stayed up late and called the radio and asked they play a sentimental song embarrassed i want a lot of money and a woman and also i want vanishing cream you know— a character like popeye rubs it on and disappears although you see right through him he ’ s there he chuckles stumbles into things and smoke that ’ s clearly visible escapes from his invisible pipe it makes me think sometimes of you what makes me think of me is the poor jerk who wanders out on air and then looks down below his feet he sees eternity and suddenly his shoes no longer work on nothingness and down he goes as i fall past remember me
the limit of the song is this prelude to a journey to the outer islands the generative sentence waltz project forms qualities suns moons rings an inside-outside then an outside-inside shaped with her colored clays the days yet propse themselves as self-evident everything there everything here and you are reading in a way natural to theatre a set of instructions that alters itself automatically as you proceed west from death to friendliness the two topics upon which you are allowed to meditate under the first broad drops of rain the planes will be piloted by ancestors who have come back to life why the delay

it 's hard to get anywhere in utah without going through provo i ca n't tell you the number of times i went there as a teenager the number of times i drove into town in the early afternoon hungry and had to look around for a place to eat you do n't have to starve in provo but you eat at your own risk at no risk i would never have gone to provo on my own i went accompanied— for reasons almost too trivial—or personal—to mention there are moments when you simply must get into the car and drive and from salt lake there are only a few ways to go toward the great salt lake or toward the canyons and to get to zion or moab you had to pass through provo i remember the population because it went with the number of miles from outskirt to outskirt 45 miles 45,000 people 45 minutes keeping to the speed limit 45 to spend on a suit at a 45 discount ... there was nothing provo 's department store did not carry including pearl handled colt 45 's but for a wider selection of fire arms rifles with narrowing focal points with greater precision over vast distances you were better off next door o i guess it was n't that different from entering a thousand other american towns but this one made my flesh crawl i wanted to howl the men walked with their hands deep in their pockets the women were afraid to lift their eyes it was as if something terrible had happened or was about to happen i 'm not saying you have to love what you do in this life but it is n't nice to practice the silent treatment on strangers in the desert strangers who would have to be wondering where the other 44,990 people were since other than the one drowning potatoes in burning oil beside the grill in the luncheonette and the one behind the register and the three grim-faced parchment-skinned jack mormons hunkered over cups and the handful of impassive faces placed against the windows of one-story cinder-block houses there was no one in provo beyond the jackrabbits— glimpsed in abundance en route— who vanished as we crossed the town line and drove past the population sign or was it a warning in disguise there was something eerie in the air an absence i could not identify an immense single-pump gas station shimmering like a mirage in the heat took up a good part of the main drag i pull in step into the heat stunned the car is too hot to touch i needed gas but did n't want to get it there it meant digging up the attendant you know the lights in hospital corridors those are the lights in the gas station in provo they 're the kind of lights that show up whatever 's wrong with a face the kind of lights that make something wrong when there 's nothing wrong when i got there i was afraid it 's hard to put my finger on the precise reason why it 's not as though something ominous rose from the sidewalks or hell 's angels cycles were parked outside the luncheonette nothing like that nor can i say why even though there was almost no one on the street i felt watched while i slept fitfully in the tilt-back bucket seats someone scribbled obscenities on the headlights i felt drawn by destiny to this nadir you do n't want to provoke anyone in provo it 's that kind of place that kind of absence— the desert flattens out the plants draw in their antennae provo is not where you can hope to find boon companions it 's against the law to serve liquor in the bar and no one in the luncheonette looks up when you walk in these are the fallen sunk in ashes adrift in the smoke of unreason they have masturbated without shame they have coveted envied they have pocketed the tithe it 's hard to put it into words provo it 's more like a place without a name a desert stopover with the semblance of a town provo is a place where there is no reason to be a province that would never grow up to be a suburb like the backwaters where they exiled ovid and pascal only there is no water— just landscape shorn of green and tawny desert colors burned skyline hills like craggy impenetrable fortresses the rain gutters hiss in the dryness there 's a menacing blue tint on the rims of impinging mountains
there was always a lizard or a frog around the pump waiting for a little extra water or a butterfly to light jimmy said the pump gave him the worms i got the worms under the slick boards the pump would bite you in the winter it got hold of jimmy and wouldn ’ t let go the blades of johnson grass were tall and sharp around the pump stand i had to hoe them all the time nobody filled the prime jar though one time i cut the tongue out of a buster brown shoe and gave it to the pump it made a good sucker washer sometimes the pump seemed like jesus i liked bathing buck naked under the pump not in a goddamn washtub
seeing my friend ’ s son in his broad-brimmed hat and suspenders i think of the quakers who lectured us on nonviolent social action every week when i was a child in the classrooms we listened to those who would not take up arms who objected who had accepted alternative service in distant work camps and showed slides of hospitals they helped to build on wednesdays in meeting for worship when someone rose to speak all the energy in the room flew inside her mouth empowering her to tell what she had seen on her brief encounter with the divine sometimes a parable a riddle a kindness the fall that we were seventeen we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path from the meetinghouse while maple and elm leaves sailed around our shoulders like tiny envelopes our futures sealed inside despite the war in vietnam i felt safer than i ever would again perhaps those aged protective trees had cast a spell on us or maybe the nonviolent quaker god had set up a kingdom right there— suburban philadelphia looking back i see how good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic room for latin descended to the gym for sports where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds of righteous behavior we prepared to leave for college armed with the language of the american friends and the memories of thanksgiving dinners we ’ d cooked for the unfortunates borrowing our parents ’ cars to drive downtown to the drop-off point racing back to play our last field hockey match grim center forwards shook hands before the whistle the half-backs ’ knee-pads strapped on tight one varsity team vanquished another
it has arrived—the long rag rug multiply folded on top one alien hair i put my face to the folds and smell despair palpable as salt air in all those rooms and houses small and smug— enclosures i passed through on my way where whoever did the weaving appears old in my mind ’ s eye i can ’ t make out her face can only conjure up the faintest trace of an abstracted grace clack of the loom does she know they ’ ll be sold these precious things in some unheard-of place i perch her on a hill precariously beyond the reach of waves ’ daily boom sun blazes overhead but her dim room no bigger than the loom is proof against the violence of the sky from it i further spin what i once called my home endless horizons fading into haze the mornings dawn came up so rosy clear snails in the garden sheep bells everywhere the brightness of the air terraces valleys organizing space and time ’ s cessation so this package here i ’ m now unwrapping in new york today rugs like rainbows woven with a grace my strands of language barely can express dishrags of dailiness dispersed and recombined and freshly gay comes to me imbued with images slowly and faithfully across the water across the world it represents a time i myself snipped and recombined as rhyme as soon as i went home if that is where i am these rugs recover the sense of stepping twice into a single river

we were very tired we were very merry— we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry it was bare and bright and smelled like a stable— but we looked into a fire we leaned across a table we lay on a hill-top underneath the moon and the whistles kept blowing and the dawn came soon we were very tired we were very merry— we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry and you ate an apple and i ate a pear from a dozen of each we had bought somewhere and the sky went wan and the wind came cold and the sun rose dripping a bucketful of gold we were very tired we were very merry we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry we hailed “ good morrow mother ” to a shawl-covered head and bought a morning paper which neither of us read and she wept “ god bless you ” for the apples and pears and we gave her all our money but our subway fares

after reading ash wednesday she looked once at the baked beans and fled luncheonless poor girl she observed a kind of poetic lent— and i had thought i liked poetry better than she did i do but to me its most endearing quality is its unsuitableness and conversely the chief wonder in heaven whither i also am sometimes transported is the kind of baggage i bring with me surely there is no more exquisite jointure in the anatomy of life than that at which poetry dovetails with the inevitable meal and mrs. b. sits murmuring of avocados

today in rome heading down michelangelo ’ s spanish steps under an unchanging moon i held on to the balustrade grateful for his giving me a hand all for love i stumbled over the past as if it were my own feet here in my twenties i was lost in love and poetry along the tiber i made up cubist shakespearean games in writing even in those days i can not say it was popular to have “ subjects ” any more than painters used sitters but i did i played with an ignorant mirror for an audience my self embroiled with personae from antony and cleopatra delusions of grandeur they were for a time my foul-weather friends— as once i played with soldiers on the mountainous countryside of a purple blanket 2002

what i want most is what i deeply fear loss of self yet here i stand a “ memsahib ” all decked out in wonder and still a stranger amid the harvest old gaffar at my side here ’ s a pandit preaching in the flower stall he turns funeral wreaths into wheels of rapture i must shrug off my notion of knowing anything of substance about the world about the spirit sparrows dart between the columns like music huge pupae bananas split their golden skins flies moisten their hands in bands of dew lepers limp by on crutches in slow motion where is there order in the world none none i think—no order only spirals of power the pyramids of onion guava melon—all defy my reason they shine like galaxy-driven planets a balancing scale becomes a barge of plenty a cornucopia endlessly filling up and emptying the wages of sin are more sin virtue ’ s wages more virtue—and all such earnings weightless i ’ ve forgotten my errand i float now through myself like a howl through a phantom mouth— the world ’ s an illusory marketplace where i must bargain hardest for what i hope i ’ m worth
it ’ s a fine fact that whenever i sit in a tavern corner sipping a grappa the pederast ’ s there or the kids with their screaming or the unemployed guy or some beautiful girl outside—all breaking the thread of my smoke that ’ s how it is kid i ’ m telling it straight i work at lucento but that voice that sorrowful voice of the old man forty-ish maybe who shook my hand one night in the cold and then walked with me back to my house that tone like an old cornet— i ’ ll never forget it not even in death he said nothing of wine but spoke to me then because i had suffered and was smoking a pipe “ and pipe smokers ” he declared shaking a little “ can always be trusted ” i nodded my head i came back to find the girls friendlier healthier their skirts cut higher—this after months of hunger— and i went and got married because i was drunk on all their freshness—a senile love i married the sassiest most muscular girl so i ’ d taste life again so i wouldn ’ t die behind a desk in an office surrounded by strangers but nella too was a stranger to me and a student pilot saw her with me once and later laid hands on her he ’ s dead now that coward—that poor kid— spun out of the sky—i guess i ’ m the coward now she ’ s got her baby—who knows if he ’ s mine— and she ’ s home all the time and i ’ m just a stranger who can ’ t keep her happy i don ’ t dare say a word and neither does nella she just looks at me it was beautiful how he cried as he told it the way a drunk cries his whole body to it and he hung on my shoulder saying between us always respect and there i was shaking with cold wanting to leave and helping him walk sipping grappa is nice but there ’ s also a pleasure in listening to the venting of an impotent old man who ’ s back from the front and asks your forgiveness what satisfaction will i ever have in this life i ’ m telling it straight i work at lucento what satisfaction will i ever have in this life
the hard thing ’ s to sit without being noticed everything else will come easy three sips and the impulse returns to sit thinking alone against the buzzing backdrop of noise everything fades and it ’ s suddenly a miracle to be born and to stare at the glass and work a man who ’ s alone can ’ t not think of work becomes again the old fate that suffering ’ s good for focusing thought and soon the eyes fix on nothing particular grieved as if blind if this man gets up and goes home to sleep he ’ ll look like a blind man that ’ s lost anyone could jump out of nowhere to brutally beat him a woman—beautiful young—might appear and lie under a man in the street and moan the way a woman once moaned under him but this man doesn ’ t see he heads home to sleep and life becomes nothing but the buzzing of silence undressing this man you ’ d find a body that ’ s wasted and here and there patches of fur who ’ d think to look at this man that life once burned in his lukewarm veins no one would guess that there was a woman once who gently touched that body who kissed that body which shakes and wet it with tears now that the man having come home to sleep can ’ t sleep only moan
february 1954 your nurse could only speak italian but after twenty minutes i could imagine your final week and tears ran down my cheeks ... when i embarked from italy with my mother ’ s body the whole shoreline of the golfo di genova was breaking into fiery flower the crazy yellow and azure sea-sleds blasting like jack-hammers across the spumante-bubbling wake of our liner recalled the clashing colors of my ford mother traveled first-class in the hold her risorgimento black and gold casket was like napoleon ’ s at the invalides ... while the passengers were tanning on the mediterranean in deck-chairs our family cemetery in dunbarton lay under the white mountains in the sub-zero weather the graveyard ’ s soil was changing to stone— so many of its deaths had been midwinter dour and dark against the blinding snowdrifts its black brook and fir trunks were as smooth as masts a fence of iron spear-hafts black-bordered its mostly colonial grave-slates the only “ unhistoric ” soul to come here was father now buried beneath his recent unweathered pink-veined slice of marble even the latin of his lowell motto occasionem cognosce seemed too businesslike and pushing here where the burning cold illuminated the hewn inscriptions of mother ’ s relatives twenty or thirty winslows and starks frost had given their names a diamond edge ... in the grandiloquent lettering on mother ’ s coffin lowell had been misspelled lovel the corpse was wrapped like panettone in italian tinfoil
alexandria 1956 the rugs had been rolled up and islands of them floated in the centers of every room and now on the bare wood floors my sister and i were skimming among them in the boats we ’ d made from newspaper sheets of them pinned to each other dhows gondolas clippers arks there was a mule outside on the street braying under a load of figs though mostly there was quiet a wind from the desert was putting the city to sleep but we were too far adrift the air was scurfy and wet the currents tricking our bows against reef and coral and hulls shearing under the weight of cargo “ ahoy and belay ” i called to my sister “ avast avast ” she yelled back from her rigging and neither of us knew what we were saying but the words came to us as from a movie cinemascopic american “ richard widmark ” i said “ clark gable bogie ” she said “ yo-ho-ho. ” we had passed cyprus and now there was crete or sardinia maybe something larger further off the horizon was everywhere i turned the waters were becoming turgid they were roiling weeks had passed “ america america land-ho ” i yelled directionless “ gibraltar ” my sister said “ heave to ” and signalling a right her arm straight out she turned and bravely set our course north-by-northwest for the new world did we arrive years later yes by plane suddenly with suitcases and something as hazy as a future the november sun was pale and far off the air was colder than we ’ d ever felt and already these were wonders to us as much as snow would be or evergreens and it would take me a long time before i ’ d ever remember boats made of paper islands of wool and my sister ’ s voice as in a fog calling out the hazards leading me on getting us there
there in that lost corner of the ordnance survey drive through the vanity — two pubs and a garage — of satley then right cross the a68 past down-at-heel farms and a quarry you ca n't miss it a 't instead of a 'plus' where the road meets a wall if it 's a usual day there 'll be freezing wind and you'll stumble climbing the stile a ladder really as you pull your hat down and zip up your jacket out on the moor thin air may be strong enough to knock you over but if you head into it downhill you can shelter in the wide cindery trench of an old leadmine-to-consett railway you may have to share it with a crowd of dirty supercilious-looking ewes who will baaa and cut jerkily away after posting you blank stares from their foreign eyes one winter we came across five steaming icicle-hung cows but in summer when the heather 's full of nests you 'll hear curlews following you raking your memory maybe with their cries or right under you nose a grouse will whirr up surprised like a poet startled by a line when it comes to her sideways no protection is offered by trees — hawthorn the english call may a few struggling birches but of wagtails and yellowhammers plenty and peewits who never say peewit more a minor go'way go'way who was he salter why was this his gate a pedlars way they carried salt to meat the place gives tang to survival its unstoppable view a reservoir ruins of the lead mines new forestry pushing from the right the curlew
for tony i could not disengage my world from the rest of humanity wind chill factor 11° below all night wind thrashes barechested trees like a west texas tent evangelist hissing them on his knees lisping sinnn sinn sinn all night wind preaches old tool shed behind my house fist-cuffs itself to nail-loose tin horse pasture gates clank their crimes while neighing black stallions of rain stampede on the patio fleeing gunshots of thunder miles south of here nightscopes pick up human heat that green fuzz helicopter dash panels a mother whispers “ sssshhhh mejito nomás poco más allá nomás poco más allá. ” dunes of playing-dead people jack rabbit under strobe lights and cutting whack/blades “ ssshhh mejito sssshhhh. ” child whimpers and staggers in blinding dust and gnashing wind those not caught scratch sand up to sleep against underbellies of roots and stones eventually juanito comes to my door sick from eating stucco chips— his meals scratched off walls of temporary shelters and enrique who guzzled water at industrial pipes pouring green foam out at the el paso/juarez border and maria steaming with fever face dark meteorite whispers “ where i come from señor baca a woman ’ s womb is a rock and children born from me drop like stones to become dust under death squad ’ s boots. ” and juanito “ they came at midnight and took my brothers i have never seen them since each judge ’ s tongue is a bleeding stub of death and each lawyer ’ s finger a soft coffin nail. ” and enrique “ you can trust no one each crying person ’ s eye is a damp cellar where thieves and murderers sleep. ” they have found refuge here at black mesa the sun passes between our lives as between two trees one gray one green but side by side
our ropes are the roots of our life we fish low in the earth the river beneath runs through our veins blue and cold in a riverbed when the sun comes up the moon moves slowly to the left i tie the logs and limbs together holding them in place the ocean beats them smooth like rock here my sense of time is flat i find in a strip of damp sand footprints and marks of hands and torn pieces of flesh night is a beast the tide moves gushing back and forth sunlight touches our faces turning us turning us turning us in our morning sleep 1976
i go separately the sweet knees of oxen have pressed a path for me ghosts with ingots have burned their bare hands it is the dungaree darkness with china stitched where the westerly winds and the traveler ’ s checks the evensong of salesmen the glistening paraphernalia of twin suitcases where no one speaks english i go separately it is the wind the rubber wind when we brush our teeth in the way station a climate to beard what forks these roads who clammers o ’ er the twain what murmurs and rustles in the distance in the white branches where the light is whipped piercing at the crossing as into the dunes we simmer and toss ourselves awhile the motor pants like a forest where owls from their bandaged eyes send messages to the indian couple peaks have you heard i go separately we have reached the arithmetics are partially quenched while it growls and hints in the lost trapper ’ s voice she is coming toward us like a session of pines in the wild wooden air where rabbits are frozen o mother of lakes and glaciers save us gamblers whose wagon is perilously rapt

1 adios carenage in idle august while the sea soft and leaves of brown islands stick to the rim of this caribbean i blow out the light by the dreamless face of maria concepcion to ship as a seaman on the schooner flight out in the yard turning gray in the dawn i stood like a stone and nothing else move but the cold sea rippling like galvanize and the nail holes of stars in the sky roof till a wind start to interfere with the trees i pass me dry neighbor sweeping she yard as i went downhill and i nearly said “ sweep soft you witch ’ cause she don ’ t sleep hard ” but the bitch look through me like i was dead a route taxi pull up park-lights still on the driver size up my bags with a grin “ this time shabine like you really gone ” i ain ’ t answer the ass i simply pile in the back seat and watch the sky burn above laventille pink as the gown in which the woman i left was sleeping and i look in the rearview and see a man exactly like me and the man was weeping for the houses the streets that whole fucking island christ have mercy on all sleeping things from that dog rotting down wrightson road to when i was a dog on these streets if loving these islands must be my load out of corruption my soul takes wings but they had started to poison my soul with their big house big car big-time bohbohl coolie nigger syrian and french creole so i leave it for them and their carnival— i taking a sea bath i gone down the road i know these islands from monos to nassau a rusty head sailor with sea-green eyes that they nickname shabine the patois for any red nigger and i shabine saw when these slums of empire was paradise i ’ m just a red nigger who love the sea i had a sound colonial education i have dutch nigger and english in me and either i ’ m nobody or i ’ m a nation but maria concepcion was all my thought watching the sea heaving up and down as the port side of dories schooners and yachts was painted afresh by the strokes of the sun signing her name with every reflection i knew when dark-haired evening put on her bright silk at sunset and folding the sea sidled under the sheet with her starry laugh that there ’ d be no rest there ’ d be no forgetting is like telling mourners round the graveside about resurrection they want the dead back so i smile to myself as the bow rope untied and the flight swing seaward “ is no use repeating that the sea have more fish i ain ’ t want her dressed in the sexless light of a seraph i want those round brown eyes like a marmoset and till the day when i can lean back and laugh those claws that tickled my back on sweating sunday afternoons like a crab on wet sand. ” as i worked watching the rotting waves come past the bow that scissor the sea like silk i swear to you all by my mother ’ s milk by the stars that shall fly from tonight ’ s furnace that i loved them my children my wife my home i loved them as poets love the poetry that kills them as drowned sailors the sea you ever look up from some lonely beach and see a far schooner well when i write this poem each phrase go be soaked in salt i go draw and knot every line as tight as ropes in this rigging in simple speech my common language go be the wind my pages the sails of the schooner flight but let me tell you how this business begin 2 raptures of the deep smuggled scotch for o ’ hara big government man between cedros and the main so the coast guard couldn ’ t touch us and the spanish pirogues always met us halfway but a voice kept saying “ shabine see this business of playing pirate ” well so said so done that whole racket crash and i for a woman for her laces and silks maria concepcion ay ay next thing i hear some commission of inquiry was being organized to conduct a big quiz with himself as chairman investigating himself well i knew damn well who the suckers would be not that shark in shark skin but his pilot fish khaki-pants red niggers like you and me what worse i fighting with maria concepcion plates flying and thing so i swear “ not again ” it was mashing up my house and my family i was so broke all i needed was shades and a cup or four shades and four cups in four-cup port of spain all the silver i had was the coins on the sea you saw them ministers in the express guardians of the poor—one hand at their back and one set o ’ police only guarding their house and the scotch pouring in through the back door as for that minister-monster who smuggled the booze that half-syrian saurian i got so vex to see that face thick with powder the warts the stone lids like a dinosaur caked with primordial ooze by the lightning of flashbulbs sinking in wealth that i said “ shabine this is shit understand ” but he get somebody to kick my crutch out his office like i was some artist that bitch was so grand couldn ’ t get off his high horse and kick me himself i have seen things that would make a slave sick in this trinidad the limers ’ republic i couldn ’ t shake the sea noise out of my head the shell of my ears sang maria concepcion so i start salvage diving with a crazy mick name o ’ shaugnessy and a limey named head but this caribbean so choke with the dead that when i would melt in emerald water whose ceiling rippled like a silk tent i saw them corals brain fire sea fans dead-men ’ s-fingers and then the dead men i saw that the powdery sand was their bones ground white from senegal to san salvador so i panic third dive and surface for a month in the seamen ’ s hostel fish broth and sermons when i thought of the woe i had brought my wife when i saw my worries with that other woman i wept under water salt seeking salt for her beauty had fallen on me like a sword cleaving me from my children flesh of my flesh there was this barge from st. vincent but she was too deep to float her again when we drank the limey got tired of my sobbing for maria concepcion he said he was getting the bends good for him the pain in my heart for maria concepcion the hurt i had done to my wife and children was worse than the bends in the rapturous deep there was no cleft rock where my soul could hide like the boobies each sunset no sandbar of light where i could rest like the pelicans know so i got raptures once and i saw god like a harpooned grouper bleeding and a far voice was rumbling “ shabine if you leave her if you leave her i shall give you the morning star. ” when i left the madhouse i tried other women but once they stripped naked their spiky cunts bristled like sea eggs and i couldn ’ t dive the chaplain came round i paid him no mind where is my rest place jesus where is my harbor where is the pillow i will not have to pay for and the window i can look from that frames my life 3 shabine leaves the republic i had no nation now but the imagination after the white man the niggers didn ’ t want me when the power swing to their side the first chain my hands and apologize “ history ” the next said i wasn ’ t black enough for their pride tell me what power on these unknown rocks— a spray-plane air force the fire brigade the red cross the regiment two three police dogs that pass before you finish bawling “ parade ” i met history once but he ain ’ t recognize me a parchment creole with warts like an old sea bottle crawling like a crab through the holes of shadow cast by the net of a grille balcony cream linen cream hat i confront him and shout “ sir is shabine they say i ’ se your grandson you remember grandma your black cook at all ” the bitch hawk and spat a spit like that worth any number of words but that ’ s all them bastards have left us words i no longer believed in the revolution i was losing faith in the love of my woman i had seen that moment aleksandr blok crystallize in the twelve was between the police marine branch and hotel venezuelana one sunday at noon young men without flags using shirts their chests waiting for holes they kept marching into the mountains and their noise ceased as foam sinks into sand they sank in the bright hills like rain every one with his own nimbus leaving shirts in the street and the echo of power at the end of the street propeller-blade fans turn over the senate the judges they say still sweat in carmine on frederick street the idlers all marching by standing still the budget turns a new leaf in the 12:30 movies the projectors best not break down or you go see revolution aleksandr blok enters and sits in the third row of pit eating choc- olate cone waiting for a spaghetti west- ern with clint eastwood and featuring lee van cleef 4 the flight passing blanchisseuse dusk the flight passing blanchisseuse gulls wheel like from a gun again and foam gone amber that was white lighthouse and star start making friends down every beach the long day ends and there on that last stretch of sand on a beach bare of all but light dark hands start pulling in the seine of the dark sea deep deep inland 5 shabine encounters the middle passage man i brisk in the galley first thing next dawn brewing li ’ l coffee fog coil from the sea like the kettle steaming when i put it down slow slow ’ cause i couldn ’ t believe what i see where the horizon was one silver haze the fog swirl and swell into sails so close that i saw it was sails my hair grip my skull it was horrors but it was beautiful we float through a rustling forest of ships with sails dry like paper behind the glass i saw men with rusty eyeholes like cannons and whenever their half-naked crews cross the sun right through their tissue you traced their bones like leaves against the sunlight frigates barkentines the backward-moving current swept them on and high on their decks i saw great admirals rodney nelson de grasse i heard the hoarse orders they gave those shabines and that forest of masts sail right through the flight and all you could hear was the ghostly sound of waves rustling like grass in a low wind and the hissing weeds they trailed from the stern slowly they heaved past from east to west like this round world was some cranked water wheel every ship pouring like a wooden bucket dredged from the deep my memory revolve on all sailors before me then the sun heat the horizon ’ s ring and they was mist next we pass slave ships flags of all nations our fathers below deck too deep i suppose to hear us shouting so we stop shouting who knows who his grandfather is much less his name tomorrow our landfall will be the barbados 6 the sailor sings back to the casuarinas you see them on the low hills of barbados bracing like windbreaks needles for hurricanes trailing like masts the cirrus of torn sails when i was green like them i used to think those cypresses leaning against the sea that take the sea noise up into their branches are not real cypresses but casuarinas now captain just call them canadian cedars but cedars cypresses or casuarinas whoever called them so had a good cause watching their bending bodies wail like women after a storm when some schooner came home with news of one more sailor drowned again once the sound “ cypress ” used to make more sense than the green “ casuarinas ” though to the wind whatever grief bent them was all the same since they were trees with nothing else in mind but heavenly leaping or to guard a grave but we live like our names and you would have to be colonial to know the difference to know the pain of history words contain to love those trees with an inferior love and to believe “ those casuarinas bend like cypresses their hair hangs down in rain like sailors ’ wives they ’ re classic trees and we if we live like the names our masters please by careful mimicry might become men. ” 7 the flight anchors in castries harbor when the stars self were young over castries i loved you alone and i loved the whole world what does it matter that our lives are different burdened with the loves of our different children when i think of your young face washed by the wind and your voice that chuckles in the slap of the sea the lights are out on la toc promontory except for the hospital across at vigie the marina arcs keep vigil i have kept my own promise to leave you the one thing i own you whom i loved first my poetry we here for one night tomorrow the flight will be gone 8 fight with the crew it had one bitch on board like he had me mark— that was the cook some vincentian arse with a skin like a gommier tree red peeling bark and wash-out blue eyes he wouldn ’ t give me a ease like he feel he was white had an exercise book this same one here that i was using to write my poetry so one day this man snatch it from my hand and start throwing it left and right to the rest of the crew bawling out “ catch it ” and start mincing me like i was some hen because of the poems some case is for fist some case is for tholing pin some is for knife— this one was for knife well i beg him first but he keep reading “ o my children my wife ” and playing he crying to make the crew laugh it move like a flying fish the silver knife that catch him right in the plump of his calf and he faint so slowly and he turn more white than he thought he was i suppose among men you need that sort of thing it ain ’ t right but that ’ s how it is there wasn ’ t much pain just plenty blood and vincie and me best friend but none of them go fuck with my poetry again 9 maria concepcion the book of dreams the jet that was screeching over the flight was opening a curtain into the past “ dominica ahead ” “ it still have caribs there. ” “ one day go be planes only no more boat. ” “ vince god ain ’ t make nigger to fly through the air. ” “ progress shabine that ’ s what it ’ s all about progress leaving all we small islands behind. ” i was at the wheel vince sitting next to me gaffing crisp bracing day a high-running sea ” progress is something to ask caribs about they kill them by millions some in war some by forced labor dying in the mines looking for silver after that niggers more progress until i see definite signs that mankind change vince i ain ’ t want to hear progress is history ’ s dirty joke ask that sad green island getting nearer. ” green islands like mangoes pickled in brine in such fierce salt let my wound be healed me in my freshness as a seafarer that night with the sky sparks frosty with fire i ran like a carib through dominica my nose holes choked with memory of smoke i heard the screams of my burning children i ate the brains of mushrooms the fungi of devil ’ s parasols under white leprous rocks my breakfast was leaf mold in leaking forests with leaves big as maps and when i heard noise of the soldiers ’ progress through the thick leaves though my heart was bursting i get up and ran through the blades of balisier sharper than spears with the blood of my race i ran boy i ran with moss-footed speed like a painted bird then i fall but i fall by an icy stream under cool fountains of fern and a screaming parrot catch the dry branches and i drowned at last in big breakers of smoke then when that ocean of black smoke pass and the sky turn white there was nothing but progress if progress is an iguana as still as a young leaf in sunlight i bawl for maria and her book of dreams it anchored her sleep that insomniac ’ s bible a soiled orange booklet with a cyclop ’ s eye center from the dominican republic its coarse pages were black with the usual symbols of prophecy in excited spanish an open palm upright sectioned and numbered like a butcher chart delivered the future one night in a fever radiantly ill she say “ bring me the book the end has come. ” she said “ i dreamt of whales and a storm ” but for that dream the book had no answer a next night i dreamed of three old women featureless as silkworms stitching my fate and i scream at them to come out my house and i try beating them away with a broom but as they go out so they crawl back again until i start screaming and crying my flesh raining with sweat and she ravage the book for the dream meaning and there was nothing my nerves melt like a jellyfish—that was when i broke— they found me round the savannah screaming all you see me talking to the wind so you think i mad well shabine has bridled the horses of the sea you see me watching the sun till my eyeballs seared so all you mad people feel shabine crazy but all you ain ’ t know my strength hear the coconuts standing by in their regiments in yellow khaki they waiting for shabine to take over these islands and all you best dread the day i am healed of being a human all you fate in my hand ministers businessmen shabine have you friend i shall scatter your lives like a handful of sand i who have no weapon but poetry and the lances of palms and the sea ’ s shining shield 10 out of the depths next day dark sea a arse-aching dawn “ damn wind shift sudden as a woman mind. ” the slow swell start cresting like some mountain range with snow on the top “ ay skipper sky dark ” “ this ain ’ t right for august. ” “ this light damn strange this season sky should be clear as a field. ” a stingray steeplechase across the sea tail whipping water the high man-o ’ -wars start reeling inland quick quick an archery of flying fish miss us vince say “ you notice ” and a black-mane squall pounce on the sail like a dog on a pigeon and it snap the neck of the flight and shake it from head to tail “ be jesus i never see sea get so rough so fast that wind come from god back pocket ” “ where cap ’ n headin like the man gone blind ” “ if we ’ s to drong we go drong vince fock-it ” “ shabine say your prayers if life leave you any ” i have not loved those that i loved enough worse than the mule kick of kick- ’ em-jenny channel rain start to pelt the flight between mountains of water if i was frighten the tent poles of water spouts bracing the sky start wobbling clouds unstitch at the seams and sky water drench us and i hear myself cry “ i ’ m the drowned sailor in her book of dreams. ” i remembered them ghost ships i saw me corkscrewing to the sea bed of sea worms fathom pass fathom my jaw clench like a fist and only one thing hold me trembling how my family safe home then a strength like it seize me and the strength said “ i from backward people who still fear god. ” let him in his might heave leviathan upward by the winch of his will the beast pouring lace from his sea-bottom bed and that was the faith that had fade from a child in the methodist chapel in chisel street castries when the whale-bell sang service and in hard pews ribbed like the whale proud with despair we sang how our race survive the sea ’ s maw our history our peril and now i was ready for whatever death will but if that storm had strength was in cap ’ n face beard beading with spray tears salting his eyes crucify to his post that nigger hold fast to that wheel man like the cross held jesus and the wounds of his eyes like they crying for us and i feeding him white rum while every crest with leviathan-lash make the flight quail like two criminal whole night with no rest till red-eyed like dawn we watch our travail subsiding subside and there was no more storm and the noon sea get calm as thy kingdom come 11 after the storm there ’ s a fresh light that follows a storm while the whole sea still havoc in its bright wake i saw the veiled face of maria concepcion marrying the ocean then drifting away in the widening lace of her bridal train with white gulls her bridesmaids till she was gone i wanted nothing after that day across my own face like the face of the sun a light rain was falling with the sea calm fall gently rain on the sea ’ s upturned face like a girl showering make these islands fresh as shabine once knew them let every trace every hot road smell like clothes she just press and sprinkle with drizzle i finish dream whatever the rain wash and the sun iron the white clouds the sea and sky with one seam is clothes enough for my nakedness though my flight never pass the incoming tide of this inland sea beyond the loud reefs of the final bahamas i am satisfied if my hand gave voice to one people ’ s grief open the map more islands there man than peas on a tin plate all different size one thousand in the bahamas alone from mountains to low scrub with coral keys and from this bowsprit i bless every town the blue smell of smoke in hills behind them and the one small road winding down them like twine to the roofs below i have only one theme the bowsprit the arrow the longing the lunging heart— the flight to a target whose aim we ’ ll never know vain search for one island that heals with its harbor and a guiltless horizon where the almond ’ s shadow doesn ’ t injure the sand there are so many islands as many islands as the stars at night on that branched tree from which meteors are shaken like falling fruit around the schooner flight but things must fall and so it always was on one hand venus on the other mars fall and are one just as this earth is one island in archipelagoes of stars my first friend was the sea now is my last i stop talking now i work then i read cotching under a lantern hooked to the mast i try to forget what happiness was and when that don ’ t work i study the stars sometimes is just me and the soft-scissored foam as the deck turn white and the moon open a cloud like a door and the light over me is a road in white moonlight taking me home shabine sang to you from the depths of the sea
rose harsh rose marred and with stint of petals meagre flower thin sparse of leaf more precious than a wet rose single on a stem— you are caught in the drift stunted with small leaf you are flung on the sand you are lifted in the crisp sand that drives in the wind can the spice-rose drip such acrid fragrance hardened in a leaf
poetry it ’ s a hobby i run model trains mr shaw there breeds pigeons it ’ s not work you dont sweat nobody pays for it you could advertise soap art that ’ s opera or repertory— the desert song nancy was in the chorus but to ask for twelve pounds a week— married aren ’ t you — you ’ ve got a nerve how could i look a bus conductor in the face if i paid you twelve pounds who says it ’ s poetry anyhow my ten year old can do it and rhyme i get three thousand and expenses a car vouchers but i ’ m an accountant they do what i tell them my company what do you do nasty little words nasty long words it ’ s unhealthy i want to wash when i meet a poet they ’ re reds addicts all delinquents what you write is rot mr hines says so and he ’ s a schoolteacher he ought to know go and find work
i was ill lying on my bed of old papers when you came with white rabbits in your arms and the doves scattered upwards flying to mothers and the snails sighed under their baggage of stone now your tongue grows like celery between us because of our love-cries cabbage darkens in its nest the cauliflower thinks of her pale plump children and turns greenish-white in a light like the ocean ’ s i was sick fainting in the smell of teabags when you came with tomatoes a good poetry i am being wooed i am being conquered by a cliff of limestone that leaves chalk on my breasts
when you ’ re up against a trouble meet it squarely face to face lift your chin and set your shoulders plant your feet and take a brace when it ’ s vain to try to dodge it do the best that you can do you may fail but you may conquer see it through black may be the clouds about you and your future may seem grim but don ’ t let your nerve desert you keep yourself in fighting trim if the worst is bound to happen spite of all that you can do running from it will not save you see it through even hope may seem but futile when with troubles you ’ re beset but remember you are facing just what other men have met you may fail but fall still fighting don ’ t give up whate ’ er you do eyes front head high to the finish see it through
for harvey shapiro i stand and listen head bowed to my inner complaint persons passing by think i am searching for a lost coin you ’ re fired i yell inside after an especially bad episode i ’ m letting you go without notice or terminal pay you just lost another chance to make good but then i watch myself standing at the exit depressed and about to leave and wave myself back in wearily for who else could i get in my place to do the job in dark airless conditions

yellow jacket nest i stomped on it i took it to the palm reader i said “ sister read this ” a lot of evenings i listened for them i knew they would come back when a stranger got a drink at night i thought it was the holy ghost and sometimes a cloud went by like a three-legged dog and the thunder was someone with a shotgun letting him have it now the moon was a fifty-cent piece it was a belly i wanted to cut open when the flies got bad i kept the hand in the smokehouse v swimming at night the midget ran his finger across his neck the other one said “ give it back ” i waited in the outhouse i had a sawed-off shotgun the men rode off in the afternoon they sold fish they cleaned them at the pump the scales dried up on their faces they loaded the meat on stolen horses at night they rode up shooting pistols i slept with an ice pick under my pillow one night they rode up drunk the midget was sitting in the guitar player ’ s lap he said “ come on out ” they tied a bale of hay to baby gauge

mouth i came up near the guitar player ’ s boat he was running the lines i swam to the other end of the trot line i put the hand on a hook i jerked the lines like a big fish the guitar player worked his way down he thought he had a good one i let go of the line he saw his left hand he screamed he fell out of the boat i swam back through the river i buried the knife in the levee i was sleeping in the negro ’ s lap he was spitting snuff on my wounds born in the camp with six toes cut me with a knife baby gauge sucked the poison out oh sweet jesus the levees that break in my heart
today we woke up to a revolution of snow its white flag waving over everything the landscape vanished not a single mouse to punctuate the blankness and beyond these windows the government buildings smothered schools and libraries buried the post office lost under the noiseless drift the paths of trains softly blocked the world fallen under this falling in a while i will put on some boots and step out like someone walking in water and the dog will porpoise through the drifts and i will shake a laden branch sending a cold shower down on us both but for now i am a willing prisoner in this house a sympathizer with the anarchic cause of snow i will make a pot of tea and listen to the plastic radio on the counter as glad as anyone to hear the news that the kiddie corner school is closed the ding-dong school closed the all aboard children ’ s school closed the hi-ho nursery school closed along with—some will be delighted to hear— the toadstool school the little school little sparrows nursery school little stars pre-school peas-and-carrots day school the tom thumb child center all closed and—clap your hands—the peanuts play school so this is where the children hide all day these are the nests where they letter and draw where they put on their bright miniature jackets all darting and climbing and sliding all but the few girls whispering by the fence and now i am listening hard in the grandiose silence of the snow trying to hear what those three girls are plotting what riot is afoot which small queen is about to be brought down
for laure-anne bosselaar and kurt brown 1. retreat the sailor dreamt of loss but it was i who dreamt the sailor i was landlocked sea-poor the sailor dreamt of a woman who stared at the sea then tired of it advertised her freedom she said to her friend i want all the fire one can have without being consumed by it clearly i dreamt the woman too i was surrounded by mountains suddenly green after a long winter a chosen uprootedness soul shake-up every day a lesson about the vastness between ecstasy and repose i drank coffee called black forest at the local cafe i took long walks and tried to love the earth and hate its desecrations all the golden retrievers wore red bandannas on those muttless streets all the birches i think were aspens i do not often remember my dreams or dream of dreamers in them to be without some of the things you want a wise man said is an indispensable part of happiness 2. mountain sky i ’ ve been paying attention to the sky again i ’ ve seen a ravine up there and a narrow black gorge not to worry i tell myself about tricks the mind plays as long as you know they ’ re tricks if the rich are casually cruel perhaps it ’ s because they can stare at the sky and never see an indictment in the shape of clouds the frown for example in a thunderhead the fist that big mountain i ’ ve been looking at— i love how it borrows purple from the filtered light sometimes red like any of us it ’ s all of its appearances it ’ s good that the rich have to die a peasant saying goes otherwise they ’ d live forever here in this rented house high up i understand i ’ m one of the rich for a while the earth feels mine and the air i breathe is rarefied if thin dusk now is making its last claim i love the confluence of dark mountain dark sky soon i won ’ t know the beginning from the end 3. him those empty celebrations of the half-believer along for the ride those secret words repeated in mirrors— someone ’ s personal fog a man ’ s heart ransomed for comfort or a few extra bucks his soul in rags i have been him and him and him was it nobility or senility when my old grandmother tried to drown artificial flowers in the bathtub can only saints carry the load without talking about the burden i want to lean into life catch the faintest perfume in every boy child an old man is dying by middle age he begins to stink complain i want to have gifts for him when we finally meet i want him to go out like an ancient egyptian surrounded by what is his desiring nothing 4. delineation at dusk a lost hour and that animal lassitude after a vanished afternoon outside

she ’ s beautiful it ’ s beautiful someone does the sky ’ s murmuring the storm that calls you up makes promises never comes somewhere else no doubt a happy man slicing a tomato a woman with a measuring cup somewhere else the foreclosure of a feeling or a promise followed by silence or shouts here the slow dance of contingency an afternoon connected to an evening by a slender wish sometimes absence makes the heart grow sluggish and desire only one person or one thing i am closing the curtains i am helping the night 5. solitude a few days ago i stopped looking at the photographs clustered on the wall nudes which had become dull to me like a tourist ’ s collection of smooth rocks i turned away from the view and conjured a plague of starlings oh how they darkened the landscape surely such beauty had been waiting for its elegy i felt like crushing a rhododendron now and again i feel the astonishment of being alive like this in this body the ventricles and the small bones in the hand the intricacies of digestion ... when the radio said parents in california gave birth to another child so that their older child might have a bone-marrow transplant and live i found myself weeping for such complicated beauty how wonderful the radio and its distant human voices the rain now is quite without consequence coming down i suppose i ’ ve come to the limits of my paltry resources this hankering for people and for massive disturbance then high pressure the sequence that ’ s been promised for days i will long to be alone when my friends arrive 6. the body widens the body widens and people are welcomed into it many at a time this must be what happens when we learn to be generous when we ’ re not in love or otherwise charmed i ’ ve been examining yesterday ’ s ashes i ’ ve visited my own candleless altar little by little the old selfish parts of me are loosening i have a plan for becoming lean to use all my fat in service of expansion have women always known this loveliness and fear when they open and let in and give away the mountains here pierce the sky and the sky bountiful closes in around them 7. a new mouth give me a new mouth i want to talk i ’ ve been watching the spider mend its web i think i ’ ve learned something about architecture from a swallow excuse me while i separate the nettles from the flowers while i put my nose to the black moist smell of earth and come up smiling somewhere in the world is the secret name for god many-lettered unpronounceable there ’ s a speakable grace in the fields and even in the cities the grapes ripen someone refuses to become a machine and yet i want to talk about the worn-out husks of men and women returning from the factories the venereal streets the bruise history passes down to its forlorn children i need a new mouth to acknowledge that piety will keep us small imprisoned that it ’ s all right to be ridiculous and sway first to the left then to the right in order to find our balance i ’ ve been watching an evening star quiver i ’ ve been trying to identify the word before its utterance give me a new mouth and i ’ ll be a guardian against forgetfulness i ’ ve noticed the wind doesn ’ t discriminate between sycamore and cypress i want to find the cool precise language for how passion gives rise to passion 8. stranger the wind gone i can hear my breathing i can hear the lateness of the hour by what isn ’ t moving woodrun slope snowmass village these are winter names and it ’ s summer the water from the mountains rushes down man-made gullies serious phantoms with

fabulous strangers who appear and disappear now i arrive only by invitation stay long enough to earn my fare outside my window clouds from the west erasing the stars a coyote howling its singular news

so they stood upon ladders with pruning hooks backs to the king who took his leave of gardening this morning i am forlorn as he was then no one born after the war remembers when
for once i felt wanted dead or alive the day my fame outgrew the famous five there came a time i could give no more to the other guys in the gang of four and i felt the dead weight fall from me when i unyoked the clowns of the crucial three i considered all this as i boarded the bus to quit the town not big enough for both of us one eye didn ’ t seem so much to leave behind as i sped to my job in the kingdom of the blind
1 afoot and light-hearted i take to the open road healthy free the world before me the long brown path before me leading wherever i choose henceforth i ask not good-fortune i myself am good-fortune henceforth i whimper no more postpone no more need nothing done with indoor complaints libraries querulous criticisms strong and content i travel the open road the earth that is sufficient i do not want the constellations any nearer i know they are very well where they are i know they suffice for those who belong to them still here i carry my old delicious burdens i carry them men and women i carry them with me wherever i go i swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them i am fill ’ d with them and i will fill them in return 2 you road i enter upon and look around i believe you are not all that is here i believe that much unseen is also here here the profound lesson of reception nor preference nor denial the black with his woolly head the felon the diseas ’ d the illiterate person are not denied the birth the hasting after the physician the beggar ’ s tramp the drunkard ’ s stagger the laughing party of mechanics the escaped youth the rich person ’ s carriage the fop the eloping couple the early market-man the hearse the moving of furniture into the town the return back from the town they pass i also pass any thing passes none can be interdicted none but are accepted none but shall be dear to me 3 you air that serves me with breath to speak you objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape you light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers you paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides i believe you are latent with unseen existences you are so dear to me you flagg ’ d walks of the cities you strong curbs at the edges you ferries you planks and posts of wharves you timber-lined sides you distant ships you rows of houses you window-pierc ’ d façades you roofs you porches and entrances you copings and iron guards you windows whose transparent shells might expose so much you doors and ascending steps you arches you gray stones of interminable pavements you trodden crossings from all that has touch ’ d you i believe you have imparted to yourselves and now would impart the same secretly to me from the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me 4 the earth expanding right hand and left hand the picture alive every part in its best light the music falling in where it is wanted and stopping where it is not wanted

already prepared i am well-beaten and undenied adhere to me o public road i say back i am not afraid to leave you yet i love you you express me better than i can express myself you shall be more to me than my poem i think heroic deeds were all conceiv ’ d in the open air and all free poems also i think i could stop here myself and do miracles i think whatever i shall meet on the road i shall like and whoever beholds me shall like me i think whoever i see must be happy 5 from this hour i ordain myself loos ’ d of limits and imaginary lines going where i list my own master total and absolute listening to others considering well what they say pausing searching receiving contemplating gently but with undeniable will divesting myself of the holds that would hold me i inhale great draughts of space the east and the west are mine and the north and the south are mine i am larger better than i thought i did not know i held so much goodness all seems beautiful to me i can repeat over to men and women you have done such good to me i would do the same to you i will recruit for myself and you as i go i will scatter myself among men and women as i go i will toss a new gladness and roughness among them whoever denies me it shall not trouble me whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me 6 now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear ’ d it would not astonish me now i see the secret of the making of the best persons it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth here a great personal deed has room such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it here is the test of wisdom wisdom is not finally tested in schools wisdom can not be pass ’ d from one having it to another not having it wisdom is of the soul is not susceptible of proof is its own proof applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things and the excellence of things something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul now i re-examine philosophies and religions they may prove well in lecture-rooms yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents here is realization here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in him the past the future majesty love—if they are vacant of you you are vacant of them only the kernel of every object nourishes where is he who tears off the husks for you and me where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me here is adhesiveness it is not previously fashion ’ d it is apropos do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls 7 here is the efflux of the soul the efflux of the soul comes from within through embower ’ d gates ever provoking questions these yearnings why are they these thoughts in the darkness why are they why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me i think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as i pass what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side what with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as i walk by and pause what gives me to be free to a woman ’ s and man ’ s good-will what gives them to be free to mine 8 the efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness i think it pervades the open air waiting at all times now it flows unto us we are rightly charged here rises the fluid and attaching character the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old from it falls distill ’ d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact 9 allons whoever

here i and mine do not convince by arguments similes rhymes we convince by our presence 11 listen i will be honest with you i do not offer the old smooth prizes but offer rough new prizes these are the days that must happen to you you shall not heap up what is call ’ d riches you shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve you but arrive at the city to which you were destin ’ d you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call ’ d by an irresistible call to depart you shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you what

the wind blew high the waters raved a ship drove on the land a hundred human creatures saved kneel ’ d down upon the sand three-score were drown ’ d three-score were thrown upon the black rocks wild and thus among them left alone they found one helpless child a seaman rough to shipwreck bred stood out from all the rest and gently laid the lonely head upon his honest breast and travelling o ’ er the desert wide it was a solemn joy to see them ever side by side the sailor and the boy in famine sickness hunger thirst the two were still but one until the strong man droop ’ d the first and felt his labours done then to a trusty friend he spake “ across the desert wide o take this poor boy for my sake ” and kiss ’ d the child and died toiling along in weary plight through heavy jungle mire these two came later every night to warm them at the fire until the captain said one day “ o seaman good and kind to save thyself now come away and leave the boy behind ” the child was slumbering near the blaze “ o captain let him rest until it sinks when god ’ s own ways shall teach us what is best ” they watch ’ d the whiten ’ d ashy heap they touch ’ d the child in vain they did not leave him there asleep he never woke again

in the bavarian steeple on the hour two figures emerge from their scalloped house carrying sledges that they clap in turn against the surface of the bell by legend they are summer and winter youth and age as though the forces of plenty and of loss played equally on the human soul extracted easily the same low bronze note spreading upward from the encumbrance of the village past alluvial fields to the pocked highland where cattle shift their massive heads at this dissonance this faint redundant pressure in the ears in the air from the village the mountain seems a single stone a single blank completion seeing the summit pierce the abstract heavens we reconstruct the valley on the mountain— a shepherd propped against his crook birds enthralled on a branch the branch feathering the edge of the canvas—transposing such forms as can extend the flawed earth and embody us intact unaltering among the soft surprising trees of childhood mimosa honey locust and willow wood in the midst of woods the village houses are allied in a formal shape beside a stream the streets concluding at the monument again the ravishing moment of the bell the townspeople curious or accustomed stop to count the strokes odd or even—the confectioner counting out the lavendar candies for his customer the butcher the greengrocer the surgeon and the constable—as the housewife stands on the stoop shaking her mop and sees the dust briefly veil the air an algebra of swirling particles

this is my advice to foreigners call it simply—the river never say old muddy or even missouri and except when it is necessary ignore the fact that it moves it is the river a singular stationary figure of division do not allow the pre-socratic to enter your mind except when thinking of clear water trout streams in north central wyoming the river is a variety of land a kind of dark sea or great bay sea of greater ocean at times i find it good discipline to think of it as a tree rooted in the delta a snake on its topmost western branch these hills are not containers they give no vantage but that looking out is an act of transit we are not confused we do not lose our place

what thoughts i have of you tonight walt whitman for i walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon in my hungry fatigue and shopping for images i went into the neon fruit supermarket dreaming of your enumerations what peaches and what penumbras whole families shopping at night aisles full of husbands wives in the avocados babies in the tomatoes —and you garcia lorca what were you doing down by the watermelons i saw you walt whitman childless lonely old grubber poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys i heard you asking questions of each who killed the pork chops what price bananas are you my angel i wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you and followed in my imagination by the store detective we strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes possessing every frozen delicacy and never passing the cashier where are we going walt whitman the doors close in an hour which way does your beard point tonight i touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd will we walk all night through solitary streets the trees add shade to shade lights out in the houses we 'll both be lonely will we stroll dreaming of the lost america of love past blue automobiles in driveways home to our silent cottage ah dear father graybeard lonely old courage-teacher what america did you have when charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of lethe berkeley 1955

the doctor is glimpsed among his mulberry trees the dark fruits disfigure the sward like contusions he is at once aloof timid intolerant of all banalities of village life and yet is stupefied by loneliness continually he dreams of the company he craves for but he challenges it and bores it to tears whenever it swims uncertainly into his narrow orbit meetings however relished in their prospect seem only to be arrangements for departures exemplum the spruce captain and his vampire wife with her token fur hat and veil like a bandage extemporised by a bat it seems that exercise keeps the captain ’ s horse in a permanent lather the wife suffers from a disabling ennui what more likely than a harmless liaison at their first meeting the scenario is as obvious as a cheese her eyes half-lidded turn away the cup lifted to her lips the captain has questions about the flooding of the water-meadow a furious but undirected energy governs her soul listless as she seems on the surface it is a libido on auto-destruct opportunities occur but the doctor in complacent rectitude bows himself off the stage of further meetings he devotes himself to his patients they however begin to avoid him as if he has some dreadful disease when the captain is lost on the glacier his horse riderless returning to graze on the bowling-green the doctor is suspected it is most unfair meanwhile his orphaned cousins go ahead with their threatened law-suit at first he is amused he meets their legal representative over a schnapps in the bahnhof buffet and is compromised by the leather luggage of the absconding wife he claims to have found a cure for the epidemic of goitres but only succeeds in killing two maids and a barley farmer the captain ’ s wife is staying at interlaken with the schoolmaster ’ s wastrel son her insane letters are read out in court evidence of the doctor ’ s malpractice only his good old nurse refuses to disbelieve him on her death-bed she grips his fingers tightly and mutters inaudibly about the lost diaries there is nothing now to prevent the red-haired cousins from taking complete control of his estate the doctor has lost everything and gained nothing at the back of his mind there is still the slight hope that time will explain to him his crucial role he becomes a cutter of peat and realises that it is never quite easy enough to disappear
the first morning of three mile island those first disquieting uncertain mystifying hours all morning a crew of workmen have been tearing the old decrepit roof off our building and all morning trying to distract myself i ’ ve been wandering out to watch them as they hack away the leaden layers of asbestos paper and disassemble the disintegrating drains after half a night of listening to the news wondering how to know a hundred miles downwind if and when to make a run for it and where then a coming bolt awake at seven when the roofers we ’ ve been waiting for since winter sent their ladders shrieking up our wall we still know less than nothing the utility company continues making little of the accident the slick federal spokesmen still have their evasions in some semblance of order surely we suspect now we ’ re being lied to but in the meantime there are the roofers setting winch-frames sledging rounds of tar apart and there i am on the curb across gawking i never realized what brutal work it is how matter-of-factly and harrowingly dangerous the ladders flex and quiver things skid from the edge the materials are bulky and recalcitrant when the rusty antique nails are levered out their heads pull off the underroofing crumbles even the battered little furnace roaring along as patient as a donkey chokes and clogs a dense malignant smoke shoots up and someone has to fiddle with a cock then hammer it before the gush and stench will deintensify the dark dantean broth wearily subside in its crucible the stuff looks bland like licorice spill it though on your boots or coveralls it sears and everything is permeated with it the furnace gunked with burst and half-burst bubbles the men themselves so completely slashed and mucked they seem almost from another realm like trolls when they take their break they leave their brooms standing at attention in the asphalt pails work gloves clinging like br ’ er rabbit to the bitten shafts and they slouch along the precipitous lip the enormous sky behind them the heavy noontime air alive with shimmers and mirages sometime in the afternoon i had to go inside the advent of our vigil was upon us however much we didn ’ t want to however little we would do about it we ’ d understood we were going to perish of all this if not now then soon if not soon then someday someday some final generation hysterically aswarm beneath an atmosphere as unrelenting as rock would rue us all anathematize our earthly comforts curse our surfeits and submissions i think i know though i might rather not why my roofers stay so clear to me and why the rest the terror of that time the reflexive disbelief and distancing all we should hold on to dims so i remember the president in his absurd protective booties looking absolutely unafraid the fool i remember a woman on the front page glaring across the misty susquehanna at those looming stacks but more vividly the men silvered with glitter from the shingles clinging like starlings beneath the eaves even the leftover carats of tar in the gutter so black they seemed to suck the light out of the air by nightfall kids had come across them every sidewalk on the block was scribbled with obscenities and hearts
for nathaniel 1900—1968 all afternoon you worked at cutting them down branch after branch tossed into the heap you had your ceremony old pants the pipe the pipe rested in the cleft of the tree when the pile got big enough you threw the kerosene now the woods are clouded again you forgot the world could be this messy air thickens into leaves the leaves into worms behind the barn overnight it seems tents have spread out in the apple trees there ’ s work for you so you come back in your pants old as dirt with a pipe heavy as stone no time to lose whatever is rotten whatever won ’ t hold the weight of another season you hack down there ’ s one moment though when you feel almost sorry for them the tents break into flame and the small black pieces of anguish crawl out into the grass those that get away well you let them get away this time
thanksgiving day i like to see our cook perform her witchery she turns a pumpkin into pie as easily as you or i can wave a hand or wink an eye she takes leftover bread and muffin and changes them to turkey stuffin ’ she changes cranberries to sauce and meats to stews and stews to broths and when she mixes gingerbread it turns into a man instead with frosting collar ’ round his throat and raisin buttons down his coat oh some like magic made by wands and some read magic out of books and some like fairy spells and charms but i like magic made by cooks
butch once remarked to me how sinister it was alone after hours in the dark of the shop to find me there hunched over two weeks ’ accounts probably smoked like a bacon from all those pall-malls odd comfort when the light goes the case lights left on and the rings of baloney the herring the parsley arranged in the strict familiar ways whatever intactness holds animals up has been carefully taken what ’ s left are the parts just look in the cases all counted and stacked step-and-a-half waleski used to come to the shop and ask for the cheap cut she would thump sniff and finger this one too old this one here for my supper two days and you do notice change in the texture i have seen them the day before slaughter knowing the outcome from the moment they enter the chute the eye rolls blood is smeared on the lintel mallet or bullet they lunge toward their darkness but something queer happens when the heart is delivered when a child is born sometimes the left hand is stronger you can train it to fail still the knowledge is there that is the knowledge in the hand of a butcher that adds to its weight otto kröger could fell a dray horse with one well-placed punch to the jaw and yet it is well known how thorough he was he never sat down without washing his hands and he was a maker his sausage was echt so that even waleski had little complaint butch once remarked there was no one so deft as my otto so true there is great tact involved in parting the flesh from the bones that it loves how we cling to the bones each joint is a web of small tendons and fibers he knew what i meant when i told him i felt something pull from the left and how often it clouded the day before slaughter something queer happens when the heart is delivered

they clapped when we landed thinking africa was just an extension of the black world they smiled as we taxied home to be met black to black face not understanding africans lack color prejudice they rushed to declare cigarettes money allegiance to the mother land not knowing despite having read fanon and davenport hearing all of j.h clarke ’ s lectures supporting nkrumah in ghana and nigeria in the war that there was once a tribe called afro-americans that populated the whole of africa they stopped running when they learned the packages on the women ’ s heads were heavy and that babies didn ’ t cry and disease is uncomfortable and that villages are fun only because you knew the feel of good leather on good pavement they cried when they saw mercedes benz were as common in lagos as volkswagens are in berlin they shook their heads when they understood there was no difference between the french and the english and the americans and the afro-americans or the tribe next door or the country across the border they were exasperated when they heard sly and the family stone in francophone africa and they finally smiled when little boys who spoke no western tongue said “ james brown ” with reverence they brought out their cameras and bought out africa ’ s drums when they finally realized that they are strangers all over and love is only and always about the lover not the beloved they marveled at the beauty of the people and the richness of the land knowing they could never possess either they clapped when they took off for home despite the dead dream they saw a free future

the time you won your town the race we chaired you through the market-place man and boy stood cheering by and home we brought you shoulder-high today the road all runners come shoulder-high we bring you home and set you at your threshold down townsman of a stiller town smart lad to slip betimes away from fields where glory does not stay and early though the laurel grows it withers quicker than the rose eyes the shady night has shut can not see the record cut and silence sounds no worse than cheers after earth has stopped the ears now you will not swell the rout of lads that wore their honours out runners whom renown outran and the name died before the man so set before its echoes fade the fleet foot on the sill of shade and hold to the low lintel up the still-defended challenge-cup and round that early-laurelled head will flock to gaze the strengthless dead and find unwithered on its curls the garland briefer than a girl ’ s
to go to lvov which station for lvov if not in a dream at dawn when dew gleams on a suitcase when express trains and bullet trains are being born to leave in haste for lvov night or day in september or in march but only if lvov exists if it is to be found within the frontiers and not just in my new passport if lances of trees —of poplar and ash—still breathe aloud like indians and if streams mumble their dark esperanto and grass snakes like soft signs in the russian language disappear into thickets to pack and set off to leave without a trace at noon to vanish like fainting maidens and burdocks green armies of burdocks and below under the canvas of a venetian café the snails converse about eternity but the cathedral rises you remember so straight as straight as sunday and white napkins and a bucket full of raspberries standing on the floor and my desire which wasn ’ t born yet only gardens and weeds and the amber of queen anne cherries and indecent fredro there was always too much of lvov no one could comprehend its boroughs hear the murmur of each stone scorched by the sun at night the orthodox church ’ s silence was unlike that of the cathedral the jesuits baptized plants leaf by leaf but they grew grew so mindlessly and joy hovered everywhere in hallways and in coffee mills revolving by themselves in blue teapots in starch which was the first formalist in drops of rain and in the thorns of roses frozen forsythia yellowed by the window the bells pealed and the air vibrated the cornets of nuns sailed like schooners near the theater there was so much of the world that it had to do encores over and over the audience was in frenzy and didn ’ t want to leave the house my aunts couldn ’ t have known yet that i ’ d resurrect them and lived so trustfully so singly servants clean and ironed ran for fresh cream inside the houses a bit of anger and great expectation brzozowski came as a visiting lecturer one of my uncles kept writing a poem entitled why dedicated to the almighty and there was too much of lvov it brimmed the container it burst glasses overflowed each pond lake smoked through every chimney turned into fire storm laughed with lightning grew meek returned home read the new testament slept on a sofa beside the carpathian rug there was too much of lvov and now there isn ’ t any it grew relentlessly and the scissors cut it chilly gardeners as always in may without mercy without love ah wait till warm june comes with soft ferns boundless fields of summer i.e. the reality but scissors cut it along the line and through the fiber tailors gardeners censors cut the body and the wreaths pruning shears worked diligently as in a child ’ s cutout along the dotted line of a roe deer or a swan scissors penknives and razor blades scratched cut and shortened the voluptuous dresses of prelates of squares and houses and trees fell soundlessly as in a jungle and the cathedral trembled people bade goodbye without handkerchiefs no tears such a dry mouth i won ’ t see you anymore so much death awaits you why must every city become jerusalem and every man a jew and now in a hurry just pack always each day and go breathless go to lvov after all it exists quiet and pure as a peach it is everywhere
you are riding the bus again burrowing into the blackness of interstate 80 the sole passenger with an overhead light on and i am with you i ’ m the interminable fields you can ’ t see the little lights off in the distance in one of those rooms we are living and i am the rain and the others all around you and the loneliness you love and the universe that loves you specifically maybe and the catastrophic dawn the nicotine crawling on your skin— and when you begin to cough i won ’ t cover my face and if you vomit this time i will hold you everything ’ s going to be fine i will whisper it won ’ t always be like this i am going to buy you a sandwich
the way bed is in winter like an aproned lap like furry mittens like childhood crouching under tables the ninth day of xmas in the morning black outside our window clattering cans the whir of a hopper shouts a whistle move on ... i see them in my warm imagination the way i ’ ll see them later in the cold heaving the huge cans and running running to the next house on the street my vestiges of muscle stir uneasily in their percale cocoon what moves those men out there what drives them running to the next house and the next halfway back to dream i speculate the social weal “ let ’ s make good old bloomington a cleaner place to live in—right men hup tha ” healthy competition “ come on boys let ’ s burn up that route today and beat those dudes on truck thirteen ” enlightened self-interest “ another can another dollar—don ’ t slow down mac i ’ m puttin ’ three kids through princeton ” or something else terror a half hour later dawn comes edging over clark street layers of color laid out like a flattened rainbow—red then yellow green and over that the black-and-blue of night still hanging on clark street maples wave their silhouettes against the red and through the twiggy trees i see a solid chunk of garbage truck and stick-figures of men like windup toys tossing little cans— and running all day they ’ ll go like that till dark again and all day people fussing at their desks at hot stoves at machines will jettison tin cans bare evergreens damp kleenex all things that are caesar ’ s o garbage men the new year greets you like the old after this first run you too may rest in beds like great warm aproned laps and know that people everywhere have faith putting from them all things of this world they confidently bide your second coming
so you see why it could not have been a more humble moment if there was any outward sign of regalia it might have been the twilight crowning of the day just then a perfect moment of dusk but changing as a wave does even as you admire it because the southbound stop mirrors the one northbound where we so often find ourselves at the beginning southbound ’ s return holds the memory of northbound ’ s setting-out and the grassy median between with its undisturbed trees defines an elusive strip of the present where no one lives after twenty-eight years of the trip it ’ s like two beakers of colored water — one green one blue — have poured themselves back and forth because on one side we are tinted by remembering the other but this aspect of the journey at least we know we will repeat as dusk cohered that moment — aquas pinks violets — just at that moment as i was returning to the car a woman came the other way her two young daughters holding her hands and the gloaming sparkled around them so that i froze as they were backlit starry they were the southbound reminder of who i had been beginning the trip she didn ’ t look like me but what i did recognize was her clarity of purpose in what sharon olds called the days of great usefulness making life as nice as she could for them always writing the best story and also beneath her skin living with delight as quiet as the shoots anchoring grass beneath the earth i walked back to my car my husband sat in the driver ’ s seat our weekend ’ s luggage thrown in back tell me we really had those girls i said and that they held my hands like that when i got home i pictured her helping them each into bed — i knew it was later than she had hoped — then reading each section of the paper ’ s terrible news finally alone
one son plays monster rage his brother plays ship crashed in a maze we are reading hulk we are reading theseus white sails green men bright women who give everything and get nothing the monster son would never sail a ship into a maze but brothers are not the same they hear the same stories and make different toys of them muscled figures in their fists walls of wood and magnets who knows why a part of me always departs this place glides out the window to rain and falling leaves dresses of wetness and gold she floats there blessed by air but when she tries to slip back in she can ’ t she hangs beyond the glass panicked then bulging with fury days later another part of me flies into a maple the color of platelets and another into bareness and sky i ’ ve lost count of how many fists are now pounding my house how many mouths are braying how many cries but here inside for now my dear sons call to me for their fallen castles built again to find all the missing arrows
past fences the first sheepmen cast across the land processions of cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishing point like fretboards carrying barbed melodies windharp narratives songs of place i ’ m thinking of the long cowboy ballads ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught me the ends if he could have remembered them but remembering was years ago when ray swamped for ranches at a dollar a day and found and played guitar in a saturday night band and now he is dead and i ’ m remembering near the end when he just needed a drink before he could tie his shoes we ’ d stay up all night playing the beginnings of songs like falling leaf about a girl who died of grief and zebra dun about a horse that pawed the light out of the moon sometimes ray would break through and recall a few more verses before he ’ d drop a line or scramble a rhyme or just go blank and his workfat hands would drop the chords and fall away in disbelief between songs he ’ d pull on the rum or unleash coughing fits that sounded like nails in a paper bag done he ’ d straighten and say my cough ’ s not just right i need another cigarette and light the parliament he bit at an upward angle like roosevelt and play the start of another song then played out and drunk enough to go home he ’ d pick up his hat and case and make it usually on the second try through the front gate and gently list out into the early morning dark beginning again some song without end yodeling his vote under spangles

i leave you in your garden in the yard behind it run the airedales you have reared with boxer ’ s vigilance and poet ’ s rigour dog-generations you have trained the vigour that few can breed to train and fewer still control with the deliberate human will and in the house there rest piled shelf on shelf the accumulations that compose the self— poem and history for if we use words to maintain the actions that we choose our words with slow defining influence stay to mark out our chosen lineaments continual temptation waits on each to renounce his empire over thought and speech till he submit his passive faculties to evening come where no resistance is the unmotivated sadness of the air filling the human with his own despair where now lies power to hold the evening back implicit in the grey is total black denial of the discriminating brain brings the neurotic vision and the vein of necromancy all as relative for mind as for the sense we have to live in a half-world not ours nor history ’ s and learn the false from half-true premisses but sitting in the dusk—though shapes combine vague mass replacing edge and flickering line you keep both rule and energy in view much power in each most in the balanced two ferocity existing in the fence built by an exercised intelligence though night is always close complete negation ready to drop on wisdom and emotion night from the air or the carnivorous breath still it is right to know the force of death and as you do persistent tough in will raise from the excellent the better still
during a tempest encountered homeward-bound from the mediterranean a grizzled petty-officer one of the two captains of the forecastle dying at night in his hammock swung in the sick-bay under the tiered gun-decks of the british dreadnought 98 wandering in his mind though with glimpses of sanity and starting up at whiles sings by snatches his good-bye and last injunctions to two messmates his watchers one of whom fans the fevered tar with the flap of his old sou'-wester some names and phrases with here and there a line or part of one these in his aberration wrested into incoherency from their original connection and import he involuntarily derives as he does the measure from a famous old sea-ditty whose cadences long rife and now humming in the collapsing brain attune the last flutterings of distempered thought farewell and adieu to you noble hearties — farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain for i ’ ve received orders for to sail for the deadman but hope with the grand fleet to see you again i have hove my ship to with main-top-sail aback boys i have hove my ship to for to strike soundings clear— the black scud a ’ flying but by god ’ s blessing dam ’ me right up the channel for the deadman i ’ ll steer i have worried through the waters that are call d the doldrums and growled at sargasso that clogs while ye grope— blast my eyes but the light-ship is hid by the mist lads — flying dutchman—odds bobbs—off the cape of good hope but what ’ s this i feel that is fanning my cheek matt the white goney ’ s wing —how she rolls — ’ t is the cape give my kit to the mess jock for kin none is mine none and tell holy joe to avast with the crape dead reckoning says joe it won ’ t do to go by but they doused all the glims matt in sky t ’ other night dead reckoning is good for to sail for the deadman and tom deadlight he thinks it may reckon near right the signal —it streams for the grand fleet to anchor the captains—the trumpets—the hullabaloo stand by for blue-blazes and mind your shank-painters for the lord high admiral he ’ s squinting at you but give me my tot matt before i roll over jock let ’ s have your flipper it ’ s good for to feel and don ’ t sew me up without baccy in mouth boys and don ’ t blubber like lubbers when i turn up my keel

i have arrived here after taking many steps over the kitchen floors of friends and through their lives the dun-colored hills have been good to me and the gold rivers i have loved chrysantheumums and children i have been grandmother to some in one pocket i have hidden chocolates from you and knives speaking my real thoughts to no one in bars and at lecterns i have told the truth fairly often but hardly ever to myself i have not cried out against the crimes of my country but i have protected myself i have watched from a safe corner the rape of mountains the eagle ’ s reckless plunge ever since high school i have waved goodbye to history i have assisted you to grow in all ways that were convenient to me what is a block vote against steam shovels my current events teacher was a fine man but his moral precepts were a put-up job and i followed them well-dressed in my new adidas at every gathering i investigated my psyche with friends and they investigated theirs with me but whenever trouble came in the front door i ran out the back and fell into the pit of my bones escaped from those burning buildings the past what balance can any of us hope for i was comparing lipsticks the day nagasaki vanished the day solzhenitsyn disappeared into the gulag i was attending a cocktail party perhaps there are only ashes in my handbag a man at the corner of broadway and forty-second street tried to sweep me into a trash barrel and i almost agreed already the dried blood was sifting along my wrists already my own hands were tightening around my throat but sorrow saved me sorrow gave me an image of bombs like human tears watering the world ’ s gardens how could i not answer since then i have been planting words in every windowbox poking them to grow up what ’ s god that he should be mindful of me sometimes i feel like wood waiting for someone to peel me indeed i have been lukewarm at heart which is all that matters of tiny bread-colored atoms equal fragments equally dispersed that love each other and are never hungry what have i ever ignited that warmed anyone i have not followed the rivers dangerous as a pine needle packed in among others in the dense multitudes and dry timbers of the west i am afraid of greed the rich taste of it the anger hidden in my pockets columns of smoke on the horizon pillars of green fire but i have arrived here somehow neither have i stopped talking numberless are the kitchens i have sat in chewing my fingers trying to say something anything so that the daughters of men should see as many sides of themselves as possible word after word my footprints have stumbled across deserts how should i escape them they keep following after me a little wind stirs itself whisks across my eyelids and i know what it is before i say it what if the world really articulates itself in the socket of a human knee god save me from the swamps of hubris but it may be it may be before the idea the impulse i feel it moving in me it is there arthritic but still powerful a seizure delicate as grasshoppers a light gathering in the skull between thumb and forefinger and the ballbearing joints of the tongue in soft glottal convulsions out of no alien skies but out of the mind ’ s muscle the hieroglyph figures rise the little histories of words can not be eaten i know it you know it and the children ... but the images we make are our own in the cool caves of the intellect the twisted roots of them lead us backwards and then forwards if only we could understand what ’ s in our pockets is for everyone i have a dictionary in one hand a mirror strangers look at themselves in it tracing the expressions they use from one family to the next they comfort themselves murmuring the tongues we speak are a blizzard of words like warm wool flying in the shy conjugal rites of verb consonant vowel in the dark mucosal flesh lining the prismed underside of the skin each one is a spark sheared from the veined fleece of the spirit of the looking-glass body we live in it is the one i have been cherishing the one all of us speak from for the world as we know it moves necessarily by steps breath pulse beat ten digital stops at the foot of the mountains i look up does god lift up his hand to cover them blinded by tears like rain my bones turn granite the spine of the hills congeals them where is the eye of the storm or where is the center of my seeing the wind of my breath is a hurricane i am locked inside myself painfully up the bald stepladder i climb but sometimes the light in my head goes on more like the sun than a match just as they said in arabia there ’ s a huge pantalooned angel swelling inside the body ’ s glass jar the white-haired thread of steam from the teakettle on the range whistles and sharpens itself into a voice bodiless as history invisible but still whispering in ears that keep trying to hear it it is as if midgets were bellowing their names down sets of cardboard cylinders but we have not disappeared yet my friends we have said many things to each other in new combinations seed upon seed exploding and blossoming in kitchen gardens i confess i am ashamed of myself i have not tried hard enough to understand or listen to you speak but the word is mindful of itself and always has been littering every street in the sly eyes of tin cans drops of water in the gutter the world looks back at us from every known language yoruba hebrew chinese arrogant english the subject subjecting all to its desires even the softer tongues romantic self-reflexive done to as we would be done by whatever life we cultivate out of the animal moans of childhood it is all wheat fields all grass growing and being grown with poisoned bread in my pockets or gumdrops or armies like myrmidons rising what i say is true for a time only thank god if i have only arrived anywhere it is to look carefully at all i thought i knew in living rivers of speech the reflections i make are my own and yet not though the old growth rings are hidden from us and the echoing tomorrows of the acorn the warm currents of the senses are a two-way street my friends the palms of our hands are crisscrossed with as many intersections as a leaf
one of those men who can be a car salesman or a tourist from syracuse or a hired assassin john d. macdonald you would not recognize me mine is the face which blooms in the dank mirrors of washrooms as you grope for the light switch my eyes have the expression of the cold eyes of statues watching their pigeons return from the feed you have scattered and i stand on my corner with the same marble patience if i move at all it is at the same pace precisely as the shade of the awning under which i stand waiting and with whose blackness it seems i am already blended i speak seldom and always in a murmur as quiet as that of crowds which surround the victims of accidents shall i confess who i am my name is all names and none i am the used-car salesman the tourist from syracuse the hired assassin waiting i will stand here forever like one who has missed his bus— familiar anonymous— on my usual corner the corner at which you turn to approach that place where now you must not hope to arrive

humps of shell emerge from dark water believers toss hunks of bread hoping the fat reptilian heads will loom forth from the murk and eat meaning you have been heard i stood breathing the stench of mud and rotten dough and could not feel encouraged climbed the pilgrim hill where prayers in tissue radiant tubes were looped to a tree caught in their light a hope washed over me small as the hope of stumbling feet but did not hold long enough to get me down rickshas crowded the field announced by tinny bells the friend beside me whose bread floated and bobbed grew grim they ’ re full i told him but they always eat mine that night i told the man i love most he came from hell it was also his birthday we gulped lobster over a white tablecloth in a country where waves erase whole villages annually and don ’ t even make our front page waiters forded the lulling currents of heat later my mosquito net had holes all night i was pitching something crumbs or crusts into that bottomless pool where the spaces between our worlds take root he would forgive me tomorrow but i wanted a mouth to rise up from the dark a hand any declarable body part to swallow or say this is water that is land
1 when clumsy harks the gladsome ting-a-lings of dinner chimes that mrs. clumsy rings his two hands winglike at his most bald head then clumsy readies clumsy to be fed he pulls from satchel huge a tiny chair and waggling his pillowed derriere he hitches up his pants to gently sit like two ecstatic doves his white hands flit tucking his bib in quickly then all thumbs they brush away imaginary crumbs from knee-high table with dismissive air with fists wrapped round his giant silverware he shuts his eyes and puckers up for kisses in such a pose clumsy awaits his mrs. rubbing his hungry ribs but oh alack quite unbeknownst to clumsy at his back the circle of a second spotlight shows that no-no has delivered fatal blows to mrs. clumsy since that happy time she summoned clumsy with her dinner chime and there is clumsy ’ s darling lying dead how like a rubber ball bounces her head as no-no drags her feet-first from this life then no-no dresses up as clumsy ’ s wife her scarf now silhouettes his long hooked nose his long bones rattle in her frilly clothes as no-no brings a tray of cups and plates into the light where puckered clumsy waits hearing her footstep soft makes clumsy take the pucker from his lips and sweetly break into falsetto greetings then resume his lips into a kiss but this is doom and hideously silent no-no stands when clumsy parts his eyelids both his hands fly up as if on strings and clumsy screams the tears squirt from his ducts a dozen streams his mouth blubbers inelegantly smeared “ where is she no-no oh i am afeared ” then no-no lifts up clumsy ’ s trembly chin and leans to hiss with loud stage whisper in the big pink ear of clumsy “ my dear friend ” no-no enunciates “ this is the end. ” 2 disguised as doctor of philosophy in academic haberdashery by dint of hood and black capacious gown no-no wipes off the blackboard up and down his black sleeve floating outward with each lunge the black streaks glisten from his dampened sponge while clumsy sharpens pencils two feet long to little stubs and wets them with his tongue then smooths his pad of paper with gloved fists he lifts his sleeves a fraction at the wrists and twirls his hands around like windmill sails to soothe his nerves then drums his muffled nails until the doctor claps his hands rat-tat and picks his pointer up and points it at his eager pupil with the jumbo ears “ compose a paragraph. ” and clumsy clears his throat a dozen times to soft aver “ i don ’ t know how to write with letters sir. ” at which the doctor hides with sleeve a smile most uncontrollable and fraught with guile until authority regained he says “ in that case you may dictate sentences which you most wish to write and i ’ ll record your words for you to copy from the board. ” now clumsy tries to think of what to write he cranes his neck around stage-left and -right he gazes toward the rafters thinking hard and sometimes shakes his head as to discard ideas he finds less than adequate then caroling a joyous “ i know what ” he pulls a giant lightbulb from a sack and holds it overhead and puts it back and in his vast excitement both his hands pull up his earlobe-anchored rubber bands to lift from scalp his tiny frizzy wig “ i ’ d like to start with ‘ god is very big. ’ ” erupting laughter nearly knocks quite down the doctor in his nearly empty gown he whirls on heel and cuts his hooting off “ my theologian fellow philosophe your disquisition has the resonance of truth ’ s unique unutterable sense but yet being pedantic and antique this mind of mine must tinker weigh and seek and wonder if together you and i for sake of scholarship should specify how big god is ” thus groping for the truth about the size of god makes pink smoke poof from clumsy ’ s ears in jets and fire alarms go off backstage as lowered head on arms full sixty seconds clumsy cogitates the doctor snaps his chalk in two and waits clumsy looks up and no-no utters “ yes ” “ bigger than the biggest clouds i guess. ” “ bigger than clouds dear fellow i should say i never would have thought of god that way then let ’ s begin. ” and no-no sets the chalk tick-ticking on the board like time-bomb clock while clumsy wraps his pencil finger-wise and sets it on the page and squints his eyes at no-no ’ s blackboard words so white and clean and neat and straight with spaces in between and then his page two inches from his nose he copies out in crooked uphill rows “ i clumsy hereby give and wittingly my soul to no-no for eternity ”

there was a frozen tree that i wanted to paint but the shells came down and in vegas looking across at a green sunshade at 3:30 in the morning i died without nails without a copy of the atlantic monthly the windows screamed like doves moaning the bombing of milan and i went out to live with the rats but the lights were too bright and i thought maybe i 'd better go back and sit in a poetry class a marvelous description of a gazelle is hell the cross sits like a fly on my window my mother ’ s breath stirs small leaves in my mind and i hitch-hiked back to l.a. through hangover clouds and i pulled a letter from my pocket and read it and the truckdriver said what ’ s that and i said there 's some gal up north who used to sleep with pound she 's trying to tell me that h.d was our greatest scribe well hilda gave us a few pink grecian gods in with the chinaware but after reading her i still have 140 icicles hanging from my bones i 'm not going all the way to l.a. the truckdriver said it 's all right i said the calla lilies nod to our minds and someday we ’ ll all go home together in fact he said this is as far as we go so i let him have it old withered whore of time your breasts taste the sour cream of dreaming he let me out in the middle of the desert to die is to die is to die old phonographs in cellars joe di maggio magazines in with the onions an old ford picked me up 45 minutes later and this time i kept my mouth shut
waking on the train i thought we were attacked by light chrome-winged birds hatching from the lagoon that first day the buoys were all that made the harbor bearable pennies sewn into a hemline later i learned to live in it to walk through the alien city— a beekeeper ’ s habit— with fierce light clinging to my head and hands treated as gently as every other guest— each house ’ s barbed antennae trawling for any kind of weather— still i sobbed in a glass box on an unswept street with the last few lire ticking like fleas off my phonecard i ’ m sorry i can ’ t stand this which one of us do you love
in your extended absence you permit me use of earth anticipating some return on investment i must report failure in my assignment principally regarding the tomato plants i think i should not be encouraged to grow tomatoes or if i am you should withhold the heavy rains the cold nights that come so often here while other regions get twelve weeks of summer all this belongs to you on the other hand i planted the seeds i watched the first shoots like wings tearing the soil and it was my heart broken by the blight the black spot so quickly multiplying in the rows i doubt you have a heart in our understanding of that term you who do not discriminate between the dead and the living who are in consequence immune to foreshadowing you may not know how much terror we bear the spotted leaf the red leaves of the maple falling even in august in early darkness i am responsible for these vines

the shape of it bending like an eel or disfigured quarter moon pink and green and brown like a rainbow trout the wall along my bed covered with the map i cut from the newspaper and next to it the fishing calendar from abonauder ’ s texaco the square cages of days with their numerals and effigies of moon and fish shaded to indicate the shape of the moon the hunger of the fish the white bread stripped of its crust dampened then dusted with flour compressed into a tight ball wrapped in foil and chilled all night a piece of it pressed and shaped on the tip of an eagle claw hook then lowered into the nesting holes of blue gill the plastic bobber floating on the surface like a silent doorbell a whole world of cause and effect framed day-by-day and week-by-week the passage of time as a kind of game in which i transferred numbers from the newspaper to the calendar the body counts and their categories of nvra marines montagnards and each morning i put a bold x through the previous day not to erase or forget it but to connect the corners make four triangles of the square and it was rare if not impossible to catch the blue gill that swam and swam around the tidy pebble craters of their nests or coax them out except in hostile swerves and feints toward the bait that hung like a balloon of gravity over their homes a suspicious egg pouch or cocoon something a storm might have dislodged from the bank and blown like a feared gift into the water a thing swallowed whole then run with until the line played out and the hook set fast

deep st. mary ’ s bell had sounded and the twelve notes gently rounded endless chimneys that surrounded my abode in trinity letter g old court south attics i shut up my mathematics that confounded hydrostatics— sink it in the deepest sea in the grate the flickering embers served to show how dull november ’ s fogs had stamped my torpid members like a plucked and skinny goose and as i prepared for bed i asked myself with voice unsteady if of all the stuff i read i ever made the slightest use late to bed and early rising ever luxury despising ever training never “ sizing ” i have suffered with the rest yellow cheek and forehead ruddy memory confused and muddy these are the effects of study of a subject so unblest look beyond and see the wrangler now become a college dangler court some

result no further goes. ” much he lauds the education which has raised to lofty station men whose powers of calculation calculation ’ s self defied how the learned fool would wonder were he now to see his blunder when he put his reason under the control of worldly pride thus i muttered very seedy husky was my throat and reedy and no wonder for indeed i now had caught a dreadful cold thickest fog had settled slowly round the candle burning lowly round the fire where melancholy traced retreating hills of gold still those papers lay before me— problems made express to bore me when a silent change came o ’ er me in my hard uneasy chair fire and fog and candle faded spectral forms the room invaded little creatures that paraded on the problems lying there fathers there of every college led the glorious ranks of knowledge men whose virtues all acknowledge levied the proctorial fines there the modest moderators set apart as arbitrators ’ twixt contending calculators scrutinised the trembling lines all the costly apparatus that is meant to elevate us to the intellectual status necessary for degrees— college tutors—private coaches— line the senate-house approaches if our alma mater dote she ’ s taken care of well by these much i doubted if the vision were the simple repetition of the statements of commission strangely jumbled oddly placed when an awful form ascended and with cruel words defended those abuses that offended my unsanctioned private taste angular in form and feature unlike any earthly creature she had properties to meet your eye whatever you might view hair of pens and skin of paper breath not breath but chemic vapour dress —such dress as college draper fashions with precision due eyes of glass with optic axes twisting rays of light as flax is twisted while the parallax is made to show the real size primary and secondary focal lines in planes contrary sum up all that ’ s known to vary in those dull unmeaning eyes such the eyes through which all nature seems reduced to meaner stature if you had them you would hate your symbolising sense of sight seeing planets in their courses thick beset with arrowy “ forces ” while the common eye no more sees than their mild and quiet light “ son ” she said what could be queerer than thus tête-a -tête to hear her talk in tones approaching nearer to a saw ’ s than aught beside for the voice the spectre spoke in might be known by many a token to proceed from metal broken when acoustic tricks were tried little pleased to hear the siren “ own ” me thus with voice of iron i had thoughts of just retiring from a mother such a fright “ no ” she said “ the time is pressing so before i give my blessing i ’ ll excuse you from confessing what you thought of me to-night “ powers ” she cried with hoarse devotion “ give my son the clearest notion how to compass sure promotion and take care of number one let his college course be pleasant let him ever as at present seem to have read what he hasn ’ t and to do what can ’ t be done of the philosophic spirit richly may my son inherit as for poetry inter it with the myths of other days cut the thing entirely lest yon college don should put the question why not stick to what you ’ re best on mathematics always pays. ” as the hag was thus proceeding to prescribe my course of reading and as i was faintly pleading hardly knowing what to say suddenly my head inclining i beheld a light form shining and the withered beldam whining saw the same and slunk away then the vision growing brighter seemed to make my garret lighter as when noisome fogs of night are scattered by the rising sun nearer still it grew and nearer till my straining eyes caught clearer glimpses of a being dearer dearer still than number one in that well-remembered vision i was led to the decision still to hold in calm derision pedantry however draped since that artificial spectre proved a paltry sub-collector and had nothing to connect her with the being whom she aped i could never finish telling you of her that has her dwelling where those springs of truth are welling whence all streams of beauty run she has taught me that creation bears the test of calculation but that man forgets his station if he stops when that is done is our algebra the measure of that unexhausted treasure that affords the purest pleasure ever found when it is sought let us rather realising the conclusions thence arising nature more than symbols prizing learn to worship as we ought worship yes what worship better than when free ’ d from every fetter that the uninforming letter rivets on the tortured mind man with silent admiration sees the glories of creation and in holy contemplation leaves the learned crowd behind

to walk abroad is not with eyes but thoughts the fields to see and prize else may the silent feet like logs of wood move up and down and see no good nor joy nor glory meet ev ’ n carts and wheels their place do change but can not see though very strange the glory that is by dead puppets may move in the bright and glorious day yet not behold the sky and are not men than they more blind who having eyes yet never find the bliss in which they move like statues dead they up and down are carried yet never see nor love to walk is by a thought to go to move in spirit to and fro to mind the good we see to taste the sweet observing all the things we meet how choice and rich they be to note the beauty of the day and golden fields of corn survey admire each pretty flow ’ r with its sweet smell to praise their maker and to tell the marks of his great pow ’ r to fly abroad like active bees among the hedges and the trees to cull the dew that lies on ev ’ ry blade from ev ’ ry blossom till we lade our minds as they their thighs observe those rich and glorious things the rivers meadows woods and springs the fructifying sun to note from far the rising of each twinkling star for us his race to run a little child these well perceives who tumbling in green grass and leaves may rich as kings be thought but there ’ s a sight which perfect manhood may delight to which we shall be brought while in those pleasant paths we talk ’ tis that tow ’ rds which at last we walk for we may by degrees wisely proceed pleasures of love and praise to heed from viewing herbs and trees
i wanted to know what it was like before we had voices and before we had bare fingers and before we had minds to move us through our actions and tears to help us over our feelings so i drove my daughter through the snow to meet her friend and filled her car with suitcases and hugged her as an animal would pressing my forehead against her walking in circles moaning touching her cheek and turned my head after them as an animal would watching helplessly as they drove over the ruts her smiling face and her small hand just visible over the giant pillows and coat hangers as they made their turn into the empty highway
man he said sitting on the steps your car sure needs a wash and wax job i can do it for you for 5 bucks i got the wax i got the rags i got everything i need i gave him the 5 and went upstairs when i came down 4 hours later he was sitting on the steps drunk and offered me a can of beer he said he ’ d get the car the next day the next day he got drunk again and i loaned him a dollar for a bottle of wine his name was mike a world war ii veteran his wife worked as a nurse the next day i came down and he was sitting on the steps and he said you know i been sitting here looking at your car wondering just how i was gon na do it i wan na do it real good the next day mike said it looked like rain and it sure as hell wouldn ’ t make any sense to wash and wax a car when it was gon na rain the next day it looked like rain again and the next then i didn ’ t see him anymore a week later i saw his wife and she said they took mike to the hospital he ’ s all swelled-up they say it ’ s from the drinking listen i told her he said he was going to wax my car i gave him 5 dollars to wax my car he ’ s in the critical ward she said he might die i was sitting in their kitchen drinking with his wife when the phone rang she handed the phone to me it was mike listen he said come down and get me i can ’ t stand this place i drove on down there walked into the hospital walked up to his bed and said let ’ s go mike they wouldn ’ t give him his clothes so mike walked to the elevator in his gown we got on and there was a kid driving the elevator and eating a popsicle nobody ’ s allowed to leave here in a gown he said you just drive this thing kid i said we ’ ll worry about the gown mike was all puffed-up triple size but i got him into the car somehow and gave him a cigarette i stopped at the liquor store for 2 six packs then went on in i drank with mike and his wife until 11 p.m. then went upstairs where ’ s mike i asked his wife 3 days later you know he said he was going to wax my car mike died she said he ’ s gone you mean he died i asked yes he died she said i ’ m sorry i said i ’ m very sorry it rained for a week after that and i figured the only way i ’ d get the 5 back was to go to bed with his wife but you know she moved out 2 weeks later an old guy with white hair moved in there and he had one blind eye and played the french horn there was no way i could make it with him
there we go in cars did you guess we wore sandals carrying the till memorizing its numbers apt at the essential such as rearranging languages they occur from route to route like savages who wear shells “ i can not place him. ” yet i do he must ascend indefinitely as airs he must regard his image as plastic adhering to the easeful carpet that needs footprints and cares for them as is their wont in houses the ones we pass by such a day/or such a night reeling from cabin to cabin looking at the cakewalk or merely dancing these adventures in broad/or slim lamplight yet the cars do not cheat even their colors perform in storm we never feel the scratch they do when lightning strikes it ’ s safer to ride on rubber going down a mountain safer than trees or sand more preventive to be hid in a cloud we sing remembering the old manse and robins one tear a salty one knowing we have escaped the charm of being native even as your glance through the windshield tells me you ’ ve seen another mishap of nature you would willingly forget prefer to be like him near the hearth where woodsmoke makes a screen of numbers and signs where the bedstead it ’ s not so foreign as this lake the plateau excursionist is ahead after that twenty volumes of farmland then i must guide us to the wood garage someone has whitened where the light enters through one window like a novel you must peer at it without weakening without feeling hero or heroine understanding the distances between characters their wakeful or sleep searchingness as far from the twilight ring the slow sunset the quick dark
the incoherent rushing of the train dulls like a drugged pain numbs to an ether throbbing of inaudible drums unfolds hush within hush until the night withholds only its darkness from the deep dark a voice calls like a voice in sleep slowly a strange name in a strange tongue among the sleeping listeners a sound as leaves stir faintly on the ground when snow falls from a windless sky— a stir a sigh
be strong bernadette nobody will ever know i came here for a reason perhaps there is a life here of not being afraid of your own heart beating do not be afraid of your own heart beating look at very small things with your eyes stay warm nothing outside can cure you but everything 's outside there is great shame for the world in knowing you may have gone this far perhaps this is why you love the presence of other people so much perhaps this is why you wait so impatiently you have nothing more to teach until there is no more panic at the knowledge of your own real existence then only special childish laughter to be shown no more lies no more not to find you no more coming back more returning southern journey small things not my own debris something to fight against we are all very fluent about ourselves our own ideas of food a wild sauce there 's not much point in its being over but we do not speak them i had written `` the man who sewed his soles back on his feet '' and then i panicked most at the sound of what the wind could do to me if i crawled back to the house two feet give no position if the branches cracked over my head their threatening me if i covered my face with beer sweated till you returned if i suffered what else could i do

for william kittredge 1. that woman still lives at her ranch you can ask her maybe she knows as near and far as the rest of us can tell the barn and sheds were built in the great depression someone had money and a big idea far and away the biggest idea i ’ ve ever seen pat says there must ’ ve been a hundred men shepherds and shearers working there it ’ s one of those things that not only is but seems larger inside than out like a planetarium or an orange even with wyoming around it and real stars flying away just stick your head in there its dark will make you dizzy it has an underneath too low to stand in unless you are a sheep the loft vaults like a dusky church 2. all that summer i balanced water coaxing the desert into pasture with eight cubic feet per second for two thousand acres horseback shovel on my shoulder along miles of ditches stalling here releasing there water over the deepening green keeping it living herons and cranes regal in meadows strings of ducklings frothing the ditch to get away 3. one day riding ditches i saw clay he was on the hill against the sky flapping his arms at me they were going to bulldoze the corrals at the shearing sheds intricate maze of gates and pens clay as a kid had built with his father before they lost their ranch before frank died before the family had to move away the new owner was razing everything i guess he had some kind of idea clay didn ’ t need any gates but as pat said that ’ s clay i met them at the shearing sheds pat held a wrecking bar like a steel snake i just can ’ t stand tearin ’ apart all them guys ’ s dreams he said looking shy hell is when you know where you are 4. on the barn roof a loose piece of tin flaps in the wind like a broken wing wyoming whirls in the sun up in the loft a pair of shears oh fifty or sixty years forgotten there floats in noonlight bearing up some dust just a pair of spring-steel scissors two knives joined at the hip with smiling edges an owl the color of things left alone flaps out of the gable door hell is when you know where you are mazes of pens and gates dreaming sheep miles of ditches dreaming green 5. no one living knows who built the shearing sheds unless maybe that woman and i ’ m not about to ask her ever since she tried to stab her husband with a pair of scissors he was ninety-one and barely held her off later she claimed she was just trying to cut his heart medication out of his shirt pocket — dope she called it — and the old man had to leave the ranch where he didn ’ t last long they bulldozed the corrals we got forty gates we took them someplace safe 6. now the vast dim barn floats like an ocean liner whose doldrums are meadows spinning into brush and everywhere you look wyoming hurries off all night the stars make their escape in the loft a pair of shears cuts woolly moonlight all day a piece of roofing slaps in the wind a startled owl flaps out of the gable hell is when you know where you are and it ’ s beautiful you saved the gates for nothing you balanced the water to keep the green from spinning away into sage the same gray as the wing that just now shaded your eyes
about the age of twenty when the first hairfall signals that nature is finished with the organism and we just begin to conceive the use of women having been all this time more enamored of the fountain than the cistern we retire to nursing homes whether they be kaleidoscopic gardens aimed like a blunderbuss of hermeticism at our neighbors or a desperate dream safari through old zambesi where the suicidal waves of angry natives give the illusion that we are advancing rapidly or the crow ’ s-nest of this windless office block where the cook is already boiling the last sail and sitting on the bench like a snowfall of beard expectorated by a cloudy hat we consider the byproducts of life such as to name only the least offensive to the nose the body itself when it has finally reached that eminence from which all is visible and from which it nonetheless feels the need to move on to a homestead of its dreams like an abandoned chicken coop on the sandy streamside under the tulip poplars and to words which result from an instinct for what is impossible to soften the blow for others including ourselves
the birds against the april wind flew northward singing as they flew they sang “ the land we leave behind has swords for corn-blades blood for dew. ” “ o wild-birds flying from the south what saw and heard ye gazing down ” “ we saw the mortar ’ s upturned mouth the sickened camp the blazing town “ beneath the bivouac ’ s starry lamps we saw your march-worn children die in shrouds of moss in cypress swamps we saw your dead uncoffined lie “ we heard the starving prisoner ’ s sighs and saw from line and trench your sons follow our flight with home-sick eyes beyond the battery ’ s smoking guns. ” “ and heard and saw ye only wrong and pain ” i cried “ o wing-worn flocks ” “ we heard ” they sang “ the freedman ’ s song the crash of slavery ’ s broken locks “ we saw from new uprising states the treason-nursing mischief spurned as crowding freedom ’ s ample gates the long-estranged and lost returned “ o ’ er dusky faces seamed and old and hands horn-hard with unpaid toil with hope in every rustling fold we saw your star-dropt flag uncoil “ and struggling up through sounds accursed a grateful murmur clomb the air a whisper scarcely heard at first it filled the listening heavens with prayer “ and sweet and far as from a star replied a voice which shall not cease till drowning all the noise of war it sings the blessed song of peace ” so to me in a doubtful day of chill and slowly greening spring low stooping from the cloudy gray the wild-birds sang or seemed to sing they vanished in the misty air the song went with them in their flight but lo they left the sunset fair and in the evening there was light
when in wisconsin where i once had time the flyway swans came whistling to the rotten green bay ice and stayed not feeding four days maybe five i shouted and threw stones to see them fly blue herons followed or came first i shot a bittern ’ s wing off with my gun for that my wife could cry my neighbor ’ s wife mistook the spawning frogs for wood ducks nesting the white pines up on bean hill i straightway set her right each april on the first rainy night i lantern-hunt for salamanders where they hide toewalking the bottom mucks and muds i shudder at the scored skin of their sides the deep flesh tucks in hand they dry i walk in frogspawn jellies on my lawns one time i hoped the great white birds might brake for the frog ditch and alight but all the addled past falls in on itself splash rings close inward on the rising stone my gun sucks fire the bone becomes whole bone light narrows back on point and filament the forest turns to sand and only season lacking source rolls round and round till i in my turns fall forever back clutching my stone my gun my light when in wisconsin where i once had time and spring beasts gorged my marrows and my tongue i was not blind the red eft clambered in my eye
when i came to this mountainside almost fifty years ago it never occurred to me that there would be an end to it i went along never thinking about the time when i would have to quit i imagined—i guess — all this would last forever if i imagined it at all now i 'm in my seventies and all i can think about is the time when my life will be here no more for example i love being in the woods felling and bucking hardwood trees stacking and covering the blocks then a year or two later hauling them to the woodshed where i stack them again and split them all winter long into the right size for the weather—then bring them into the house now this chore i love so much is seriously painful and i can see now an end to it
in the southern adriatic where the blue begins we came to rest awhile and play on sun-drenched islands known as tremiti where the breeze blows fresh and pine trees shiver and the salt sea washes the likes of you and me in the southern adriatic in the wind-blown spray in the bluest water just where it begins we came to play awhile came to rest on rocky shores of barren coves as the swells arrived and water splashed and reflected sunlight jumped and shimmered among the cliffs and overhangs and grottoes in the adriatic where that sort of thing begins in the clear blue water that the swells bring by out of the sunny adriatic sea we came to rest and play and bathe ourselves as the pine trees swayed on the bluffs above and wind dispersed the salt sea spray in the sunny adriatic where a way of life begins we came seeking an immersion to find ourselves in waters clear enough to fathom a bottom profoundly blue to see it seemed all the way to greece or any other site that water washed as well or sun could so ignite came to see ourselves in a world of dreams that words might furnish what place implies that place might finish what a word begins we came seeking clearest water sunniest sky came you and i to see what would be seen immersed in waters consummately blue in sunlit swells that carried their dark secret tiny hosts known as meduse whose fragile arms glanced and stung and burned all day and raised the blush that blossomed on our skins aggravated by the sun and spray by our own attempts to hold each other as we swam out of ourselves and were swept away in the southern adriatic where the blue begins
that whitsun i was late getting away not till about one-twenty on the sunlit saturday did my three-quarters-empty train pull out all windows down all cushions hot all sense of being in a hurry gone we ran behind the backs of houses crossed a street of blinding windscreens smelt the fish-dock thence the river ’ s level drifting breadth began where sky and lincolnshire and water meet all afternoon through the tall heat that slept for miles inland a slow and stopping curve southwards we kept wide farms went by short-shadowed cattle and canals with floatings of industrial froth a hothouse flashed uniquely hedges dipped and rose and now and then a smell of grass displaced the reek of buttoned carriage-cloth until the next town new and nondescript approached with acres of dismantled cars at first i didn ’ t notice what a noise the weddings made each station that we stopped at sun destroys the interest of what ’ s happening in the shade and down the long cool platforms whoops and skirls i took for porters larking with the mails and went on reading once we started though we passed them grinning and pomaded girls in parodies of fashion heels and veils all posed irresolutely watching us go as if out on the end of an event waving goodbye to something that survived it struck i leant more promptly out next time more curiously and saw it all again in different terms the fathers with broad belts under their suits and seamy foreheads mothers loud and fat an uncle shouting smut and then the perms the nylon gloves and jewellery-substitutes the lemons mauves and olive-ochres that marked off the girls unreally from the rest yes from cafés and banquet-halls up yards and bunting-dressed coach-party annexes the wedding-days were coming to an end all down the line fresh couples climbed aboard the rest stood round the last confetti and advice were thrown and as we moved each face seemed to define just what it saw departing children frowned at something dull fathers had never known success so huge and wholly farcical the women shared the secret like a happy funeral while girls gripping their handbags tighter stared at a religious wounding free at last and loaded with the sum of all they saw we hurried towards london shuffling gouts of steam now fields were building-plots and poplars cast long shadows over major roads and for some fifty minutes that in time would seem just long enough to settle hats and say i nearly died a dozen marriages got under way they watched the landscape sitting side by side —an odeon went past a cooling tower and someone running up to bowl—and none thought of the others they would never meet or how their lives would all contain this hour i thought of london spread out in the sun its postal districts packed like squares of wheat there we were aimed and as we raced across bright knots of rail past standing pullmans walls of blackened moss came close and it was nearly done this frail travelling coincidence and what it held stood ready to be loosed with all the power that being changed can give we slowed again and as the tightened brakes took hold there swelled a sense of falling like an arrow-shower sent out of sight somewhere becoming rain
sometimes you know things once at a birthday party a little girl looked at her new party gloves and said she liked me making suddenly the light much brighter so that the very small hairs shone above her lip i felt stuffed like a swimming pool with words like i knew something that was in a great tangled knot and when we sat down i saw there were tiny glistenings on her legs too i knew something for sure then but it was too big or like the outside too everywhere or maybe hiding inside behind the bicycles where i later kissed her not using my tongue it was too giant and thin to squirm into and be so well inside of or too well hidden to punch and feel a few days later on the asphalt playground i tackled her she skinned her elbow and i even punched her and felt her felt how soft the hairs were i thought that i would make a fine football-playing poet but now i know it is better to be an old breathing man wrapped in a great coat in the stands who remains standing after each play who knows something who rotates in his place rasping over and over the thing he knows “ whydidnhe pass the other end was wide open the end was wide open the end was wide open ”
this was a true happening but as you will see shortly not such as would ready me for future ones what has brisk disaster to do with a leisurely ordeal neither event as you will notice also has made me an understanding man it was my watch one night away then on the sea when leaning on a couple of crates of something i dreamed of nothing special into the dark and whispered the smoke of a sugared native product into the dark then from behind a quick rush burst not six feet over me with a sawing and then a cracking sound and the other watch pointed up where a black squall ran port-side into the distance and a six by six crate lid veered and disappeared like a gull but the other time we were idle ashore for days somewhere there are sandy foothills and small plains with weeds that stand like birds and there was a steady blow on land that left off out at sea leaving us all peculiar if i remember the wind rasped the dense whorls of sharp leaves low on the ground and shrilled through the heads on the tall seed-stalks and all those days the sound rose until we without hope without breath bore the conviction that our sojourn had not begun and had no end like a period of dissipation in certain spanish havens the beggars come to you saying “ give me an amount god will make it good. ” had they been wise those ladies would have said something of that kind and proffered a gratifying smile to their junior treasurer the other tuesday and maybe been spared a peculiar fall for forgetting their cards or missing dues or due to rancor from a month of planning they were turned away from the luncheon which might have saved them through its regular plaudits and calls to order instead they turned immediately back after some while waiting with other members in vying groups where the sound rose and narrowed and from the dim hushed hall those five ladies my individual patrons came across the park together under a hefty sun under slight muffling rain to my teashop i worked on a cruising vessel one season and saw a woman being led below about a minute after she had vaulted the rail and now her face cluttered with casts of hair returned to me and a suggestion of the odor of moist wool then after ordering over the tinkle of service the ladies called me and began the question of a particular person none had touched wondering by turns in words like these “ maybe when he was a child he went alone one night along the lakeside or followed streams in the dark and mating mayflies swarmed him or he was caught by a swirl of slippery animals risen from rotted cresses it could be too a bird ’ s egg fell on him that red and yellow spattering his coat showed him the partial form of brain and bill and wings like candy arms. ” a second lady established the problem but in studious and in idle terms “ he must have tried becoming a sphere once when something hurt and must have failed he is a cylinder and lacking the perfected self-containment of the sphere he nonetheless has beauty and though incomplete is unassailable. ” the third advanced the first with this addition “ maybe when he was a child and a good half he planted a happy garden for himself and tried to bring a boyish girl inside to share his secrets he could not bestow. ” the fourth supposed some more years and less hope and figured on effects of disaffection “ perhaps it was a time sprouting potatoes came creeping like things of the undersea surrounding him that gave him the first fevered turn toward what we now call his fine beauty. ” the last lady came near to reconciling them “ some awareness certainly shook him unawares once and he flinched and flinching has made him beautiful to all of us who admire huge eyed skittishness the fawn standing some steps off always awkward and desired. ” odd gulls often join before a gale to bank and shrill in company then at the heavy time of it they hush and float broadcast those ladies did the same the other tuesday hopeless and breathless both i and they rode like sitting birds into a last lull and i was not as you have seen prepared by quick calamities of ocean labor for land bound suffering at ease understanding or unconcern could serve but pain and malice won and who may be forgiven even his shapeless victories “ the boy is never by himself ” i said “ but by him stands an unseen friend whose face came in the petal fall under a secret tree who meets his vague eyes with beaming gaps and his remote grin with a long lipless smile ”
comes the time when it ’ s later and onto your table the headwaiter puts the bill and very soon after rings out the sound of lively laughter— picking up change hands like a walrus and a face like a barndoor ’ s and a head without any apparent size nothing but two eyes— so that ’ s you man or me i make it as i can i pick up i go faster than they know— out the door the street like a night any night and no one in sight but then well there she is old friend liz— and she opens the door of her cadillac i step in back and we ’ re gone she turns me on— there are very huge stars man in the sky and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie with a gob of white white ice cream on top of it and i eat it— slowly and while certainly they are laughing at me and all around me is racket of these cats not making it i make it in my wicker basket
independence day 1964 on her 36th birthday thomas had shown her her first swimming pool it had been his favorite color exactly—just so much of it the swimmers ’ white arms jutting into the chevrons of high society she had rolled up her window and told him to drive on fast now this act of mercy four daughters dragging her to their husbands ’ company picnic white families on one side and them on the other unpacking the same squeeze bottles of heinz the same waxy beef patties and salem potato chip bags so he was dead for the first time on fourth of july—ten years ago had been harder waiting for something to happen and ten years before that the girls like young horses eyeing the track last august she stood alone for hours in front of the t.v set as a crow ’ s wing moved slowly through the white streets of government that brave swimming scared her like joanna saying mother we ’ re afro-americans now what did she know about africa were there lakes like this one with a rowboat pushed under the pier or thomas ’ great mississippi with its sullen silks there was the nile but the nile belonged to god where she came from was the past 12 miles into town where nobody had locked their back door and goodyear hadn ’ t begun to dream of a park under the company symbol a white foot sprouting two small wings
in the mud of a tire rut we were the filaments we said if mrs. agnew could make music on spiro ’ s flute we said the clubs in the hands of the chicago cops would liquefy the trees shook with the throb of steel what did we do to be so red white and blue we were inexorable like the dialectic unraveling from hanoi to the jacksonian grass we were the inebriates of vitamin c and cocaine the daughters of the gray flannel suit and when the shaman spread his yellow robe like the sun he was all teeth and amp and what were we
we would go down to the fish market early to cleanse our vision the fish were silver and scarlet and green and the color of sea the fish were lovelier than even the sea with its silvery scales we thought of return lovely too the women with jars on their heads olive-brown clay shaped softly like thighs we each thought of our women their voices their laughs the way they walked down the street and each of us laughed and it rained on the sea in vineyards that cling to cracks in the earth water softens the leaves and the grape-stems the sky is colored by occasional clouds that redden with pleasure and sun on earth flavors and smells in the sky color and we were alone there we thought of return the way a man thinks of morning after an utterly sleepless night we took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten of fruit all so alive in the musk of the sea we were drunk on the thought of impending return

he hooked to the body hard took it well and loved to fight had seven in a row and a small fleck over one eye and then he met a kid from camden with arms thin as wires— it was a good one the safe lions roared and threw money they were both up and down many times but he lost that one and he lost the rematch in which neither of them fought at all hanging on to each other like lovers through the boos and now he ’ s over at mike ’ s changing tires and oil and batteries the fleck over the eye still young but you don ’ t ask him you don ’ t ask him anything except maybe you think it ’ s going to rain or you think the sun ’ s gon na come out to which he ’ ll usually answer hell no but you ’ ll have your important tank of gas and drive off
some prowl sea-beds some hurtle to a star and mother some obsessed turn over every stone or open graves to let that starlight in there are men who would open anything harvey the circulation of the blood and freud the circulation of our dreams pried honourably and honoured are like all explorers men who ’ d open men and those others mother with diseases like great streets named after them addison parkinson hodgkin—physicians who ’ d arrive fast and first on any sour death-bed scene i am their slowcoach colleague half afraid incurious as a boy it was so you know how my small hand never teased to pieces an alarm clock or flensed a perished mouse and this larger hand ’ s the same it stretches now out from a white sleeve to hold up mother your x-ray to the glowing screen my eyes look but don ’ t want to i still don ’ t want to know
some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which to good men is an abomination our smith of late most wonderfully swore that whilst he breathed he would drink no more but since i know his meaning for i think he meant he would not breath whilst he did drink
just by the wooden brig a bird flew up frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down to reach the misty dewberry—let us stoop and seek its nest—the brook we need not dread 'tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown so it sings harmless o'er its pebbly bed —ay here it is stuck close beside the bank beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank its husk seeds tall and high—'tis rudely planned of bleachèd stubbles and the withered fare that last year 's harvest left upon the land lined thinly with the horse 's sable hair five eggs pen-scribbled o'er with ink their shells resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads as nature 's poesy and pastoral spells— they are the yellowhammer 's and she dwells most poet-like where brooks and flowery weeds as sweet as castaly to fancy seems and that old molehill like as parnass hill on which her partner haply sits and dreams o'er all her joys of song—so leave it still a happy home of sunshine flowers and streams yet in the sweetest places cometh ill a noisome weed that burthens every soil for snakes are known with chill and deadly coil to watch such nests and seize the helpless young and like as though the plague became a guest leaving a houseless home a ruined nest— and mournful hath the little warblers sung when such like woes hath rent its little breast
i ’ ve trod the links with many a man and played him club for club ’ tis scarce a year since i began and i am still a dub but this i ’ ve noticed as we strayed along the bunkered way no one with me has ever played as he did yesterday it makes no difference what the drive together as we walk till we up to the ball arrive i get the same old talk “ to-day there ’ s something wrong with me just what i can not say would you believe i got a three for this hole—yesterday ” i see them top and slice a shot and fail to follow through and with their brassies plough the lot the very way i do to six and seven their figures run and then they sadly say “ i neither dubbed nor foozled one when i played—yesterday ” i have no yesterdays to count no good work to recall each morning sees hope proudly mount each evening sees it fall and in the locker room at night when men discuss their play i hear them and i wish i might have seen them—yesterday oh dear old yesterday what store of joys for men you hold i ’ m sure there is no day that ’ s more remembered or extolled i ’ m off my task myself a bit my mind has run astray i think perhaps i should have writ these verses—yesterday
dear gary somehow your letter was no surprise and i think you knew that it was no surprise or you would have tried to break the news more gently somehow i think we understand what the other is going to say long before we say it—a proof of love and i think a protection against misunderstanding so i 've been expecting this letter for five weeks now—and i still do n't know how to answer it bohemia is a dreadful wonderful place it is full of hideous people and beautiful poetry it is a hell full of windows into heaven it would be wrong of me to drag a person i love into such a place against his will unless you walk into it freely and with open despairing eyes you ca n't even see the windows and yet i ca n't leave bohemia myself to come to you—bohemia is inside of me in a sense is me was the price i paid the oath i signed to write poetry i think that someday you 'll enter bohemia—not for me i 'm not worth the price no human being is but for poetry—to see the windows and maybe blast a few yourself through the rocks of hell i 'll be there waiting for you my arms open to receive you but let 's have these letters go on whether it be days years or never before i see you we can still love each other although we can not see each other we will be no farther apart when i 'm in berkeley than we were when i was in minneapolis and we can continue to love each other by letter from alien worlds love jack c.1951-2

for allison hogge in memory of brian wilkie i was a math major—fond of all things rational it was the first day of my first poetry class the prof with the air of a priest at latin mass told us that we could “ make great poetry personal ” could own it since poetry we memorize sings inside us always by way of illustration he began reciting shelley with real passion but stopped at “ ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair ” — because with that last plosive his top denture popped from his mouth and bounced off an empty chair he blinked then offered as postscript to his lecture a promise so splendid it made me give up math “ more thingth like that will happen in thith clath ”
we the research assistants and teaching assistants of the university of california wish to register our protest against the new loyalty oath for the following reasons 1 the testing of a university faculty by oath is a stupid and insulting procedure if this oath is to have the effect of eliminating communists from the faculty we might as logically eliminate murderers from the faculty by forcing every faculty member to sign an oath saying that he has never committed murder 2 that such an oath is more dangerous to the liberties of the community than any number of active communists should be obvious to any student of history liberty and democracy are more often overthrown by fear than by stealth only countries such as russia or spain have institutions so weak and unhealthy that they must be protected by terror 3 oaths and other forms of blackmail are destructive to the free working of man 's intellect since the early middle ages universities have zealously guarded their intellectual freedom and have made use of its power to help create the world we know today the oath that galileo was forced by the inquisition to swear is but a distant cousin to the oath we are asked to swear today but both represent the struggle of the blind and powerful against the minds of free men we who will inherit the branches of learning that one thousand years of free universities have helped to generate are not communists and dislike the oath for the same reason we dislike communism both breed stupidity and indignity both threaten our personal and intellectual freedom c. 1949

this fastening unfastening and heaving— this is our life whose life is it improving it topples some some others it will toughen work is the safest way to fail and often the simplest way to love a son or daughter we come we carp we ’ re fired we worry later that man is strange his calipers are shiny his hands are black for lunch he brings baloney and offered coffee answers “ thank you no. ” that man with nothing evil left to do and two small skills to stir some interest up fits in the curtained corner of a shop the best part of our life is disappearing into the john to sneak a smoke or staring at screaming non-stop mills our eyes unfocused or standing judging whose sick joke is sickest yet nothing you could do could break our silence we are a check do not expect a balance that is a wrathful man becoming older a nobody like us turned mortgage holder we stay until the bell that man will stay ten minutes more so no one can complain each day by then he ’ s done exactly ten ten what exactly no one here can say

come see the woodpile behind the cannery come through the wall to where the wood was chopped and the difficult wood was hewed there is a short history of commotion here where a sudden bonfire spat its surprise at the sky— a hundred feet or more the shavings swept through disturbed air and made their own music the music hands make such a yellow crackle and such a thrashing in the morning come wait for the heavy trucks to arrive the men in dusters cutting the twine loading the long ghostly planks like ballast into iron barges this will be packing for a transatlantic box or paper for essays on schadenfreude or timber for dollhouse dressers or a twenty baht note for the thai rubber trade these matchsticks will burn whenever you strike them and this hack at it however you like is nothing more than deadwood for the fire come see—now even the men are doing only what they were made to do

after ernesto trejo and the morning ’ s marine layer cloud cover ’ s just beginning to unhinge to let the buttery light of another daybreak slip through and weigh down the dead lawns and sagging rooftops of this neighborhood where cold war era television antennas still cast shadows like b-52s heading offshore where poverty this early is the smell of malt-o-meal and the dregs of thin beer washed down the sink where the shift begins at 7am but consciousness has a way of coming round as slowly as this old computer monitor flickers its dull sixteen colors into being on it the names and numbers of laundromat and liquor store owners fast food managers and lawn care companies it ’ s my job to cold call them read from a script on the benefits of membership in the executive dining club not take no for an answer i ’ m no good and both the boss and i know it and he ’ s hovering when the scraped-out voice of the woman on my phone answers me with my husband ’ s been killed and then instead of hanging up throws the receiver down next to something — dishwasher or window ac i don ’ t know — but something close it sounds to tearing itself apart something cycling through an awful screeching noise and it ’ s because i ’ ve paused that the boss flings a pencil into the wall in front of me and edges closer and because of the fear of unemployment forms or the sky opening up if i were to walk out and because this sound — the un-oiled flak-fouled crack of it — has left me standing suddenly at the end of a runway planes screaming low overhead and loaded for the beginning of the end of the world that i start back into the script start back as if i believe each word even though in the rattle and dust of the jet-wash no one hears a thing

you 're dreaming of cratoids armpullers the blownose dragon who knows what anna brichtova dreamed about the girl who comes looking for us tonight with her mosaic of colored paper her house with its red roof some trees on a green lawn the sky—outside the concentration camp this is the real gift i brought back from prague without telling you it was with me on the train the morning i thought i was living in hell stuttgart or south of there amid a drone of people working—they do n't know at what or for whom but they 're working pressing keys sending messages to unknown persons through the air nothing but eyes and fingers nothing but one day after the next interminable passage of a time that does n't vary that belongs forever to others to something outside themselves and the fear the hatred of one pariah for another this brawl of lost souls of new slaves the great drinker of beer the woman staring into space mazinger z these were my traveling companions who knows what anna brichtova dreamed about or what you 're dreaming now or how you children see the world will you find among your games the game that saves us it 's what we all are hoping as we watch you sleep
oysters adhere to things no eyes spat on the smooth curve of a pier they feel shadows and snap shut the sun wavers while anchored below each distills tomales bay accreting waves within its shell voluptuous and cold kumamoto trembles on a thin fork liquefaction of cloud rain distorts glass our tavern submerged all afternoon
a blast off the atlantic snaps a flag in the firth of clyde while thirty leagues away the same synoptic wind surges across this hillside honeycombed with mineshafts sounding the unstopped slots of a `` g '' harmonica left to dry on the kitchen sill snow charges a sky in which the sun swims and glimmers like a groat a turbulent space where owls hunt by day but nothing stands for long—bereft of circumstance—beyond the standing stones of long meg and her daughters through the night like a stoker on a fast express—the hyperion on its edinburgh run— you hoy buckets of coal on the grate only to see its flames drawn up the chimney getting more heat from hoying the fuel than from its burning as a barnacle goose swims against the dark uttering its terse honk you pull your favorite word duvet close about your head tomorrow bailiffs may take everything not hammered down
not that anyone will care but as i was sitting there on the 8:07 to new haven i was struck by lightning the strangest thing was n't the flash of my hair catching on fire but the way people pretended nothing had happened for me it was real enough but it seemed as if the others saw this as nothing but a way of happening a way to get from one place to another place but not a place itself so ignored i burned to death later someone sat in my seat and my ashes ruined his suit

canto iii appeared in the july 1917 issue of poetry originally part of what scholars call the `` ur-cantos '' this version of canto iii was later edited by pound to become canto i of his collected cantos the section that eventually became canto i is highlighted in blue in the poem below —the editors iii another 's a half-cracked fellow—john heydon worker of miracles dealer in levitation in thoughts upon pure form in alchemy seer of pretty visions `` servant of god and secretary of nature '' full of plaintive charm like botticelli 's with half-transparent forms lacking the vigor of gods thus heydon in a trance at bulverton had such a sight decked all in green with sleeves of yellow silk slit to the elbow slashed with various purples her eyes were green as glass her foot was leaf-like she was adorned with choicest emeralds and promised him the way of holy wisdom `` pretty green bank '' began the half-lost poem take the old way say i met john heydon sought out the place lay on the bank was `` plungèd deep in swevyn '' and saw the company—layamon chaucer— pass each in his appropriate robes conversed with each observed the varying fashion and then comes heydon `` i have seen john heydon '' let us hear john heydon `` omniformis omnis intellectus est '' —thus he begins by spouting half of psellus then comes a note my assiduous commentator not psellus de daemonibus but porphyry 's chances in the thirteenth chapter that `` every intellect is omni-form '' magnifico lorenzo used the dodge says that he met ficino in some wordsworthian false-pastoral manner and that they walked along stopped at a well-head and heard deep platitudes about contentment from some old codger with an endless beard `` a daemon is not a particular intellect but is a substance differed from intellect '' breaks in ficino '' placed in the latitude or locus of souls '' — that 's out of proclus take your pick of them valla more earth and sounder rhetoric— prefacing praise to his pope nicholas '' a man of parts skilled in the subtlest sciences a patron of the arts of poetry and of a fine discernment '' then comes a catalogue his jewels of conversation no you 've not read your elegantiae— a dull book —shook the church the prefaces cut clear and hard '' know then the roman speech a sacrament '' spread for the nations eucharist of wisdom bread of the liberal arts ha sir blancatz sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes valla the heart of rome sustaining speech set out before the people `` nec bonus christianus ac bonus tullianus '' marius du bellay wept for the buildings baldassar castiglione saw raphael '' lead back the soul into its dead waste dwelling '' corpore laniato and lorenzo valla '' broken in middle life bent to submission — took a fat living from the papacy '' that 's in villari but burckhardt 's statement is different — '' more than the roman city the roman speech '' holds fast its part among the ever-living `` not by the eagles only was rome measured '' `` wherever the roman speech was there was rome '' wherever the speech crept there was mastery spoke with the law 's voice while your greek logicians ... more greeks than one doughty 's `` divine homeros '' came before sophistry justinopolitan uncatalogued andreas divus gave him in latin 1538 in my edition the rest uncertain caught up his cadence word and syllable '' down to the ships we went set mast and sail black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice weeping we went '' i 've strained my ear for -ensa -ombra and -ensa and cracked my wit on delicate canzoni— here 's but rough meaning '' and then went down to the ship set keel to breakers forth on the godly sea we set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship sheep bore we aboard her and our bodies also heavy with weeping and winds from sternward bore us out onward with bellying canvas— circe 's this craft the trim-coifed goddess then sat we amidships wind jamming the tiller thus with stretched sail we went over sea till day 's end sun to his slumber shadows o'er all the ocean came we then to the bounds of deepest water to the kimmerian lands and peopled cities covered with close-webbed mist unpiercèd ever with glitter of sun-rays nor with stars stretched nor looking back from heaven swartest night stretched over wretched men there thither we in that ship unladed sheep there the ocean flowing backward came we through to the place aforesaid by circe here did they rites perimedes and eurylochus and drawing sword from my hip i dug the ell-square pitkin poured we libations unto each the dead first mead and then sweet wine water mixed with white flour then prayed i many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads as set in ithaca sterile bulls of the best for sacrifice heaping the pyre with goods sheep to tiresias only black and a bell sheep dark blood flowed in the fosse souls out of erebus cadaverous dead of brides of youths and of many passing old virgins tender souls stained with recent tears many men mauled with bronze lance-heads battle spoil bearing yet dreary arms these many crowded about me with shouting pallor upon me cried to my men for more beasts slaughtered the herds—sheep slain of bronze poured ointment cried to the gods to pluto the strong and praised proserpine unsheathed the narrow steel i sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead till i should hear tiresias but first elpenor came our friend elpenor unburied cast on the wide earth— limbs that we left in the house of circe unwept unwrapped in sepulchre since toils urged other pitiful spirit—and i cried in hurried speech 'elpenor how art thou come to this dark coast cam'st thou afoot outstripping seamen and he in heavy speech 'ill fate and abundant wine i slept in circe 's ingle going down the long ladder unguarded i fell against the buttress shattered the nape-nerve the soul sought avernus but thou o king i bid remember me unwept unburied heap up mine arms be tomb by the sea-board and inscribed a man of no fortune and with a name to come and set my oar up that i swung 'mid fellows came then another ghost whom i beat off anticlea and then tiresias theban holding his golden wand knew me and spoke first 'man of ill hour why come a second time leaving the sunlight facing the sunless dead and this joyless region stand from the fosse move back leave me my bloody bever and i will speak you true speeches `` and i stepped back sheathing the yellow sword dark blood he drank then and spoke 'lustrous odysseus shalt return through spiteful neptune over dark seas lose all companions foretold me the ways and the signs came then anticlea to whom i answered 'fate drives me on through these deeps i sought tiresias i told her news of troy and thrice her shadow faded in my embrace then had i news of

has its little hobbies the lung likes its air best after supper goes deeper there to trade up for oxygen give everything else away and before supper yes during too but there ’ s something about evening that slow breath of the day noticed oh good still coming still going ... as for bones—femur spine the tribe of them in there—they harden with use the body would like a small mile or two thank you it would like it on a bike or a run or in the water blue and food a habit that involves a larger circumference where a garden ’ s involved beer is brewed cows wake the farmer with their fullness a field surrenders its wheat and wheat understands i will be crushed into flour and starry-dust the whole room the baker sweating opening a window to acknowledge such remarkable confetti and the brain locked in its strange dual citizenship idles there in the body neatly terraced and landscaped or left to ruin such a brain wild roses growing next to the sea the body is gracious about that oh their scent sometimes their tangle in truth in secret the first thing in morning the eye longs to see
it seems to head from its last stop too fast my transbay train ’ s strungout hoo deep inside the tunnel and starts to bleed into the baritone wail of that guy at platform ’ s end a sort of lullaby rubbed against the wall then caught in a squall of wind darkening toward us his whippy voice skinning its tired song off the tiled dome he ’ s determined the silky lyric says to be independently blue while we all wait to be chuted to car lot or home closer to love or farther and sooner to loss our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed every plural presence now some thing alone thanks to our singer-man we wait for the train patient with hope a hope that ’ s like complaint

when the fog slunk in with that salivary close coyote panting its hue a very huelessness like breath huffed on a glass like the void stretched and still stretching past where we ’ d thought it could we felt less wary we felt our shoulders loosen surrendering to phantom hands and softly vanished feet the sensation was a first and last sweet to feel the vigilance at last suspending the chronic stress of constantly pretending to know—have known —what all the others knew loopy sly we leered at one another what we just assumed was one another and did the things we weren ’ t supposed to do grinning as if seated in the back pew of a church that worshipped fuss and bother a dour church where facial expression of any kind had been prohibited and where the chinking hefty plate we shifted hand to hand held such a vast collection of their coin we pocketed a fraction for when the fog would lift if it lifted but stealing from them puts you in their power since then we have been paying for that hour
we lived in the lucky world— not the far place where flies sipped at eye corners of children too weak to cry a camera showed that world to us on posters but we were children we wanted most to not be those others with their terrible bones we spoke of them wide-eyed with what we thought was tenderness but our words came in a different register as if to speak of such betrayal by the grown world could bring a harm of great immensity upon us too we got to choose from the cupboard we gave what we hated—beets peas mushrooms our dreams were not of rice the moon laid light on our bicycles propped against the porch sycamores became our giants standing guard the overgrown shrub our fort we thought we understood what was required even crouched beneath our desks during drill we said one prayer for the fear one for recess mcclellan air force base sent forth big-bellied planes that rattled the windows of our houses evenings we took to the streets shrieking with joy rode madly fast around the block we collapsed on the lawn breathless the earth cool beneath us pounding hard as if it had one great heart as if it was ours
sometimes i dream what ’ s called the male dream i ’ m going somewhere not too far away i ’ m almost there when there ’ s a slight delay—a minor detour of no consequence but then another and another as i get farther and farther away from my initial destination which becomes inaccessible before i left berlin i went to venice a city that reminds me of that dream however close you are to where you want to go the compound turnings of its narrow passageways and alleys carry you relentlessly away until you dead-end at a small canal that ’ s nowhere on your map the late wrecked century that started in berlin where all roads lead— i thought i ’ d find if not the truth exactly then at least an inkling of some fantasy that lay beneath the placid surface of the day the remnants of some dream so many people had to die for instead i watched the boats go by and clouds traverse the sky above an unreal city floating on the water we ’ re sure at first that something lies beyond the facts and books but then we realize it isn ’ t there whatever lay behind the slaughter wasn ’ t in the world existing merely in the heart in memory in someone ’ s imagination places harboring nothing real to try to see it is to watch it disappear stranding you a life away from where the unimaginable began staring blankly at your own face floating in the water

love and recompense the boon with mine if dewy morn and odorous noon and even with sunset and its gorgeous ministers and solemn midnight 's tingling silentness if autumn 's hollow sighs in the sere wood and winter robing with pure snow and crowns of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs if spring 's voluptuous pantings when she breathes her first sweet kisses have been dear to me if no

mother of this unfathomable world favour my solemn song for i have loved thee ever and thee only i have watched thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine by forcing some

life on some dark hope have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses made such magic as compels the charmèd night to render up thy charge ... and though ne'er yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary enough from incommunicable dream and twilight phantasms and deep noon-day thought has shone within me that serenely now and moveless as a long-forgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane i wait thy breath great parent that my strain may modulate with murmurs of the air and motions of the forests and the sea and voice of living beings and woven hymns of night and day and the deep heart of man there was a poet whose untimely tomb no human hands with pious reverence reared but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness — a lovely youth —no mourning maiden decked with weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath the lone couch of his everlasting sleep — gentle and brave and generous —no lorn bard breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh he lived he died he sung in solitude strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes and virgins as unknown he passed have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn and silence too enamoured of that voice locks its mute music in her rugged cell by solemn vision and bright silver dream his infancy was nurtured every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air sent to his heart its choicest impulses the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips and all of great or good or lovely which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates he felt and knew when early youth had past he left his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes from savage men his rest and food nature 's most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued where'er the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke or where bitumen lakes on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge or where the secret caves rugged and dark winding among the springs of fire and poison inaccessible to avarice or pride their starry domes of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls frequent with crystal column and clear shrines of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite nor had that scene of ampler majesty than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder he would linger long in lonesome vales making the wild his home until the doves and squirrels would partake from his innocuous hand his bloodless food lured by the gentle meaning of his looks and the wild antelope that starts whene'er the dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own his wandering step obedient to high thoughts has visited the awful ruins of the days of old athens and tyre and balbec and the waste where stood jerusalem the fallen towers of babylon the eternal pyramids memphis and thebes and whatsoe'er of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx dark æthiopia in her desert hills conceals among the ruined temples there stupendous columns and wild images of more than man where marble daemons watch the zodiac 's brazen mystery and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around he lingered poring on memorials of the world 's youth through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task but ever gazed and gazed till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food her daily portion from her father 's tent and spread her matting for his couch and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps — enamoured yet not daring for deep awe to speak her love —and watched his nightly sleep sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips parted in slumber whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose then when red morn made paler the pale moon to her cold home wildered and wan and panting she returned the poet wandering on through arabie and persia and the wild carmanian waste and o'er the aërial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves in joy and exultation held his way till in the vale of cashmire far within its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs a vision on his sleep there came a dream of hopes that never yet had flushed his cheek he dreamed a veilèd maid sate near him talking in low solemn tones her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought its music long like woven sounds of streams and breezes held his inmost sense suspended in its web of many-coloured woof and shifting hues knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme and lofty hopes of divine liberty thoughts the most dear to him and poesy herself a poet soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire wild numbers then she raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos her fair hands were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music and her breath tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song sudden she rose as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen at the sound he turned and saw by the warm light of their own life her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind her outspread arms now bare her dark locks floating in the breath of night her beamy bending eyes her parted lips outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath and spread his arms to meet her panting bosom ... she drew back a while then yielding to the irresistible joy with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night involved and swallowed up the vision sleep like a dark flood suspended in its course rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain roused by the shock he started from his trance— the cold white light of morning the blue moon low in the west the clear and garish hills the distinct valley and the vacant woods spread round him where he stood whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight the sounds that soothed his sleep the mystery and the majesty of earth the joy the exultation his wan eyes gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as ocean 's moon looks on the moon in heaven the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts he eagerly pursues beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade he overleaps the bounds alas alas were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously lost lost for ever lost in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep that beautiful shape does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise o sleep does the bright arch of rainbow clouds and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake lead only to a black and watery depth while death 's blue vault with loathliest vapours hung where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day conduct o sleep to thy delightful realms this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair while daylight held the sky the poet kept mute conference with his still soul at night the passion came like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream and shook him from his rest and led him forth into the darkness.—as an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent feels her breast burn with the poison and precipitates through night and day tempest and calm and cloud frantic with dizzying anguish her blind flight o'er the wide aëry wilderness thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream beneath the cold glare of the desolate night through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells startling with careless step the moonlight snake he fled red morning dawned upon his flight shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death he wandered on till vast aornos seen from petra 's steep hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud through balk and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust wildly he wandered on day after day a weary waste of hours bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame and now his limbs were lean his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin life and the lustre that consumed it shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone the cottagers who ministered with human charity his human wants beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant the mountaineer encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes and eager breath and feet disturbing not the drifted snow had paused in its career the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mother 's robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes to remember their strange light in many a dream of after-times but youthful maidens taught by nature would interpret half the woe that wasted him would call him with false names brother and friend would press his pallid hand at parting and watch dim through tears the path of his departure from their father 's door at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes a strong impulse urged his steps to the sea-shore a swan was there beside a sluggish stream among the reeds it rose as he approached and with strong wings scaling the upward sky bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main his eyes pursued its flight.— '' thou hast a home beautiful bird thou voyagest to thine home where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy and what am i that i should linger here with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes spirit more vast than thine frame more attuned to beauty wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air to the blind earth and heaven that echoes not my thoughts '' a gloomy smile of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips for sleep he knew kept most relentlessly its precious charge and silent death exposed faithless perhaps as sleep a shadowy lure with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms startled by his own thoughts he looked around there was no fair fiend near him not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze it had been long abandoned for its sides gaped wide with many a rift and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear ocean 's waste for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep the day was fair and sunny sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance and the wind swept strongly from the shore blackening the waves following his eager soul the wanderer leaped in the boat he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast and took his lonely seat and felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boat.—a whirlwind swept it on with fierce gusts and precipitating force through the white ridges of the chafèd sea the waves arose higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest 's scourge like serpents struggling in a vulture 's grasp calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave and blast on blast descending and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course he sate as if their genii were the ministers appointed to conduct him to the light of those belovèd eyes the poet sate holding the steady helm evening came on the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray that canopied his path o'er the waste deep twilight ascending slowly from the east entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks o'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day night followed clad with stars on every side more horribly the multitudinous streams of ocean 's mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering as to mock the calm and spangled sky the little boat still fled before the storm still fled like foam down the steep cataract of a wintry river now pausing on the edge of the riven wave now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell convulsing ocean safely fled— as if that frail and wasted human form had been an elemental god at midnight the moon arose and lo the ethereal cliffs of caucasus whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound for ever.—who shall save — the boat fled on —the boiling torrent drove — the crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms the shattered mountain overhung the sea and faster still beyond all human speed suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave the little boat was driven a cavern there yawned and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea the boat fled on with unrelaxing speed.— '' vision and love '' the poet cried aloud `` i have beheld the path of thy departure sleep and death shall not divide us long '' the boat pursued the windings of the cavern daylight shone at length upon that gloomy river 's flow now where the fiercest war among the waves is calm on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly where the mountain riven exposed those black depths to the azure sky ere yet the flood 's enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus with sound that shook the everlasting rocks the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm stair above stair the eddying waters rose circling immeasurably fast and laved with alternating dash the gnarlèd roots of mighty trees that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it i the midst was left reflecting yet distorting every cloud a pool of treacherous and tremendous calm seized by the sway of the ascending stream with dizzy swiftness round and round and round ridge after ridge the straining boat arose till on the verge of the extremest curve where through an opening of the rocky bank the waters overflow and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides is left the boat paused shuddering.—shall it sink down the abyss shall the reverting stress of that resistless gulf embosom it now shall it fall —a wandering stream of wind breathed from the west has caught the expanded sail and lo with gentle motion between banks of mossy slope and on a placid stream beneath a woven grove it sails and hark the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods where the embowering trees recede and leave a little space of green expanse the cove is closed by meeting banks whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes reflected in the crystal calm the wave of the boat 's motion marred their pensive task which nought but vagrant bird or wanton wind or falling spear-grass or their own decay had e'er disturbed before the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair but on his heart its solitude returned and he forbore not the strong impulse hid in those flushed cheeks bent eyes and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry it hung upon his life as lightning in a cloud gleams hovering ere it vanish ere the floods of night close over it the noonday sun now shone upon the forest one vast mass of mingling shade whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms there huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks mocking its moans respond and roar for ever the meeting boughs and implicated leaves wove twilight o'er the poet 's path as led by love or dream or god or mightier death he sought in nature 's dearest haunt some bank her cradle and his sepulchre more dark and dark the shades accumulate the oak expanding its immense and knotty arms embraces the light beech the pyramids of the tall cedar overarching frame most solemn domes within and far below like clouds suspended in an emerald sky the ash and the acacia floating hang tremulous and pale like restless serpents clothed in rainbow and in fire the parasites starred with ten thousand blossoms flow around the grey trunks and as gamesome infants eyes with gentle meanings and most innocent wiles fold their beams round the hearts of those that love these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union the woven leaves make net-work of the dark blue light of day and the night 's noontide clearness mutable as shapes in the weird clouds soft mossy lawns beneath these canopies extend their swells fragrant with perfumed herbs and eyed with blooms minute yet beautiful one darkest glen sends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine a soul-dissolving odour to invite to some more lovely mystery through the dell silence and twilight here twin-sisters keep their noonday watch and sail among the shades like vaporous shapes half seen beyond a well dark gleaming and of most translucent wave images all the woven boughs above and each depending leaf and every speck of azure sky darting between their chasms nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair or painted bird sleeping beneath the moon or gorgeous insect floating motionless unconscious of the day ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon hither the poet came his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain as the human heart gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave sees its own treacherous likeness there he heard the motion of the leaves the grass that sprung startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose a spirit seemed to stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes of shadowy silver or enshrining light borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace or majesty or mystery — but undulating woods and silent well and leaping rivulet and evening gloom now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming held commune with him as if he and it were all that was —only ... when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness ... two eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him obedient to the light that shone within his soul he went pursuing the windings of the dell.—the rivulet wanton and wild through many a green ravine beneath the forest flowed sometimes it fell among the moss with hollow harmony dark and profound now on the polished stones it danced like childhood laughing as it went then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietness.— '' o stream whose source is inaccessibly profound whither do thy mysterious waters tend thou imagest my life thy darksome stillness thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs thy searchless fountain and invisible course have each their type in me and the wide sky and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud contains thy waters as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i the passing wind '' beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went he did impress on the green moss his tremulous step that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever he did move yet not like him forgetful of the grave where when the flame of his frail exultation shall be spent he must descend with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet and now the forest 's solemn canopies were changed for the uniform and lightsome evening sky grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed the struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope and nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil a gradual change was here yet ghastly for as fast years flow away the smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin and white and where irradiate dewy eyes had shone gleam stony orbs —so from his steps bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade of the green groves with all their odorous winds and musical motions calm he still pursued the stream that with a larger volume now rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed on every side now rose rocks which in unimaginable forms lifted their black and barren pinnacles in the light of evening and its precipice obscuring the ravine disclosed above mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream lo where the pass expands its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks and seems with its accumulated crags to overhang the world for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom of leaden-coloured even and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight on the verge of the remote horizon the near scene in naked and severe simplicity made contrast with the universe a pine rock-rooted stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast yielding one only response at each pause in most familiar cadence with the howl the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path fell into that immeasurable void scattering its waters to the passing winds yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent were not all —one silent nook was there even on the edge of that vast mountain upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks it overlooked in its serenity the dark earth and the bending vault of stars it was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms and did embower with leaves for ever green and berries dark the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore in wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay red yellow or ethereally pale rivals the pride of summer 't is the haunt of every gentle wind whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity one step one human step alone has ever broken the stillness of its solitude —one voice alone inspired its echoes —even that voice which hither came floating among the winds and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued its motions render up its majesty scatter its music on the unfeeling storm and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss commit the colours of that varying cheek that snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes the dim and hornèd moon hung low and poured a sea of lustre on the horizon 's verge that overflowed its mountains yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank wan moonlight even to fulness not a star shone not a sound was heard the very winds danger 's grim playmates on that precipice slept clasped in his embrace.—o storm of death whose sightless speed divides this sullen night and thou colossal skeleton that still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence art king of this frail world from the red field of slaughter from the reeking hospital the patriot 's sacred couch the snowy bed of innocence the scaffold and the throne a mighty voice invokes thee ruin calls his brother death a rare and regal prey he hath prepared prowling around the world glutted with which thou mayst repose and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart when on the threshold of the green recess the wanderer 's footsteps fell he knew that death was on him yet a little ere it fled did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past that paused within his passive being now like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head his limbs did rest diffused and motionless on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasm —and thus he lay surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life hope and despair the torturers slept no mortal pain or fear marred his repose the influxes of sense and his own being unalloyed by pain yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed the stream of thought till he lay breathing there at peace and faintly smiling —his last sight was the great moon which o'er the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle now upon the jaggèd hills it rests and still as the divided frame of the vast meteor sunk the poet 's blood that ever beat in mystic sympathy with nature 's ebb and flow grew feebler still and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate night —till the minutest ray was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart it paused—it fluttered but when heaven remained utterly black the murky shades involved an image silent cold and motionless as their own voiceless earth and vacant air even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight ere the west eclipses it was now that wondrous frame— no sense no motion no divinity— a fragile lute on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wander—a bright stream once fed with many-voicèd waves—a dream of youth which night and time have quenched for ever still dark and dry and unremembered now o for medea 's wondrous alchemy which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance o that god profuse of poisons would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained who now vessel of deathless wrath a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears over the world wanders for ever lone as incarnate death o that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay were the true law of this so lovely world but thou art fled like some frail exhalation which the dawn robes in its golden beams —ah thou hast fled the brave the gentle and the beautiful the child of grace and genius heartless things are done and said i the world and many worms and beasts and men live on and mighty earth from sea and mountain city and wilderness in vesper low or joyous orison lifts still its solemn voice —but thou art fled— thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene who have to thee been purest ministers who are alas now thou art not upon those pallid lips so sweet even in their silence on those eyes that image sleep in death upon that form yet safe from the worm 's outrage let no tear be shed—not even in thought nor when those hues are gone and those divinest lineaments worn by the senseless wind shall live alone in the frail pauses of this simple strain let not high verse mourning the memory of that which is no more or painting 's woe or sculpture speak in feeble imagery their own cold powers art and eloquence and all the shows o the world are frail and vain to weep a loss that turns their lights to shade it is a woe too `` deep for tears '' when all is reft at once when some surpassing spirit whose light adorned the world around it leaves those who remain behind not sobs or groans the passionate tumult of a clinging hope but pale despair and cold tranquillity nature 's vast frame the web of human things birth and the grave that are not as they were
then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud says that america is for him a maximum-security prison whose walls are made of radioshacks and burger kings and mtv episodes where you can ’ t tell the show from the commercials and as i consider how to express how full of shit i think he is he says that even when he ’ s driving to the mall in his isuzu trooper with a gang of his friends letting rap music pour over them like a boiling jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers even then he feels buried alive captured and suffocated in the folds of the thick satin quilt of america and i wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade and then i remember that when i stabbed my father in the dream last night it was not blood but money that gushed out of him bright green hundred-dollar bills spilling from his wounds and—this is the weird part— he gasped “ thank god—those ben franklins were clogging up my heart— and so i perish happily freed from that which kept me from my liberty ” — which was when i knew it was a dream since my dad would never speak in rhymed couplets and i look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes and i think “ i am asleep in america too and i don ’ t know how to wake myself either ” and i remember what marx said near the end of his life “ i was listening to the cries of the past when i should have been listening to the cries of the future. ” but how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable or what kind of nightmare it might be when each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you and you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river even while others are drowning underneath you and you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters and yet it seems to be your own hand which turns the volume higher

like as a huntsman after weary chase seeing the game from him escap 'd away sits down to rest him in some shady place with panting hounds beguiled of their prey so after long pursuit and vain assay when i all weary had the chase forsook the gentle deer return 'd the self-same way thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook there she beholding me with milder look sought not to fly but fearless still did bide till i in hand her yet half trembling took and with her own goodwill her firmly tied strange thing me seem 'd to see a beast so wild so goodly won with her own will beguil 'd
i am in rome vatican bells tolling a windowful of god and bernini my neighbor the pope has died and god overnight has wept black mantles over the sainted stone age whose skirted shadows flit through to the main cave i nurse a cold it must be error to sniffle in sight of holiness “ liquids ” the doctor said he has no cure but since i have my choice i sip champagne if i must sit dropsical to heaven let me at least be ritual to a living water in the crypt under the cave the stone box in its stone row has been marked for months now my neighbor knew where he was going i half suspect i too know and that it is nothing to sneeze at but am left to sneeze i drink my ritual moët et chandon and wish my taste being misformed for the high authentic i had a california—a korbel or an almaden i like it “ forward ” as clerics of such matters say not schooled to greatness it is loud in heaven today and in the great stone school my neighbor kept the alumni procession of saints is forming for him bells clobber the air with portents i sniffle and sneeze wad kleenex and sip champagne trying to imagine what it might be to take part in a greatness or even in the illusion of something like the experience might deepen my character though i am already near the bottom of it among wads and butts of what was once idea and the last swallow i do not like the after-taste if that is what i am tasting but this is ritual i toast my neighbor may he find his glass and may its after-taste be all that he was schooled to

i shot an arrow into the air it fell to earth i knew not where for so swiftly it flew the sight could not follow it in its flight i breathed a song into the air it fell to earth i knew not where for who has sight so keen and strong that it can follow the flight of song long long afterward in an oak i found the arrow still unbroke and the song from beginning to end i found again in the heart of a friend

had i but lived a hundred years ago i might have gone as i have gone this year by warmwell cross on to a cove i know and time have placed his finger on me there '' you see that man '' — i might have looked and said '' o yes i see him one that boat has brought which dropped down channel round saint alban 's head so commonplace a youth calls not my thought '' `` you see that man '' — `` why yes i told you yes of an idling town-sort thin hair brown in hue and as the evening light scants less and less he looks up at a star as many do '' `` you see that man '' — `` nay leave me '' then i plead '' i have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea and it grows dark and i am weary-kneed i have said the third time yes that man i see '' `` good that man goes to rome — to death despair and no one notes him now but you and i a hundred years and the world will follow him there and bend with reverence where his ashes lie ''
to my daughter 1954 this is the terminal the light gives perfect vision false and hard the metal glitters deep and bright great planes are waiting in the yard— they are already in the night and you are here beside me small contained and fragile and intent on things that i but half recall— yet going whither you are bent i am the past and that is all but you and i in part are one the frightened brain the nervous will the knowledge of what must be done the passion to acquire the skill to face that which you dare not shun the rain of matter upon sense destroys me momently the score there comes what will come the expense is what one thought and something more— one ’ s being and intelligence this is the terminal the break beyond this point on lines of air you take the way that you must take and i remain in light and stare— in light and nothing else awake

he that had come that morning one after the other over seven hills each of a new color came now by the last tree by the red-colored valley to a gray river wide as the sea there at the shingle a listing wherry awash with dark water what should it carry there on the shelving three dark gentlemen might they direct him three gentlemen “ cable friend john john cable ” when they saw him they said “ come and be company as far as the far side. ” “ come follow the feet ” they said “ of your family of your old father that came already this way. ” but cable said “ first i must go once to my sister again what will she do come spring and no man on her garden she will say ‘ weeds are alive from here to the stream of friday i grieve for my brother ’ s plowing ’ then break and cry. ” “ lose no sleep ” they said “ for that fallow she will say before summer ‘ i can get me a daylong man do better than a brother. ’ ” cable said “ i think of my wife dearly she needs consoling i must go back for a little for fear she die of grieving. ” “ cable ” they said “ john cable ask no such wild favor still if you fear she die soon the boat might wait for her. ” but cable said “ i remember out of charity let me go shore up my poorly mother cries all afternoon. ” they said “ she is old and far far and rheumy with years and if you like we shall take no note of her tears. ” but cable said “ i am neither your hired man nor maid your dog nor shadow nor your ape to be led. ” he said “ i must go back once i heard someone say that the hollow stream of friday is a rank place to lie and this word now i remember makes me sorry have you thought of my own body i was always good to the frame that was my devotion and my blessing was the straight bole whose limbs were long as stories— now poor thing left in the dirt by the stream of friday might not remember me half tenderly. ” they let him nurse no worry they said “ we give you our word poor thing is made of patience will not say a word. ” “ cable friend john john cable ” after this they said “ come with no company to the far side to a populous place a dense city that shall not be changed before much sorrow dry. ” over shaking water toward the feet of his father leaving the hills ’ color and his poorly mother and his wife at grieving and his sister ’ s fallow and his body lying in the rank hollow now cable is carried on the dark river nor even a shadow followed him over on the wide river gray as the sea flags of white water are his company

for john limon the game of baseball is not a metaphor and i know it ’ s not really life the chalky green diamond the lovely dusty brown lanes i see from airplanes multiplying around the cities are only neat playing fields their structure is not the frame of history carved out of forest that is not what i see on my ascent and down in the stadium the veteran catcher guiding the young pitcher through the innings the line of concentration between them that delicate filament is not like the way you are helping me only it reminds me when i strain for analogies the way a rookie strains for perfection and the veteran in his wisdom seems to promise it it glows from his upheld glove and the man in front of me in the grandstand drinking banana daiquiris from a thermos continuing through a whole dinner to the aromatic cigar even as our team is shut out nearly hitless he is not like the farmer that auden speaks of in breughel ’ s icarus or the four inevitable woman-hating drunkards yelling hugging each other and moving up and down continuously for more beer and the young wife trying to understand what a full count could be to please her husband happy in his old dreams or the little boy in the yankees cap already nodding off to sleep against his father program and popcorn memories sliding into the future and the old woman from lincoln maine screaming at the yankee slugger with wounded knees to break his leg this is not a microcosm not even a slice of life and the terrible slumps when the greatest hitter mysteriously goes hitless for weeks or the pitcher ’ s stuff is all junk who threw like a magician all last month or the days when our guys look like sennett cops slipping bumping each other then suddenly the play that wasn ’ t humanly possible the kid we know isn ’ t ready for the big leagues leaps into the air to catch a ball that should have gone downtown and coming off the field is hugged and bottom-slapped by the sudden sorcerers the winning team the question of what makes a man slump when his form his eye his power aren ’ t to blame this isn ’ t like the bad luck that hounds us and his frustration in the games not like our deep rage for disappointing ourselves the ball park is an artifact manicured safe “ scene in an easter egg ” and the order of the ball game the firm structure with the mystery of accidents always contained not the wild field we wander in where i ’ m trying to recite the rules to repeat the statistics of the game and the wind keeps carrying my words away
every day i peruse the box scores for hours sometimes i wonder why i do it since i am not going to take a test on it and no one is going to give me money the pleasure ’ s something like that of codes of deciphering an ancient alphabet say so as brightly to picturize eurydice in the elysian fields on her perfect day the day she went 5 for 5 against vic raschi
this year an ocean trip i took and as i am a scot and like to get my money ’ s worth i never missed a meal in spite of neptune ’ s nastiness i ate an awful lot yet felt as fit as if we sailed upon an even keel but now that i am home again i ’ m stricken with disgust how many pounds of fat i ’ ve gained i ’ d rather not divulge well anyway i mean to take this tummy down or bust so here i ’ m suet-strafing in the battle of the bulge no more will sausage bacon eggs provide my breakfast fare on lobster i will never lunch with mounds of mayonnaise at tea i ’ ll spartanly eschew the chocolate éclair roast duckling and pêche melba shall not consummate my days no more nocturnal ice-box raids midnight spaghetti feeds on slabs of pâté de foie gras i vow i won ’ t indulge let bran and cottage cheese suffice my gastronomic needs and lettuce be my ally in the battle of the bulge to hell with you ignoble paunch abhorrent in my sight i gaze at your rotundity and savage is my frown i ’ ll rub you and i ’ ll scrub you and i ’ ll drub you day and night but by the gods of symmetry i swear i ’ ll get you down your smooth and smug convexity by heck i will subdue and when you tucker in again with joy will i refulge no longer of my toes will you obstruct my downward view ... with might and main i ’ ll fight to gain the battle of the bulge
1 in late winter i sometimes glimpse bits of steam coming up from some fault in the old snow and bend close and see it is lung-colored and put down my nose and know the chilly enduring odor of bear 2 i take a wolf ’ s rib and whittle it sharp at both ends and coil it up and freeze it in blubber and place it out on the fairway of the bears and when it has vanished i move out on the bear tracks roaming in circles until i come to the first tentative dark splash on the earth and i set out running following the splashes of blood wandering over the world at the cut gashed resting places i stop and rest at the crawl-marks where he lay out on his belly to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice i lie out dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists 3 on the third day i begin to starve at nightfall i bend down as i knew i would at a turd sopped in blood and hesitate and pick it up and thrust it in my mouth and gnash it down and rise and go on running 4 on the seventh day living by now on bear blood alone i can see his upturned carcass far out ahead a scraggled steamy hulk the heavy fur riffling in the wind i come up to him and stare at the narrow-spaced petty eyes the dismayed face laid back on the shoulder the nostrils flared catching perhaps the first taint of me as he died i hack a ravine in his thigh and eat and drink and tear him down his whole length and open him and climb in and close him up after me against the wind and sleep 5 and dream of lumbering flatfooted over the tundra stabbed twice from within splattering a trail behind me splattering it out no matter which way i lurch no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence which dance of solitude i attempt which gravity-clutched leap which trudge which groan 6 until one day i totter and fall— fall on this stomach that has tried so hard to keep up to digest the blood as it leaked in to break up and digest the bone itself and now the breeze blows over me blows off the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood and rotted stomach and the ordinary wretched odor of bear blows across my sore lolled tongue a song or screech until i think i must rise up and dance and i lie still 7 i awaken i think marshlights reappear geese come trailing again up the flyway in her ravine under old snow the dam-bear lies licking lumps of smeared fur and drizzly eyes into shapes with her tongue and one hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me the next groaned out the next the next the rest of my days i spend wandering wondering what anyway was that sticky infusion that rank flavor of blood that poetry by which i lived
beat beat drums —blow bugles blow through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force into the solemn church and scatter the congregation into the school where the scholar is studying leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride nor the peaceful farmer any peace ploughing his field or gathering his grain so fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles blow beat beat drums —blow bugles blow over the traffic of cities—over the rumble of wheels in the streets are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses no sleepers must sleep in those beds no bargainers ’ bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—would they continue would the talkers be talking would the singer attempt to sing would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge then rattle quicker heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow beat beat drums —blow bugles blow make no parley—stop for no expostulation mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer mind not the old man beseeching the young man let not the child ’ s voice be heard nor the mother ’ s entreaties make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses so strong you thump o terrible drums—so loud you bugles blow

we were running out of breath as we ran out to meet ourselves we were surfacing the edge of our ancestors ’ fights and ready to strike it was difficult to lose days in the indian bar if you were straight easy if you played pool and drank to remember to forget we made plans to be professional — and did and some of us could sing so we drummed a fire-lit pathway up to those starry stars sin was invented by the christians as was the devil we sang we were the heathens but needed to be saved from them — thin chance we knew we were all related in this story a little gin will clarify the dark and make us all feel like dancing we had something to do with the origins of blues and jazz i argued with a pueblo as i filled the jukebox with dimes in june forty years later and we still want justice we are still america we know the rumors of our demise we spit them out they die soon
saturday mornings before my weekly chores i used to sneak out of the house and across the street grabbing the first grasshopper walking in the damp california grass along the stream carefully hiding a silver hook beneath its green wings i 'd float it out across the gentle ripples towards the end of its life just like that i 'd give it the hook and let it ride all i ever expected for it was that big-mouth bass awaiting its arrival i did n't think that i was giving up one life to get another that even childhood was full of sacrifice i 'd just take the bright green thing pluck it off its only stalk and give it away as if it were mine to give i knew someone out there would be fooled that someone would accept the precious gift so i just sent it along with a plea of a prayer hoping it would spread its wings this time and fly across that wet glass sky no concern for what inspired its life or mine only instinct guiding pain towards the other side

where the remote bermudas ride in th ’ ocean ’ s bosom unespy ’ d from a small boat that row ’ d along the list ’ ning winds receiv ’ d this song what should we do but sing his praise that led us through the wat ’ ry maze unto an isle so long unknown and yet far kinder than our own where he the huge sea-monsters wracks that lift the deep upon their backs he lands us on a grassy stage safe from the storm ’ s and prelates ’ rage he gave us this eternal spring which here enamels everything and sends the fowls to us in care on daily visits through the air he hangs in shades the orange bright like golden lamps in a green night and does in the pomegranates close jewels more rich than ormus shows he makes the figs our mouths to meet and throws the melons at our feet but apples plants of such a price no tree could ever bear them twice with cedars chosen by his hand from lebanon he stores the land and makes the hollow seas that roar proclaim the ambergris on shore he cast of which we rather boast the gospel ’ s pearl upon our coast and in these rocks for us did frame a temple where to sound his name oh let our voice his praise exalt till it arrive at heaven ’ s vault which thence perhaps rebounding may echo beyond the mexic bay thus sung they in the english boat an holy and a cheerful note and all the way to guide their chime with falling oars they kept the time
old court old chain net hanging in frayed links from the rim the metal blackboard dented darker where the ball for over thirty years has kissed it the blacktop buckling the white lines nearly worn away old common ground where none of the black men warming up before the basket will answer or even look in my direction when i ask if i can run too the chill a mutual understanding one of the last we share letting me join them here if nowhere else by not letting me forget i don ’ t belong old court old courtesy handshake exchange of names in the early days of bussing between assassinations before our quaint welcoming of them had come to seem even to ourselves the haughty overflow of wealth so thoroughly our own we didn ’ t need to see it old beautiful delusion in those courtly gestures that everything now beyond our wanting just to play was out of bounds and we were free between the white lines of whatever we assumed we each of us assumed old court old dream dreamed by the weave the trap the backdoor pass old fluid legacy among the others that conjures even now within our bodies and between them such a useless such an intimate forgetting as in the moment when you get a step on your defender and can tell exactly by how another man comes at you where your own man is and without looking lob the ball up in the air so perfectly as he arrives that in a single motion he can catch and finger roll it in old court old dwindling cease fire with no hope of peace that we silently turn away from when the game is over hurrying back as if believing contact meant contagion to our separate tribes to the cleansing fires of what despite ourselves we momentarily forgot old lore old news old burning certitudes we can ’ t stoke high or hot enough yet won ’ t stop ever stoking until whatever it is we think we are anneals and toughens into an impenetrable shield
night is longing longing longing beyond all endurance —henry miller the back roads i ’ ve traveled late at night alone a little drunk wishing i were someone on whom nothing is lost are the roads by day i take to the car wash in hammonton or to blue anchor ’ s lawnmower repair shop when the self-propel mechanism goes fascinating how the lamplight that ’ s beckoned from solitary windows gives way to white shutters and occasionally a woman in her yard bending over something conspicuously in bloom so much then is duty duty duty and so much with the sun visor tilted and destination known can be endured but at night no even at night so much can be endured i ’ ve known only one man who left the road followed an intriguing light to its source he told me that he knocked many times before it became clear to him he must break down the door

just off the highway to rochester minnesota twilight bounds softly forth on the grass and the eyes of those two indian ponies darken with kindness they have come gladly out of the willows to welcome my friend and me we step over the barbed wire into the pasture where they have been grazing all day alone they ripple tensely they can hardly contain their happiness that we have come they bow shyly as wet swans they love each other there is no loneliness like theirs at home once more they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness i would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms for she has walked over to me and nuzzled my left hand she is black and white her mane falls wild on her forehead and the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear that is delicate as the skin over a girl ’ s wrist suddenly i realize that if i stepped out of my body i would break into blossom

a bridge engineer mr. crumpett built a bridge for the good river bumpett a mistake in the plan left a gap in the span but he said “ well they 'll just have to jump it ”
`` build me straight o worthy master stanch and strong a goodly vessel that shall laugh at all disaster and with wave and whirlwind wrestle '' the merchant 's word delighted the master heard for his heart was in his work and the heart giveth grace unto every art a quiet smile played round his lips as the eddies and dimples of the tide play round the bows of ships that steadily at anchor ride and with a voice that was full of glee he answered `` erelong we will launch a vessel as goodly and strong and stanch as ever weathered a wintry sea '' and first with nicest skill and art perfect and finished in every part a little model the master wrought which should be to the larger plan what the child is to the man its counterpart in miniature that with a hand more swift and sure the greater labor might be brought to answer to his inward thought and as he labored his mind ran o'er the various ships that were built of yore and above them all and strangest of all towered the great harry crank and tall whose picture was hanging on the wall with bows and stern raised high in air and balconies hanging here and there and signal lanterns and flags afloat and eight round towers like those that frown from some old castle looking down upon the drawbridge and the moat and he said with a smile `` our ship i wis shall be of another form than this '' it was of another form indeed built for freight and yet for speed a beautiful and gallant craft broad in the beam that the stress of the blast pressing down upon sail and mast might not the sharp bows overwhelm broad in the beam but sloping aft with graceful curve and slow degrees that she might be docile to the helm and that the currents of parted seas closing behind with mighty force might aid and not impede her course in the ship-yard stood the master with the model of the vessel that should laugh at all disaster and with wave and whirlwind wrestle covering many a rood of ground lay the timber piled around timber of chestnut and elm and oak and scattered here and there with these the knarred and crooked cedar knees brought from regions far away from pascagoula 's sunny bay and the banks of the roaring roanoke ah what a wondrous thing it is to note how many wheels of toil one thought one word can set in motion there 's not a ship that sails the ocean but every climate every soil must bring its tribute great or small and help to build the wooden wall the sun was rising o'er the sea and long the level shadows lay as if they too the beams would be of some great airy argosy framed and launched in a single day that silent architect the sun had hewn and laid them every one ere the work of man was yet begun beside the master when he spoke a youth against an anchor leaning listened to catch his slightest meaning only the long waves as they broke in ripples on the pebbly beach interrupted the old man 's speech beautiful they were in sooth the old man and the fiery youth the old man in whose busy brain many a ship that sailed the main was modelled o'er and o'er again — the fiery youth who was to be the heir of his dexterity the heir of his house and his daughter 's hand when he had built and launched from land what the elder head had planned `` thus '' said he `` will we build this ship lay square the blocks upon the slip and follow well this plan of mine choose the timbers with greatest care of all that is unsound beware for only what is sound and strong to this vessel shall belong cedar of maine and georgia pine here together shall combine a goodly frame and a goodly fame and the union be her name for the day that gives her to the sea shall give my daughter unto thee '' the master 's word enraptured the young man heard and as he turned his face aside with a look of joy and a thrill of pride standing before her father 's door he saw the form of his promised bride the sun shone on her golden hair and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair with the breath of morn and the soft sea air like a beauteous barge was she still at rest on the sandy beach just beyond the billow 's reach but he was the restless seething stormy sea ah how skilful grows the hand that obeyeth love 's command it is the heart and not the brain that to the highest doth attain and he who followeth love 's behest far excelleth all the rest thus with the rising of the sun was the noble task begun and soon throughout the ship-yard 's bounds were heard the intermingled sounds of axes and of mallets plied with vigorous arms on every side plied so deftly and so well that ere the shadows of evening fell the keel of oak for a noble ship scarfed and bolted straight and strong was lying ready and stretched along the blocks well placed upon the slip happy thrice happy every one who sees his labor well begun and not perplexed and multiplied by idly waiting for time and tide and when the hot long day was o'er the young man at the master 's door sat with the maiden calm and still and within the porch a little more removed beyond the evening chill the father sat and told them tales of wrecks in the great september gales of pirates coasting the spanish main and ships that never came back again the chance and change of a sailor 's life want and plenty rest and strife his roving fancy like the wind that nothing can stay and nothing can bind and the magic charm of foreign lands with shadows of palms and shining sands where the tumbling surf o'er the coral reefs of madagascar washes the feet of the swarthy lascar as he lies alone and asleep on the turf and the trembling maiden held her breath at the tales of that awful pitiless sea with all its terror and mystery the dim dark sea so like unto death that divides and yet unites mankind and whenever the old man paused a gleam from the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume the silent group in the twilight gloom and thoughtful faces as in a dream and for a moment one might mark what had been hidden by the dark that the head of the maiden lay at rest tenderly on the young man 's breast day by day the vessel grew with timbers fashioned strong and true stemson and keelson and sternson-knee till framed with perfect symmetry a skeleton ship rose up to view and around the bows and along the side the heavy hammers and mallets plied till after many a week at length wonderful for form and strength sublime in its enormous bulk loomed aloft the shadowy hulk and around it columns of smoke upwreathing rose from the boiling bubbling seething caldron that glowed and overflowed with the black tar heated for the sheathing and amid the clamors of clattering hammers he who listened heard now and then the song of the master and his men — '' build me straight o worthy master staunch and strong a goodly vessel that shall laugh at all disaster and with wave and whirlwind wrestle '' with oaken brace and copper band lay the rudder on the sand that like a thought should have control over the movement of the whole and near it the anchor whose giant hand would reach down and grapple with the land and immovable and fast hold the great ship against the bellowing blast and at the bows an image stood by a cunning artist carved in wood with robes of white that far behind seemed to be fluttering in the wind it was not shaped in a classic mould not like a nymph or goddess of old or naiad rising from the water but modelled from the master 's daughter on many a dreary and misty night 't will be seen by the rays of the signal light speeding along through the rain and the dark like a ghost in its snow-white sark the pilot of some phantom bark guiding the vessel in its flight by a path none other knows aright behold at last each tall and tapering mast is swung into its place shrouds and stays holding it firm and fast long ago in the deer-haunted forests of maine when upon mountain and plain lay the snow they fell — those lordly pines those grand majestic pines 'mid shouts and cheers the jaded steers panting beneath the goad dragged down the weary winding road those captive kings so straight and tall to be shorn of their streaming hair and naked and bare to feel the stress and the strain of the wind and the reeling main whose roar would remind them forevermore of their native forests they should not see again and everywhere the slender graceful spars poise aloft in the air and at the mast-head white blue and red a flag unrolls the stripes and stars ah when the wanderer lonely friendless in foreign harbors shall behold that flag unrolled 't will be as a friendly hand stretched out from his native land filling his heart with memories sweet and endless all is finished and at length has come the bridal day of beauty and of strength to-day the vessel shall be launched with fleecy clouds the sky is blanched and o'er the bay slowly in all his splendors dight the great sun rises to behold the sight the ocean old centuries old strong as youth and as uncontrolled paces restless to and fro up and down the sands of gold his beating heart is not at rest and far and wide with ceaseless flow his beard of snow heaves with the heaving of his breast he waits impatient for his bride there she stands with her foot upon the sands decked with flags and streamers gay in honor of her marriage day her snow-white signals fluttering blending round her like a veil descending ready to be the bride of the gray old sea on the deck another bride is standing by her lover 's side shadows from the flags and shrouds like the shadows cast by clouds broken by many a sunny fleck fall around them on the deck the prayer is said the service read the joyous bridegroom bows his head and in tears the good old master shakes the brown hand of his son kisses his daughter 's glowing cheek in silence for he can not speak and ever faster down his own the tears begin to run the worthy pastor — the shepherd of that wandering flock that has the ocean for its wold that has the vessel for its fold leaping ever from rock to rock — spake with accents mild and clear words of warning words of cheer but tedious to the bridegroom 's ear he knew the chart of the sailor 's heart all its pleasures and its griefs all its shallows and rocky reefs all those secret currents that flow with such resistless undertow and lift and drift with terrible force the will from its moorings and its course therefore he spake and thus said he — '' like unto ships far off at sea outward or homeward bound are we before behind and all around floats and swings the horizon 's bound seems at its distant rim to rise and climb the crystal wall of the skies and then again to turn and sink as if we could slide from its outer brink ah it is not the sea it is not the sea that sinks and shelves but ourselves that rock and rise with endless and uneasy motion now touching the very skies now sinking into the depths of ocean ah if our souls but poise and swing like the compass in its brazen ring ever level and ever true to the toil and the task we have to do we shall sail securely and safely reach the fortunate isles on whose shining beach the sights we see and the sounds we hear will be those of joy and not of fear '' then the master with a gesture of command waved his hand and at the word loud and sudden there was heard all around them and below the sound of hammers blow on blow knocking away the shores and spurs and see she stirs she starts — she moves — she seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel and spurning with her foot the ground with one exulting joyous bound she leaps into the ocean 's arms and lo from the assembled crowd there rose a shout prolonged and loud that to the ocean seemed to say '' take her o bridegroom old and gray take her to thy protecting arms with all her youth and all her charms '' how beautiful she is how fair she lies within those arms that press her form with many a soft caress of tenderness and watchful care sail forth into the sea o ship through wind and wave right onward steer the moistened eye the trembling lip are not the signs of doubt or fear sail forth into the sea of life o gentle loving trusting wife and safe from all adversity upon the bosom of that sea thy comings and thy goings be for gentleness and love and trust prevail o'er angry wave and gust and in the wreck of noble lives something immortal still survives thou too sail on o ship of state sail on o union strong and great humanity with all its fears with all the hopes of future years is hanging breathless on thy fate we know what master laid thy keel what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel who made each mast and sail and rope what anvils rang what hammers beat in what a forge and what a heat were shaped the anchors of thy hope fear not each sudden sound and shock 't is of the wave and not the rock 't is but the flapping of the sail and not a rent made by the gale in spite of rock and tempest 's roar in spite of false lights on the shore sail on nor fear to breast the sea our hearts our hopes are all with thee our hearts our hopes our prayers our tears our faith triumphant o'er our fears are all with thee — are all with thee

up the reputable walks of old established trees they stalk children of the nouveaux riches chimes of the tall clock tower drench their heads in blessing “ i do n't wan na play at your house i do n't like you any more. ” my house stands opposite on the other hill among meadows with the orchard fences down and falling deer come almost to the door you can not see it even in this clearest morning white birds hang in the air between over the garbage landfill and those homes thereto adjacent hovering slowly turning settling down like the flakes sifting imperceptibly onto the little town in a waterball of glass and yet this morning beyond this quiet scene the floating birds the backyards of the poor beyond the shopping plaza the dead canal the hillside lying tilted in the air tomorrow has broken out today riot in algeria in cyprus in alabama aged in wrong the empires are declining and china gathers soundlessly like evidence what shall i say to the young on such a morning — mind is the one salvation —also grammar — no my little ones lean not toward revolt they are the whites the vaguely furiously driven who resist their souls with such passivity as would make quakers swear all day dear lord all day they wear their godhead lightly they look out from their hill and say to themselves “ we have nowhere to go but down the great destination is to stay. ” surely the nations will be reasonable they look at the world—do n't they —the world 's way the clock just now has nothing more to say

carpenters whose wives have run off are sometimes discovered weeping on the job but even then they don ’ t complain of their work whitman ’ s father was a carpenter he was so happy hammering houses that he jumped with a shout from the roof beam and rolled with a yawp in the timothy this led his son to conclude wrongly that all workmen are singers whitman ’ s father was weak he had trouble holding a job he hoped that the house he was working on would be lived in by a man more steady than he was who would earn his sleep dreaming easy under a sound roof with no rain in his face of course there are bad carpenters everywhere they don ’ t care if the walls don ’ t meet “ after all ” they argue “ we ’ re not building airplanes. ” but whitman ’ s father measured his nails many mornings clacking his plane he crooned a song to the corners urging them on to a snug fit no needles of heat will escape through a crack if he can help it no threads of light
forth from calais at dawn of night when sunset summer on autumn shone fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone soft and sweet as the sky they smiled and bade man welcome a dim sweet hour gleamed and whispered in wind and sea and heaven was fair as a field in flower stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music the star-bright air made the face of the sea if aught may make the face of the sea more fair whence came change was the sweet night weary of rest what anguish awoke in the dark sudden sublime the strong storm spake we heard the thunders as hounds that bark lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars we saw the lightnings exalt the sky living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die heaven 's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire thunder on thunder exulted rejoicing to live and to satiate the night 's desire and the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free and a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea all the weight of the wind bore down on it freighted with death for fraught and the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught and madness fell on them laughing and leaping and madness came on the wind and the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of ind such glory such terror such passion as lighten and harrow the far fierce east rang shone spake shuddered around us the night was an altar with death for priest the channel that sunders england from shores where never was man born free was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea as a wild steed ramps in rebellion and rears till it swerves from a backward fall the strong ship struggled and reared and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff 's wall stern and prow plunged under alternate a glimpse a recoil a breath and she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death three glad hours and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird 's heart in a boy for the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed sublime as the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time the glory beholden of man in a vision the music of light overheard the rapture and radiance of battle the life that abides in the fire of a word in the midmost heaven enkindled was manifest far on the face of the sea and the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free far eastward clear of the covering of cloud the sky laughed out into light from the rims of the storm to the sea 's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white the leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade from the cloud 's black base to the black wave 's brim rejoiced in the light they made far westward throned in a silent sky where life was in lustrous tune shone sweeter and surer than morning or evening the steadfast smile of the moon the limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold and deep as life or as death revealed and transfigured may shine on the soul through sleep all glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship above and below the joys of the lightnings the songs of the thunders the strong sea 's labour and rage were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage no thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare illimitable infinite awful and joyful alive in the summit of air— air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea 's rebellious rapturous and transient as faith or as terror that bows men 's knees no love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams than the world shone then when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath 's length seems— one utterly mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides as the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm and released the tides in the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering assailed and withheld as a soul born royal if life or if death be against it is thwarted and quelled as the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn a thousand phosphors a thousand hespers awoke in the churning sea and the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be as a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep audible alway alive in the storm too fleet for a dream to keep too fleet too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake light subtler and swifter than lightning that whispers and laughs in the live storm 's wake in the wild bright wake of the storm in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour a harvest of stars by the storm 's hand reaped each fair as a star-shaped flower and sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed when the light and the sound of it sank and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed the glory the terror the passion that made of the midnight a miracle died not slain at a stroke nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride with strong swift subsidence awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth as a god that were wearied of power upon heaven and were fain of a new god 's birth the might of the night subsided the tyranny kindled in darkness fell and the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell the waters heaving and hungering at heart made way and were wellnigh fain for the ship that had fought them and wrestled and revelled in labour to cease from her pain and an end was made of it only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife and the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life
the housework the factory work the work that takes from the body and does not put back the white-collar work and the dirt of its profits the terrible politeness of the office worker the work that robs the viscera to pay the cool surfaces of the brain all the work that makes love difficult brings on sleep drops the body off at the liquor cabinet all the work that reaches the intestines and sprawls and the compulsive work after the work is done those unfillable spaces of the calvinist or certain marriage beds
i worked the river ’ s slick banks grabbling in mud holes underneath tree roots you ’ d think it would be dangerous but i never came up with a cooter or cottonmouth hung on my fingertips occasionally though i leapt upright my fingers hooked through the red gills of a mudcat and then i thrilled the thrill my father felt when he burst home from fishing drunk and yelled well before dawn “ wake up come here ” he tossed some fatwood on the fire and flames raged spat and flickered he held a four-foot mudcat “ i caught it ” he yelled “ i caught this monster ” at first dream-dazed i thought it was something he ’ d saved us from by firelight the fish gleamed wickedly but father laughed and hugged me hard pressing my head against his coat which stank and glittered where dried scales caught the light for breakfast he fried enormous chunks of fish the whole house glorious for days with their rich stink one scale stuck to my face and as we ate he blinked until he understood what made me glitter he laughed reached over flicked the star off of my face that ’ s how i felt —that wild — when i jerked struggling fish out of the mud and held them up long muscles shuddering on my fingers once grabbling i got lost i traced the river to the marsh absorbed with fishing then absorbed with ants with a flat piece of bark i ’ d scoop red ants onto a black-ant hill and watch then i would shovel black ants on a red-ant hill to see what difference that would make not much and i returned to grabbling then skimming stones before i knew it i ’ d worked my way from fresh water to salt and i was lost sawgrass waved swayed and swung above my head pushed down it sprang back slashed at it slashed back all i could see was sawgrass where was the sea where land with every step the mud sucked at my feet with gasps and sobs that came so close to speech i sang in harmony with them my footprints filled with brine as i walked on still fascinated with the sweat bees hornets burrow bees and god forgive me i was not afraid of anything lost in sawgrass i knew for sure just up and down almost enough since then they are the only things i ’ ve had much faith in night fell the slow moon rose from sawgrass soon afterward i heard some cries and answered them so i was saved from things i didn ’ t want to be saved from ma tested her green switch —zip zip — then laid it on my thighs oh maybe twice before she fell in tears across my neck she sobbed and combed my hair of cockleburs she laughed as she dabbed alcohol into my cuts i flinched she chuckled and even as a child i heard inside her sobs and chuckling the lovely sucking sound of earth that followed me gasped called my name as i stomped through the mud wrenched free and heard the earth ’ s voice under me
i lay my head sideways on the desk my fingers interlocked under my cheekbones my eyes closed it was a three-room schoolhouse white with a small bell tower an oak tree from where i sat on still days i ’ d watch the oak the prisoner of that sky or read the desk carved with adults ’ names marietta martin truman finnell marjorie elm the wood hacked or lovingly hollowed the flies settling on the obsolete built-in inkwells i remember tonight only details how mrs. avery now gone was standing then in her beige dress its quiet gazelle print still dark with lines of perspiration from the day before how gracie chin had just shown me how to draw with chalk a chinese ideogram where did she go white thigh with one still freckle lost in silk no one would say for sure so that i ’ d know so that all shapes for days after seemed brushstrokes in chinese countries on maps that shifted changed colors or disappeared lithuania prussia bessarabia the numbers four seven the question mark that year i ate almost nothing i thought my parents weren ’ t my real parents i thought there ’ d been some terrible mistake at recess i would sit alone seeing in the print of each leaf shadow an ideogram— still indecipherable beneath the green sound the bell still made even after it had faded when the dust-covered leaves of the oak tree quivered slightly if i looked up in time and my father so distant in those days where did he go that autumn when he chose the chaste faint ideogram of ash i had to leave him there white bones in a puzzle by a plum tree the sun rising over the sierras it is not chinese but english— when the past tense when you first learn to use it as a child throws all the verbs in the language into the long flat shade of houses you ride past into town your father ’ s driving on winter evenings the lights would come on earlier people would be shopping for christmas each hand with the one whorl of its fingerprints with twenty delicate bones inside it reaching up to touch some bolt of cloth or choose a gift a little different from any other hand you know how the past tense turns a sentence dark but leaves names lovers places showing through gracie chin my father lithuania a beige dress where dark gazelles hold still outside it ’ s snowing cold a new year the trees streets are turning white i always thought he would come back like this i always thought he wouldn ’ t dare be seen
when my mother died i was very young and my father sold me while yet my tongue could scarcely cry `` 'weep 'weep 'weep 'weep '' so your chimneys i sweep in soot i sleep there 's little tom dacre who cried when his head that curled like a lamb 's back was shaved so i said '' hush tom never mind it for when your head 's bare you know that the soot can not spoil your white hair '' and so he was quiet that very night as tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight that thousands of sweepers dick joe ned jack were all of them locked up in coffins of black and by came an angel who had a bright key and he opened the coffins set them all free then down a green plain leaping laughing they run and wash in a river and shine in the sun then naked white all their bags left behind they rise upon clouds and sport in the wind and the angel told tom if he 'd be a good boy he 'd have god for his father never want joy and so tom awoke and we rose in the dark and got with our bags our brushes to work though the morning was cold tom was happy warm so if all do their duty they need not fear harm
i the children on the lawn joined hand to hand go round and round each arm going into the next arm around full circle until it comes back into each of the single bodies again they are singing but not to each other their feet move almost in time to the singing we can see the concentration on their faces their eyes fixed on the empty moving spaces just in front of them we might mistake this tranced moving for joy but there is no joy in it we can see arm in arm as we watch them go round and round intent almost studious the grass underfoot ignored the trees circling the lawn ignored the lake ignored that the whole point for them of going round and round is faster slower going round and round ii being with you here in this room is like groping through a mirror whose glass has melted to the consistency of gelatin you refuse to be and i an exact reflection yet will not walk from the glass be separate anyway it is right that they have put so many mirrors here chipped hung crooked in this room with its high transom and empty wardrobe even the back of the door has one there are people in the next room arguing opening and closing drawers the walls are thin you look past me listening to them perhaps or watching your own reflection somewhere behind my head over my shoulder you shift and the bed sags under us losing its focus there is someone in the next room there is always your face remote listening someone in the next room iii however in all their games there seems to be some reason however abstract they at first appear when we read them legends in the evening of monstrous battles and secret betrayals in the forest and brutal deaths they scarcely listened one yawned and fidgeted another chewed the wooden handle of a hammer the youngest one examined a slight cut on his toe and we wondered how they could remain completely without fear or even interest as the final sword slid through the dying hero the next night walking along the beach we found the trenches they had been making fortified with pointed sticks driven into the sides of their sand moats and a lake-enclosed island with no bridges a last attempt however eroded by the water in an hour to make maybe a refuge human and secure from the reach of whatever walks along sword hearted these night beaches iv returning to the room i notice how all your word- plays calculated ploys of the body the witticisms of touch are now attempts to keep me at a certain distance and at length avoid admitting i am here i watch you watching my face indifferently yet with the same taut curiosity with which you might regard a suddenly discovered part of your own body a wart perhaps and i remember that you said in childhood you were a tracer of maps not making but moving a pen or a forefinger over the courses of the rivers the different colours that mark the rise of mountains a memorizer of names to hold these places in their proper places so now you trace me like a country ’ s boundary or a strange new wrinkle in your own wellknown skin and i am fixed stuck down on the outspread map of this room of your mind ’ s continent here and yet not here like the wardrobe and the mirrors the voices through the wall your body ignored on the bed transfixed by your eyes ’ cold blue thumbtacks v the children like the block of grey stone that was once a fort but now is a museum especially they like the guns and the armour brought from other times and countries and when they go home their drawings will be full for some days of swords archaic sunburst maces broken spears and vivid red explosions while they explore the cannons they aren ’ t our children we walk outside along the earthworks noting how they are crumbling under the unceasing attacks of feet and flower roots the weapons that were once outside sharpening themselves on war are now indoors there in the fortress fragile in glass cases why is it i ’ m thinking of the careful moulding round the stonework archways that in this time such elaborate defences keep things that are no longer much worth defending vi and you play the safe game the orphan game the ragged winter game that says i am alone hungry i know you want me to play it also the game of the waif who stands at every picture window shivering pinched nose pressed against the glass the snow collecting on his neck watching the happy families a game of envy yet he despises them they are so victorian christmas-card the cheap paper shows under the pigments of their cheerful fire- places and satin- ribboned suburban laughter and they have their own forms of parlour games father and mother playing father and mother he ’ s glad to be left out by himself in the cold hugging himself when i tell you this you say with a smile fake as a tinsel icicle you do it too which in some ways is a lie but also i suppose is right as usual although i tend to pose in other seasons outside other windows vii summer again in the mirrors of this room the children wheel singing the same song this casual bed scruffy as dry turf the counterpane rumpled with small burrows is their grassy lawn and these scuffed walls contain their circling trees that low clogged sink their lake a wasp comes drawn by the piece of sandwich left on the nearby beach how carefully you do such details one of the children flinches but won ’ t let go you make them turn and turn according to the closed rules of your games but there is no joy in it and as we lie arm in arm neither joined nor separate your observations change me to a spineless woman in a cage of bones obsolete fort pulled inside out our lips moving almost in time to their singing listening to the opening and closing of the drawers in the next room of course there is always danger but where would you locate it the children spin a round cage of glass from the warm air with their thread-thin insect voices and as we lie here caught in the monotony of wandering from room to room shifting the place of our defences i want to break these bones your prisoning rhythms winter summer all the glass cases erase all maps crack the protecting eggshell of your turning singing children i want the circle broken
in her hand the knife brisk brilliant as moon-claw shaves the flesh it grazes the white belly just over the heart underneath the coiled fingers are cradling a soft flesh as if it were the jowls of the aged man propped for a while on the bench in the park the head is not severed the eyes not out blue they appear to flash odd ways where a tree makes a live shadow mostly the eyes are dead nothing is in them except the intense blue of sky the tree allows there is no conspiring of nerves no least event recalled by a limb ’ s high arching or even a girl ’ s ascension from a forgotten distance of water but there is something as she lifts the meat it is enough to draw down her gaze now her arm rises against yellow hair fallen white in a childish face she is still as a leaf barely clinging i come to her like a cat in the stunned grass and touch her to see the startled upthrusted gleam of her face at brow and each cheek like gathered beads of mist scales leap with the sun and are dead no word passes between us but something electric as a flash of steel makes her cry out just once squatting at the yard ’ s edge she sings beyond any thought her knife flies as lethal as love and cuts quickly in like a hurried kiss
walking back to the office after lunch i saw hans “ mister isham mister isham ” he called out in his hurry “ herr wegner needs you a woman waiting for a border pass took poison she is dead and the police are there to take the body. ” in the hall the secretaries stood outside their doors silently waiting with wegner “ sir ” he said “ it was her answer on the questionnaire a clerk for the gestapo so it was. ” within the outer office by the row of wooden chairs one lying on its side on the discolored brown linoleum floor under a gi blanket was the lost unmoving shape uncovered from a fold a dirty foot half out of a dirty shoe once white heel bent the sole worn through the skin bruised red and calloused uncut toenails curved and veined like an old ivory no one spoke police stood at attention by a stretcher after an empty moment suddenly bent over as if taken by a cramp i sobbed out loud and on my uniform vomited up my lunch—over the tie the polished buttons and insignia the little strips of color and the green eisenhower jacket with its eagle patch the taut pants in a crease the glistening jump-boots— vomiting and still sobbing like a child awakened in the night and sick wegner and hans held me murmuring “ ach dear sir the war is over and not over such things happen. ” while no one else moved frau schmidt brought a towel to clean me off before hans walked me back my arm across his shoulders and i retelling the story of how near zell am see we found hung from a tree in leaf the final sack of bones in rotted wehrmacht green in the house an ss lord had furnished for his mistress— deep sofas persian rugs and velvet drapes— frau könig took my clothes in my own room wearing the gucci robe bouchard had taken from a fine house before we got to ulm instead of lying down to rest i studied the book i read for german with frau schmidt goethe ’ s italian journey through the window the watchman ’ s upper slopes were shadows green and purple with the afternoon its snows melting its double peaks the victory sign

not in that wasted garden where bodies are drawn into grass that feeds no flocks and into evergreens that bear no fruit — there where along the shaded walks vain sighs are heard and vainer dreams are dreamed of close communion with departed souls — but here under the apple tree i loved and watched and pruned with gnarled hands in the long long years here under the roots of this northern-spy to move in the chemic change and circle of life into the soil and into the flesh of the tree and into the living epitaphs of redder apples

goodbye lady in bangor who sent me snapshots of yourself after definitely hinting you were beautiful goodbye miami beach urologist who enclosed plain brown envelopes for the return of your very “ clinical sonnets ” goodbye manufacturer of brassieres on the coast whose eclogues give the fullest treatment in literature yet to the sagging breast motif goodbye you in san quentin who wrote “ being german my hero is hitler ” instead of “ sincerely yours ” at the end of long neat-scripted letters extolling the pre-raphaelites i swear to you it was just my way of cheering myself up as i licked the stamped self-addressed envelopes the game i had of trying to guess which one of you this time had poisoned his glue i did care i did read each poem entire i did say everything i thought in the mildest words i knew and now in this poem or chopped prose no better i realize than those troubled lines i kept sending back to you i have to say i am relieved it is over at the end i could feel only pity for that urge toward more life your poems kept smothering in words the smell of which days later tingled in your nostrils as new god-given impulses to write goodbye you who are for me the postmarks again of imaginary towns—xenia burnt cabins hornell— their solitude given away in poems only their loneliness kept
it is an afternoon toward the end of august autumnal weather cool following on and riding in after the heat of summer into the empty afternoon shade and light the shade full of light without any thickness at all you can see right through and right down into the depth of the light and shade of the afternoon there isn ’ t any weight of the summer pressing down in the backyard of the house next door there ’ s a kid maybe eleven or twelve and a young man visitors at the house whom i don ’ t know the house in which the sound of some kind of party perhaps even a wedding is going on somehow you can tell from the tone of their voices that they don ’ t know each other very well— two guests at the party one of them maybe a friend of the bride or groom the other the son or the younger brother maybe of somebody there a couple of blocks away the wash of traffic dimly sounds as if we were near the ocean they ’ re shooting baskets amiably and mildly the noise of the basketball though startlingly louder than the voices of the two of them as they play is peaceable as can be something like meter the earnest voice of the kid girlish and manly and the voice of the young man carefully playing the game of having a grown-up conversation with him i can tell the young man is teaching the boy by example the easy way he dribbles the ball and passes it back with a single gesture of wrist to make it easy for the kid to be in synch giving and taking perfectly understood

there are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold the arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold the northern lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see was that night on the marge of lake lebarge i cremated sam mcgee now sam mcgee was from tennessee where the cotton blooms and blows why he left his home in the south to roam 'round the pole god only knows he was always cold but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell though he 'd often say in his homely way that `` he 'd sooner live in hell '' on a christmas day we were mushing our way over the dawson trail talk of your cold through the parka 's fold it stabbed like a driven nail if our eyes we 'd close then the lashes froze till sometimes we could n't see it was n't much fun but the only one to whimper was sam mcgee and that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow and the dogs were fed and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe he turned to me and `` cap '' says he `` i 'll cash in this trip i guess and if i do i 'm asking that you wo n't refuse my last request '' well he seemed so low that i could n't say no then he says with a sort of moan '' it 's the cursèd cold and it 's got right hold till i 'm chilled clean through to the bone yet 'tai n't being dead—it 's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains so i want you to swear that foul or fair you 'll cremate my last remains '' a pal 's last need is a thing to heed so i swore i would not fail and we started on at the streak of dawn but god he looked ghastly pale he crouched on the sleigh and he raved all day of his home in tennessee and before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of sam mcgee there was n't a breath in that land of death and i hurried horror-driven with a corpse half hid that i could n't get rid because of a promise given it was lashed to the sleigh and it seemed to say `` you may tax your brawn and brains but you promised true and it 's up to you to cremate those last remains '' now a promise made is a debt unpaid and the trail has its own stern code in the days to come though my lips were dumb in my heart how i cursed that load in the long long night by the lone firelight while the huskies round in a ring howled out their woes to the homeless snows— o god how i loathed the thing and every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow and on i went though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low the trail was bad and i felt half mad but i swore i would not give in and i 'd often sing to the hateful thing and it hearkened with a grin till i came to the marge of lake lebarge and a derelict there lay it was jammed in the ice but i saw in a trice it was called the `` alice may '' and i looked at it and i thought a bit and i looked at my frozen chum then `` here '' said i with a sudden cry `` is my cre-ma-tor-eum '' some planks i tore from the cabin floor and i lit the boiler fire some coal i found that was lying around and i heaped the fuel higher the flames just soared and the furnace roared—such a blaze you seldom see and i burrowed a hole in the glowing coal and i stuffed in sam mcgee then i made a hike for i did n't like to hear him sizzle so and the heavens scowled and the huskies howled and the wind began to blow it was icy cold but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks and i do n't know why and the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky i do not know how long in the snow i wrestled with grisly fear but the stars came out and they danced about ere again i ventured near i was sick with dread but i bravely said `` i 'll just take a peep inside i guess he 's cooked and it 's time i looked '' ... then the door i opened wide and there sat sam looking cool and calm in the heart of the furnace roar and he wore a smile you could see a mile and he said `` please close that door it 's fine in here but i greatly fear you 'll let in the cold and storm— since i left plumtree down in tennessee it 's the first time i 've been warm '' there are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold the arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold the northern lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see was that night on the marge of lake lebarge i cremated sam mcgee
1 flood-tide below me i see you face to face clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—i see you also face to face crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes how curious you are to me on the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross returning home are more curious to me than you suppose and you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me and more in my meditations than you might suppose 2 the impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day the simple compact well-join ’ d scheme myself disintegrated every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme the similitudes of the past and those of the future the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings on the walk in the street and the passage over the river the current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away the others that are to follow me the ties between me and them the certainty of others the life love sight hearing of others others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore others will watch the run of the flood-tide others will see the shipping of manhattan north and west and the heights of brooklyn to the south and east others will see the islands large and small fifty years hence others will see them as they cross the sun half an hour high a hundred years hence or ever so many hundred years hence others will see them will enjoy the sunset the pouring-in of the flood-tide the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide 3 it avails not time nor place—distance avails not i am with you you men and women of a generation or ever so many generations hence just as you feel when you look on the river and sky so i felt just as any of you is one of a living crowd i was one of a crowd just as you are refresh ’ d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow i was refresh ’ d just as you stand and lean on the rail yet hurry with the swift current i stood yet was hurried just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm ’ d pipes of steamboats i look ’ d i too many and many a time cross ’ d the river of old watched the twelfth-month sea-gulls saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings oscillating their bodies saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams look ’ d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water look ’ d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward look ’ d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet look ’ d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving saw their approach saw aboard those that were near me saw the white sails of schooners and sloops saw the ships at anchor the sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars the round masts the swinging motion of the hulls the slender serpentine pennants the large and small steamers in motion the pilots in their pilot-houses the white wake left by the passage the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels the flags of all nations the falling of them at sunset the scallop-edged waves in the twilight the ladled cups the frolicsome crests and glistening the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks on the river the shadowy group the big steam-tug closely flank ’ d on each side by the barges the hay-boat the belated lighter on the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets 4 these and all else were to me the same as they are to you i loved well those cities loved well the stately and rapid river the men and women i saw were all near to me others the same—others who look back on me because i look ’ d forward to them the time will come though i stop here to-day and to-night 5 what is it then between us what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us whatever it is it avails not—distance avails not and place avails not i too lived brooklyn of ample hills was mine i too walk ’ d the streets of manhattan island and bathed in the waters around it i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me in the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me in my walks home late at night or as i lay in my bed they came upon me i too had been struck from the float forever held in solution i too had receiv ’ d identity by my body that i was i knew was of my body and what i should be i knew i should be of my body 6 it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall the dark threw its patches down upon me also the best i had done seem ’ d to me blank and suspicious my great thoughts as i supposed them were they not in reality meagre nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil i am he who knew what it was to be evil i too knitted the old knot of contrariety blabb ’ d blush ’ d resented lied stole grudg ’ d had guile anger lust hot wishes i dared not speak was wayward vain greedy shallow sly cowardly malignant the wolf the snake the hog not wanting in me the cheating look the frivolous word the adulterous wish not wanting refusals hates postponements meanness laziness none of these wanting was one with the rest the days and haps of the rest was call ’ d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing felt their arms on my neck as i stood or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as i sat saw many i loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly yet never told them a word lived the same life with the rest the same old laughing gnawing sleeping play ’ d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress the same old role the role that is what we make it as great as we like or as small as we like or both great and small 7 closer yet i approach you what thought you have of me now i had as much of you—i laid in my stores in advance i consider ’ d long and seriously of you before you were born who was to know what should come home to me who knows but i am enjoying this who knows for all the distance but i am as good as looking at you now for all you can not see me 8 ah what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm ’ d manhattan river and sunset and scallop-edg ’ d waves of flood-tide the sea-gulls oscillating their bodies the hay-boat in the twilight and the belated lighter what gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand and with voices i love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as i approach what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face which fuses me into you now and pours my meaning into you we understand then do we not what i promis

deep in our refrigerator there 's a special place for food that 's been around awhile we keep it just in case “ it 's probably too old to eat ” my mother likes to say “ but i do n't think it 's old enough for me to throw away. ” it stays there for a month or more to ripen in the cold and soon we notice fuzzy clumps of multicolored mold the clumps are larger every day we notice this as well but mostly what we notice is a certain special smell when finally it all becomes a nasty mass of slime my mother takes it out and says “ apparently it 's time. ” she dumps it in the garbage can though not without regret then fills the space with other food that 's not so ancient yet

it seemed those rose-pink dishes she kept for special company were always cold brought down from the shelf in jingling stacks the plates like the panes of ice she broke from the water bucket winter mornings the flaring cups like tulips that opened too early and got bitten by frost they chilled the coffee no matter how quickly you drank while a heavy everyday mug would have kept a splash hot for the better part of a conversation it was hard to hold up your end of the gossip with your coffee cold but it was a special occasion just the same to sit at her kitchen table and sip the bitter percolation of the past week ’ s rumors from cups it had taken a year to collect at the grocery with one piece free for each five pounds of flour

for rafael heliodoro valle i set out from the port of acapulco on the twenty-third of march and kept a steady course until saturday the fourth of april when a half hour before dawn we saw by the light of the moon that a ship had come alongside with sails and a bow that seemed to be of silver our helmsman cried out to them to stand off but no one answered as though they were all asleep again we called out “ where did their ship come from ” and they said peru after which we heard trumpets and muskets firing and they ordered me to come down into their longboat to cross over to where their captain was i found him walking the deck went up to him kissed his hands and he asked me “ what silver or gold i had aboard that ship ” i said “ none at all none at all my lord only my dishes and cups. ” so then he asked me if i knew the viceroy i said i did and i asked the captain “ if he were captain drake himself and no other ” the captain replied that “ he was the very drake i spoke of. ” we spoke together a long time until the hour of dinner and he commanded that i sit by his side his dishes and cups are of silver bordered with gold with his crest upon them he has with him many perfumes and scented waters in crystal vials which he said the queen had given him he dines and sups always with music of violins and also takes with him everywhere painters who keep painting all the coast for him he is a man of some twenty-four years small with a reddish beard he is a nephew of juan aquinas the pirate and is one of the greatest mariners there are upon the sea the day after which was sunday he clothed himself in splendid garments and had them hoist all their flags with pennants of divers colors at the mastheads the bronze rings and chains and the railings and the lights on the alcazar shining like gold his ship was like a gold dragon among the dolphins and we went with his page to my ship to look at the coffers all day long until night he spent looking at what i had what he took from me was not much a few trifles of my own and he gave me a cutlass and a silver brassart for them asking me to forgive him since it was for his lady that he was taking them he would let me go he said the next morning as soon as there was a breeze for this i thanked him and kissed his hands he is carrying in his galleon three thousand bars of silver three coffers full of gold twelve great coffers of pieces of eight and he says he is heading for china following the charts and steered by a chinese pilot whom he captured ...
1. footfalls on the brickwork road many fathers laid by hand and heavy mallet make a sandy sound you can hear in the dusted scuff a kind of gasp as from the crumpled lungs of those bent double by depression by wagonloads of work— you can hear huffs of hot wind kick the dust around them you can feel the brickwork give this is how the town found a way from starving three summers running nothing but dust rained down to choke out cornfields and wheat the council paid any man driven to his knees to lay a road from here to cedar city to keep working they tapped in bricks from the limekiln one season they turned each one one-quarter twist the next 2. all night so far i have waited for the train to come calling through a cotton curtain on its breeze it always does—low as a mourning dove long minutes over the far darkening fields and many trees how huge the world must be to hear so far beyond the shade beyond the grasp of night there are apple boughs brushing my fine screen lightly and a dozen stars i know like pinpricks on an arm before it stops a train will hiss grind clatter all the way back while its car-locks bang then the engine at idle—hubbub wood smoke and trouble in the hobo camp below the trestle how sad the world is to hear nothing for so long it always comes sweet night wind like cider 3. i was watching the road where his car went and thirty years burned off as in a drop of oil i was scanning for dust on the rise a cartoon cowboy ’ s gallop it ’ s where he drove each morning off to work somewhere hard with the road crew— he returned each evening burned and hurt i have a good life and hands too soft for labor who would guess it takes this long to come home all week i have checked the old road as if nothing had come to pass—jars of peaches pinging on the kitchen sill her voice like silverware i was playing with a soldier and blue truck there ’ s a road to everywhere the song sweeps on i am watching the road where the car drove 4. you can feel the brickwork give beneath your step each such shift in sand and balanced earth is kindred to the world ’ s intrinsic drift cars kick up a clatter rumbling down the road— their tires grind brick to brick turn dust to dust when a truck goes by the whole street quakes you can feel your life begin to shake 5. hanging primrose breeze haze of barbeque the many children quieted by baths put to bed— they wait for the locusts ’ buzz and homing trains one lone bat recurrent in the streetlamp glow four blocks down the road gives way to asphalt blacktop but here the block stamp macon brick hasn ’ t rubbed off the red clay bars the many fathers wrecked their knees to pack tightly back into earth how small a world it is to want such work i will come here only once more to lie down too having lived to praise one thing made so well it sings with each slow passage rimmed with sleepers safe in all their loved and many beds flowers line every sidewalk down the breathing road
in his fifth year the son deep in the backseat of his father ’ s ford and the mysterium of time holds time in memory with words night this night on the way to a stalled rig south of kiowa creek where the plains wind stacks the skeletons of weeds on barbed-wire fences and rattles the battered dekalb sign to make the child think of time in its passing of death cattle stare at flat-bed haulers gunning clumps of black smoke and lugging damaged drill pipe up the gullied mud-hollowed road road this road roustabouts shouting from the crow ’ s nest float like ascension angels on a ring of lights chokecherries gouge the purpled sky cloud- swags running the moon under and starlight rains across the ford ’ s blue hood blue this blue later where black flies haunt the mud tank the boy walks along the pipe rack dragging a stick across the hollow ends to make a kind of music and the creek throbs with frog songs locusts the rasp of tree limbs blown and scattered the great horse people his father these sounds these shapes saved from time ’ s dark creek as the car moves across the moving earth world this world

i know my friend is going though she still sits there across from me in the restaurant and leans over the table to dip her bread in the oil on my plate i know how thick her hair used to be and what it takes for her to discard her man ’ s cap partway through our meal to look straight at the young waiter and smile when he asks how we are liking it she eats as though starving—chicken dolmata the buttery flakes of filo— and what ’ s killing her eats too i watch her lift a glistening black olive and peel the meat from the pit watch her fine long fingers and her face puffy from medication she lowers her eyes to the food pretending not to know what i know she ’ s going and we go on eating

teach me my god and king in all things thee to see and what i do in anything to do it as for thee not rudely as a beast to run into an action but still to make thee prepossest and give it his perfection a man that looks on glass on it may stay his eye or if he pleaseth through it pass and then the heav'n espy all may of thee partake nothing can be so mean which with his tincture— '' for thy sake '' — will not grow bright and clean a servant with this clause makes drudgery divine who sweeps a room as for thy laws makes that and th action fine this is the famous stone that turneth all to gold for that which god doth touch and own can not for less be told
emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering o'er the mountain 's brow there is a path on the sea 's azure floor no keel has ever plough 'd that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my heart 's sister wilt thou sail with me our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea treading each other 's heels unheededly it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remain 'd a solitude but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold the blue aegean girds this chosen home with ever-changing sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul—they seem like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle 'twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer wash 'd by the soft blue oceans of young air it is a favour 'd place famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountain-peaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the wingèd storms chanting their thunder-psalm to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality and from the sea there rise and from the sky there fall clear exhalations soft and bright veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isle 's beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen o'er the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic island-people know 'tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender ocean-king ere crime had been invented in the world 's young prime rear 'd it a wonder of that simple time an envy of the isles a pleasure-house made sacred to his sister and his spouse it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assum 'd its form then grown out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been eras 'd and in the place of it the ivy and the wild-vine interknit the volumes of their many-twining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winter-woof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen or fragments of the day 's intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one another 's arms and dream of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality this isle and house are mine and i have vow'd thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but can not die folded within their own eternity our simple life wants little and true taste hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill the ring-dove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her love-lament and the owls flit round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measur 'd by the pants of their calm sleep be this our home in life and when years heap their wither 'd hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one meanwhile we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour or linger where the pebble-paven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— possessing and possess 'd by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expir 'd night asleep through which the awaken 'd day can never peep a veil for our seclusion close as night 's where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again and we will talk until thought 's melody become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our being 's inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be confus 'd in passion 's golden purity as mountain-springs under the morning sun we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh wherefore two one passion in twin-hearts which grows and grew till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigur 'd ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one another 's substance finding food like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and can not pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation woe is me the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of love 's rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire— i pant i sink i tremble i expire
it ’ s a spring morning sun pours in the window as i sit here drinking coffee reading augustine and finding him as always newly minted from when i first encountered him in school today i ’ m overcome with astonishment at the way we girls denied all that was mean in those revered philosophers we studied who found us loathsome loathsomely seductive irrelevant at best to noble discourse among the sex the only sex that counted wounded we pretended not to mind it and wore tight sweaters to tease our shy professor we sat in autumn sunshine “ as the clouds arose from slimy desires of the flesh and from youth ’ s seething spring. ” thank you augustine attempting to seem blasé our cheeks on fire it didn ’ t occur to us to rush from the room instead we brushed aside “ the briars of unclean desire ” and struggled on through mires of misogyny till we arrived at kierkegaard and began to see that though saint a. and søren had much in common including fear and trembling before women the saint scared himself while søren was scared of us had we poor girls been flattered by their thralldom yes it was always us the rejected feminine from whom temptation came it was our flesh with its deadly sweetness that led them on yet how could we not treasure augustine “ stuck fast in the bird-lime of pleasure ” that roomful of adolescent poets manqué assuaged bemused by music let the meaning go swept by those psalmic cadences we were seduced some of us tried for a while to be well-trained souls and pious seekers enmeshed in the saint ’ s dialectic responsible for our actions yet utterly helpless a sensible girl would have barked like a dog before god we students children still were shocked to learn the children these men desired were younger than we augustine fancied a girl about eleven the age of adeodatus augustine ’ s son søren like poe eyed his girl before she was sixteen to impose his will on a malleable child when she was not equipped to withstand or understand him ah the pygmalion instinct mold the clay create the compliant doll that can only obey expecting to be abandoned minute by minute it was then i abandoned philosophy a minor loss although i majored in it but we were a group of sunny innocents i don ’ t believe we knew what evil meant now i live with a well-trained soul who deals with evil including error material or spiritual easily like changing a lock on the kitchen door he prays at set times and in chosen places at meals in church while i pray without thinking how or when to pray in a low mumble several times a day like running a continuous low fever the sexual impulse for the most part being over believing i believe not banking on it ever it ’ s afternoon i sit here drinking kir and reading kierkegaard “ all sin begins with fear. ” true we lie first from terror of our parents in i believe an oblique crack at augustine søren said by denying the erotic it was brought to the attention of the world the rainbow curtain rises on the sensual christians must admit it before they can deny it he reflected on his father ’ s fierce repression of the sexual which had bent him out of shape yet he had to pay obeisance to that power he chose his father when he broke with his regina søren said by denying the erotic it is brought to the attention of the world you must admit it before you can deny it so much for “ repetition ” —another theory which some assume evolved from his belief he could replay his courtship of regina with a happy ending meanwhile she ’ d wait for him eternally faithful eternally seventeen instead within two years the bitch got married in truth he couldn ’ t wait till he got rid of her to create from recollection not from living to use the material not the material girl i sip my kir thinking of either/or especially either starring poor elvira he must have seen giovanni a score of times and søren knew the score he took regina to the opera only once and as soon as mozart ’ s overture was over kierkegaard stood up and said “ now we are leaving you have heard the best the expectation of pleasure. ” in his interminable aria on the subject s.k insisted the performance was the play was the overture then the foreplay poor regina should have known she ’ d be left waiting in the lurch though he chose a disguise in which to rhapsodize it was his voice too elvira ’ s beauty would perish soon the deflowered quickly fade a night-blooming cereus after juan ’ s one-night stand søren eyes clouded by romantic mist portrayed elvira always sweet sixteen s.k. ’ s interpretation seems naive he didn ’ t seem to realize that innocent sopranos who are ready to sing elvira don ’ t exist his diva may have had it off with leporello just before curtain time believing it freed her voice so backstage legend has it and weakened his i saw la stupenda sing elvira once her cloak was larger than an army tent would giovanni be engulfed when she inhaled would the boards shiver when she stamped her foot her voice of course was great innocent it was not søren long since would have fallen in a faint when he or his doppelgänger wrote that best-seller “ the diary of a seducer ” he showed how little he knew of true don juans those turgid letters machinations and excursions those tedious conversations with dull aunts those convoluted efforts to get the girl think of the worldly european readers who took søren seriously did not see his was the cynicism of the timid virgin once in my youth i knew a real don juan or he knew me he didn ’ t need to try the characteristic of a true seducer he seems vulnerable shy he hardly speaks somehow you know he will never speak of you you trust him—and you thrust yourself at him he responds with an almost absentminded grace even before the consummation he ’ s looking past you for the next bright yearning pretty face relieved at last of anxieties and tensions when your terrible efforts to capture him are over you overflow with happy/unhappy languor but s.k ’ s alter-ego believes the truly terrible is for you to be consoled by the love of another we women deserted to a woman have a duty to rapidly lose our looks decline and die our only chance of achieving romantic beauty so augustine was sure when monica his mother made him put aside his nameless concubine she ’ d get her to a nunnery and pine he chose his mother when he broke with his beloved in søren ’ s long replay of his wrecked romance “ guilty/not guilty ” he says he must tear himself away from earthly love and suffer to love god augustine thought better love human therefore flawed is the way to the love of god to deny this truth is to be “ left outside breathing into the dust filling the eyes with earth. ” we women outside breathing dust are still the other the evening sun goes down time to fix dinner “ you women have no major philosophers. ” we know but we remain philosophic and say with the saint “ let me enter my chamber and sing my songs of love ”
in the valley of your art history book the corpses stack in the back of a cart drawn by an ox whose rolling shoulder muscles show its considerable weight he does this often his velvet nostrils flare to indicate the stench it ’ s the smell you catch after class while descending a urine-soaked subway stair on a summer night in a neighborhood where cabs won ’ t drive the odor of dead flowers fear multiplied a thousand times the train door ’ s hiss seals you inside with a frail boy swaying from a silver hoop he coughs in your direction his eyes are burn holes in his face back in the fourteenth-century print lying in your lap a hand white as an orchid has sprouted from the pyramid of flesh it claws the smoky air were it not for that the cart might carry green cordwood the human body knobby and unplaned wrap your fingers around your neck and feel the stony glands count the holes in your belt loop for lost weight in the black unfurling glass study the hard planes of your face compare it to the prom picture in your wallet the orchid pinned to your chest like a spider think of the flames at your high school bonfire licking the black sky ashes rising innumerable stars the fingers that wove with your fingers have somehow turned to bone the subway shudders between dark and light the ox plods across the page think of everyone you ever loved the boy who gets off at your stop is a faint ideogram for each offer him your hand help him climb the stair

clothes torn my hair in a wad my bare feet bleeding i had started the buffalo grass in the new-made clearing the next day the priest paid a visit civil but restless i was dying to plant the alfalfa seed—gave him a packet that evening i paced up and down dropping melon seeds tomatoes and bush lima beans here and there where i thought they would grow we were short of food now so i cooked up a mess

for more seeds i clean out the potatoes which had rotted in their hills of course rls is not idle he is writing a footnote to history how the great powers combine to carve up these islands i

... it nearly made me ill. breadfruit is plentiful i found a banana grove began clearing it instantly and worked till i was dizzy the garden looks like a graveyard beds shaped like tombs i plant cabbage which i loathe so the british won ’ t tease me for not growing it but behold in the hedge among citron and lime many lemon trees in full bearing still i will fall to brooding before the mirror

james mr. carruthers ’ gift pineapple starts to fruit i set out one precious rhubarb plant pause to gloat at the ripe tomatoes the flourishing long-podded beans but the neighbors ’ horses break in and trample the corn sometimes when planting a strange subterranean rumble —volcanic —vexes the earth beneath this peasant haunch i rise up from my furrow knuckle smooth my brow as i sniff the air suddenly chemical a sulphurous fume louis insisted on going to sydney fell ill again his mother comes back with him finds me on my knees the old lady ’ s heart leaps alas i am planting not praying we both rise at five-thirty after dreaming of weeds louis describes to me endless vivid deeps dreams of nettle-stings stabs from the citron ’ s thorns the ants ’ fiery bites the resistance of mud and slime the evasions of wormy roots the dead weight of heat in the sudden puffs of air ... louis writes till nine then if he ’ s well enough he helps with the weeding he writes colvin keeper of prints at the british museum “ i know pleasure still ... with a thousand faces none perfect a thousand tongues all broken a thousand hands all with scratching nails ... high among joys i place this delight of weeding out here alone by the garrulous water under the silence of the high wind broken by sounds of birds. ” the shock of bird-calls laughing and whistling they mimic his name till it seems he says “ the birds re-live the business of my day. ” but the rain continues to fall on birds and weeds the new servants fooled around with the ice machine as the house leaked and listed mildew spread its failure mrs. s. gave me some nuts and went back to australia green peppers eggplant tomatoes are flourishing asparagus also the celery does to season soup avocados grow at a rate that is almost

haggard the land commissioner come to dine points out a weed which makes excellent eating cooked like asparagus i shall try it very soon now when the reverend mr. claxton comes to call i refuse to see him i am tired of the claxtons the political situation grows grim i rage at louis who toasts “ her blessed majesty the queen ” then aggressively throbbing turns to my american son to say he may drink to the president afterward if he likes i am writing this down hoping louis will see it later and be ashamed of his childishness and bad taste this will be erased because war is near the germans stop

in a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland at the sea-down 's edge between windward and lee walled round with rocks as an inland island the ghost of a garden fronts the sea a girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses the steep square slope of the blossomless bed where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses now lie dead the fields fall southward abrupt and broken to the low last edge of the long lone land if a step should sound or a word be spoken would a ghost not rise at the strange guest 's hand so long have the grey bare walks lain guestless through branches and briars if a man make way he shall find no life but the sea-wind 's restless night and day the dense hard passage is blind and stifled that crawls by a track none turn to climb to the strait waste place that the years have rifled of all but the thorns that are touched not of time the thorns he spares when the rose is taken the rocks are left when he wastes the plain the wind that wanders the weeds wind-shaken these remain not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not as the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry from the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not could she call there were never a rose to reply over the meadows that blossom and wither rings but the note of a sea-bird 's song only the sun and the rain come hither all year long the sun burns sere and the rain dishevels one gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath only the wind here hovers and revels in a round where life seems barren as death here there was laughing of old there was weeping haply of lovers none ever will know whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping years ago heart handfast in heart as they stood `` look thither '' did he whisper `` look forth from the flowers to the sea for the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither and men that love lightly may die—but we '' and the same wind sang and the same waves whitened and or ever the garden 's last petals were shed in the lips that had whispered the eyes that had lightened love was dead or they loved their life through and then went whither and were one to the end—but what end who knows love deep as the sea as a rose must wither as the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them what love was ever as deep as a grave they are loveless now as the grass above them or the wave all are at one now roses and lovers not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea not a breath of the time that has been hovers in the air now soft with a summer to be not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep when as they that are free now of weeping and laughter we shall sleep here death may deal not again for ever here change may come not till all change end from the graves they have made they shall rise up never who have left nought living to ravage and rend earth stones and thorns of the wild ground growing while the sun and the rain live these shall be till a last wind 's breath upon all these blowing roll the sea till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble the fields that lessen the rocks that shrink here now in his triumph where all things falter stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread as a god self-slain on his own strange altar death lies dead

on a road through the mountains with a friend many years ago i came to a curve on a slope where a clear stream flowed down flashing across dark rocks through its own echoes that could neither be caught nor forgotten it was the turning of autumn and already the mornings were cold with ragged clouds in the hollows long after sunrise but the pasture sagging like a roof the glassy water and flickering yellow leaves in the few poplars and knotted plum trees were held up in a handful of sunlight that made the slates on the silent mill by the stream glisten white above their ruin and a few relics of the life before had been arranged in front of the open mill house to wait pale in the daylight out on the open mountain after whatever they had been made for was over the dew was drying on them and there were few who took that road who might buy one of them and take it away somewhere to be unusual to be the only one to become unknown a wooden bed stood there on rocks a cradle the color of dust a cracked oil jar iron pots wooden wheels iron wheels stone wheels the tall box of a clock and among them a ring of white stone the size of an embrace set into another of the same size an iron spike rising from the ring where the wooden handle had fitted that turned it in its days as a hand mill you could see if you looked closely that the top ring that turned in the other had been carved long before in the form of a fox lying nose in tail seeming to be asleep the features worn almost away where it had gone around and around grinding grain and salt to go into the dark and to go on and remember what i thought i had left i kept finding again but when i went looking for what i thought i remembered as anyone could have foretold it was not there when i went away looking for what i had to do i found that i was living where i was a stranger but when i retraced my steps the familiar vision turned opaque and all surface and in the wrong places and the places where i had been a stranger appeared to me to be where i had been at home called by name and answering getting ready to go away and going away every time they assembled and he spoke to them about waking there was an old man who stood listening and left before the others until one day the old man stayed and who are you he asked the old man and the old man answered i am not a man many lives ago i stood where you are standing and they assembled in front of me and i spoke to them about waking until one day one of them asked me when someone has wakened to what is really there is that person free of the chain of consequences and i answered yes and with that i turned into a fox and i have been a fox for five hundred lives and now i have come to ask you to say what will free me from the body of a fox please tell me when someone has wakened to what is really there is that person free of the chain of consequences and this time the answer was that person sees it as it is then the old man said thank you for waking me you have set me free of the body of the fox which you will find on the other side of the mountain i ask you to bury it please as one of your own that evening he announced a funeral service for one of them but they said nobody has died then he led them to the other side of the mountain and a cave where they found a fox ’ s body and he told them the story and they buried the fox as one of them but later one of them asked what if he had given the right answer every time once again i was there and once again i was leaving and again it seemed as though nothing had changed even while it was all changing but this time was a time of ending this time the long marriage was over the orbits were flying apart it was autumn again sunlight tawny in the fields where the shadows each day grew longer and the still afternoons ripened the distance until the sun went down across the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees it was the time of year when i was born and that evening i went to see friends for the last time and i came back after midnight along the road white with the moon i was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me the wide silent valley full of silver light and there just at the corner of the land that i had come back to so many times and now was leaving at the foot of the wall built of pale stone i saw the body stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished i carried her home to bury her in the garden in the morning of the clear autumn that she had left and to stand afterward in the turning daylight there are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags of dried irises knuckled into the hollows of moss and rubbly limestone on the waves of the low wall the ivy has climbed along them where the weasel ran the light has kindled to gold the late leaves of the cherry tree over the lane by the house chimney there is the roof and the window looking out over the garden summer and winter there is the field below the house there is the broad valley far below them all with the curves of the river a strand of sky threaded through it and the notes of bells rising out of it faint as smoke and there beyond the valley above the rim of the wall the line of mountains i recognize like a line of writing that has come back when i had thought it was forgotten

from blossoms comes this brown paper bag of peaches we bought from the boy at the bend in the road where we turned toward signs painted peaches from laden boughs from hands from sweet fellowship in the bins comes nectar at the roadside succulent peaches we devour dusty skin and all comes the familiar dust of summer dust we eat o to take what we love inside to carry within us an orchard to eat not only the skin but the shade not only the sugar but the days to hold the fruit in our hands adore it then bite into the round jubilance of peach there are days we live as if death were nowhere in the background from joy to joy to joy from wing to wing from blossom to blossom to impossible blossom to sweet impossible blossom
i. when his dogs leapt on actaeon he cried did he cry out —he flung his arm to command they tore his hand from the wrist stump tore guts from his belly through the tunic ripped the cry from his throat that ’ s how we know a god when the facts leap at the tenderest innards and we know the god is what we can ’ t change you stood over me as i woke i opened my eyes i saw that i ’ d seen and that it was too late the seeing of you in the doorway with weak electric light fanning behind you in the hall and my room and narrow pallet steeped in shadow were what i couldn ’ t change and distantly i wanted you and as distantly i heard the dogs baying ii and yet the fountain spends itself and it is in the clear light of its losing that we seem to take delight you dipped your hand in its running braid to sprinkle my forehead my lips garden deities observed us three nymphs with moss staining their haunches a pug-nosed faun the wound in water closed perfectly around your gesture erasing it so that only the glimmer swiftly drying on my face recalled our interruption of the faultless cold passionate perpetual idea of the stream ’ s descent— which unlike ours would always be renewed iii i kissed a flame what did i expect those days you painted in fire tangerine gold one would have had to be a pilgrim to walk through that wall of molten glass and purification could be conceived if not attained only after many years in autumn in a fire greater than yours though menstrual blood still tinged the threshold and our ex-votos were sordid—scraps of blistered flesh taped to kitsch prayer cards—and neither of us knew the object of this exercise except having inadvertently each of us burned we recognized the smell of wood smoke the slow swirl flakes of wood ash make in heavy air and we were ready each in a private way to make the gifts the season required mine was the scene of my young self in your arms eyes in your eyes clutched in the effort to give each other away—when i glimpsed behind your pleasure fear behind fear anger and knew in a bolt some gifts conceal a greater gift i have kept it now i am ready to give it back into darker flame in this season of goldenrod the ardent weed and queen anne ’ s lace in its mantilla of ash and yet how lumpishly how stupidly i stand how much that is human will never burn iv and if you should answer i listened years before i knew you to the whine of wind through the high stony pastures above my childhood village i breathed lavender and thyme and burned my bare legs on nettles scraped them on thistles and rubbed the sore skin till it reddened all the more when we walked the uplands together you burned your hand and i kissed the crimsoning nettle-rash “ we are the lords of need ” you said hafiz said and i believed you and we were in the rugs of your country carmine is crushed from insects cochineal saffron gold is boiled from crocus stamens and indigo of heaven and fountain pools is soaked hours upon hours from indigo leaves “ like the angel harut ” you said “ we are in the calamity of love-desire. ” the angel is chained by neck and knees head down in the pit of babel for falling in love your carpets told a different story scarlet and saffron blush as in paradise and god reveals himself in wine flame tulips and the light in a mortal eye all night you held me sleepless on my childhood cot in the stone house all night the wind seethed through crags and twisted olive trees high on the scents of thyme and goat droppings “ all night ” hafiz sang “ i hope the breeze of dawn will cherish the lovers. ” but the breeze of dawn is the angel of death you are in your far landscape now i am in mine the wind complains and i can ’ t understand the words and if you should answer you ten years away in a different wind “ we are in the calamity ” hafiz sang “ but tell the tale of the minstrel and of wine and leave time alone time is a mystery no skill will solve. ” we should thread words like pearls you said and the grateful sky would scatter the pleiades upon us though we couldn ’ t see and that was long ago v. the carpet is not a story it is a place garden of crisscrossed pathways labyrinth fountain pool and stream as though the fabric had ripped at the vanishing point at the top of the street of ashen façades and slate-sloped roofs you stepped through the gap out of your own world i had already lost my world we met in a torn design which we tore further pulling the tall warp thread wrapped tightly around our fingers until it bit the flesh and the rue de lille unravelled i know about design it ’ s my job arranging other people ’ s letters in star charts that phosphoresce in the dark between the closed covers of books you knew about design from the holes blown through your country we spoke in a language of no country on earth you moved slowly in shadow teaching the shadows to echo my name you ripped my shirt at the neck was it the beloved i held holding you down the middle of the carpet the river weaves a thousand gray glimmers into the deeper green the river knows about mourning that ’ s its job how many years has it practiced with such fleet fingers a man woke me at dawn this morning sobbing and cursing in the street reeling from sidewalk to gutter and back again on my long gray street the rue de lille where i still live
the frost performs its secret ministry unhelped by any wind the owlet 's cry came loud—and hark again loud as before the inmates of my cottage all at rest have left me to that solitude which suits abstruser musings save that at my side my cradled infant slumbers peacefully 't is calm indeed so calm that it disturbs and vexes meditation with its strange and extreme silentness sea hill and wood this populous village sea and hill and wood with all the numberless goings-on of life inaudible as dreams the thin blue flame lies on my low-burnt fire and quivers not only that film which fluttered on the grate still flutters there the sole unquiet thing methinks its motion in this hush of nature gives it dim sympathies with me who live making it a companionable form whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirit by its own moods interprets every where echo or mirror seeking of itself and makes a toy of thought but o how oft how oft at school with most believing mind presageful have i gazed upon the bars to watch that fluttering stranger and as oft with unclosed lids already had i dreamt of my sweet birth-place and the old church-tower whose bells the poor man 's only music rang from morn to evening all the hot fair-day so sweetly that they stirred and haunted me with a wild pleasure falling on mine ear most like articulate sounds of things to come so gazed i till the soothing things i dreamt lulled me to sleep and sleep prolonged my dreams and so i brooded all the following morn awed by the stern preceptor 's face mine eye fixed with mock study on my swimming book save if the door half opened and i snatched a hasty glance and still my heart leaped up for still i hoped to see the stranger 's face townsman or aunt or sister more beloved my play-mate when we both were clothed alike dear babe that sleepest cradled by my side whose gentle breathings heard in this deep calm fill up the intersperséd vacancies and momentary pauses of the thought my babe so beautiful it thrills my heart with tender gladness thus to look at thee and think that thou shalt learn far other lore and in far other scenes for i was reared in the great city pent 'mid cloisters dim and saw nought lovely but the sky and stars but thou my babe shalt wander like a breeze by lakes and sandy shores beneath the crags of ancient mountain and beneath the clouds which image in their bulk both lakes and shores and mountain crags so shalt thou see and hear the lovely shapes and sounds intelligible of that eternal language which thy god utters who from eternity doth teach himself in all and all things in himself great universal teacher he shall mould thy spirit and by giving make it ask therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee whether the summer clothe the general earth with greenness or the redbreast sit and sing betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch of mossy apple-tree while the night-thatch smokes in the sun-thaw whether the eave-drops fall heard only in the trances of the blast or if the secret ministry of frost shall hang them up in silent icicles quietly shining to the quiet moon
mother is drinking to forget a man who could fill the woods with invitations come with me he whispered and she went in his nash rambler its dash where her knees turned green in the radium dials of the 50 's when i drink it is always 1953 bacon wilting in the pan on cook street and mother wrist deep in red water laying a trail from the sink to a glass of gin and back she is a beautiful unlucky woman in love with a man of lechery so solid you could build a table on it and when you did the blues would come to visit i remember all of us awkwardly at dinner the dark slung across the porch and then mother ’ s dress falling to the floor buttons ticking like seeds spit on a plate when i drink i am too much like her— the knife in one hand and the trout with a belly white as my wrist i have loved you all my life she told him and it was true in the same way that all her life she drank dedicated to the act itself she stood at this stove and with the care of the very drunk handed him the plate
you would think the fury of aerial bombardment would rouse god to relent the infinite spaces are still silent he looks on shock-pried faces history even does not know what is meant you would feel that after so many centuries god would give man to repent yet he can kill as cain could but with multitudinous will no farther advanced than in his ancient furies was man made stupid to see his own stupidity is god by definition indifferent beyond us all is the eternal truth man ’ s fighting soul wherein the beast ravens in its own avidity of van wettering i speak and averill names on a list whose faces i do not recall but they are gone to early death who late in school distinguished the belt feed lever from the belt holding pawl

after pavese under the trellised arbor and our supper ’ s over in the memory i ’ ve found myself inside l not speaking and beside us the river sliding softly by now the light will fade to moonlit water and in memory i work to make this lingering accurate and sweet white ouzo and her hand that lifts the grapes first to her lips then to mine i may as well speak to moonlight as to her and the walls of bruges light up again a costume jewelry pearl string her profile and her shawl hugged tight against the breeze in memory ’ s flammable celluloid—flaring and gone replaced by bread and grapes a checkered tablecloth the two chairs stare each other down empty now upon which moonlight flickered all night the bread and grapes drip mist as dawn carves the morning with a chilly wind slicing away both moon and fog now someone without a name appears—first the fevered hands dustdevil quick that grope for the food in vain then the pale light shows the open mouth and rippling throat white face on black water sparrow-flock fast its spiraling path but the bread and grapes stay where they were their smell tormenting that famished ghost helpless to even lick away the dew that gathers on the grapes blue fluted sides of the wineglasses dawnlight everything dripping wet and the chairs stare at each other alone sometimes on the riverbank you can sense an odor—of grapes or sex or memory it swirls through the moonlit grass and now wakes someone always mute someone without a body weaving also through the half-lit grass the hoarse wail of someone who can not speak who reaches out but can not touch the grass and only the nostrils flare now the dawn will break late autumn cold to crave so endlessly the warmth— the blood-pulsing fingertip the body to embrace the pungent smells commingling to rise like breath and slither through the trees and tangle every branch in this unappeasable longing this endless lust for touch and smell which afflicts the dead the souls in the trees face the gathering light other times in the ground the rain torments them

glen “ oh ” cried lizzie “ laura laura you should not peep at goblin men. ” lizzie cover ’ d up her eyes cover ’ d close lest they should look laura rear ’ d her glossy head and whisper ’ d like the restless brook “ look lizzie look lizzie down the glen tramp little men one hauls a basket one bears a plate one lugs a golden dish of many pounds weight how fair the vine must grow whose grapes are so luscious how warm the wind must blow through those fruit bushes. ” “ no ” said lizzie “ no no no their offers should not charm us their evil gifts would harm us. ” she thrust a dimpled finger in

turn ’ d and troop ’ d the goblin men with their shrill repeated cry “ come buy come buy. ” when they reach ’ d where laura was they stood stock still upon the moss leering at each other brother with queer brother signalling each other brother with sly brother one set his basket down one rear ’ d his plate one began to weave a crown of tendrils leaves and rough nuts brown men sell not such in any

nay hush ” said laura “ nay hush my sister i ate and ate my fill yet my mouth waters still to-morrow night i will buy more ” and kiss ’ d her “ have done with sorrow i ’ ll bring you plums to-morrow fresh on their mother twigs cherries worth getting you can not think what figs my teeth have met in what melons icy-cold piled on a dish of gold too huge for me to hold what peaches with a velvet nap pellucid grapes without one seed odorous indeed must be the mead whereon they grow and pure the wave they drink with lilies at the brink and sugar-sweet their sap. ” golden head by golden head like two pigeons in one nest folded in each other ’ s wings they lay down in their curtain ’ d bed like two blossoms on one stem like two flakes of new-fall ’ n snow like two wands of ivory tipp ’ d with

the reedy brook lizzie most placid in her look laura most like a leaping flame they drew the gurgling water from its deep lizzie pluck ’ d purple and rich golden flags then turning homeward said “ the sunset flushes those furthest loftiest crags come laura not another maiden lags no wilful squirrel wags the beasts and birds are fast asleep. ” but laura loiter ’ d still among the rushes and said the bank was steep and said the hour was early still the dew not fall ’ n the wind not chill listening ever but not catching the customary cry “ come buy come buy ” with its iterated jingle of sugar-baited words not for all her watching once discerning even one goblin racing whisking tumbling hobbling let alone the herds that used to tramp along the glen in groups or single of brisk fruit-merchant men till lizzie urged “ o laura come i hear the fruit-call but i dare not look you should not loiter longer at this brook come with me home the stars rise the moon bends her arc each glowworm winks her spark let us get home before the night grows dark for clouds may gather though this is summer weather put out the lights and drench us through then if we lost our way what should we do ” laura turn ’ d cold as stone to find her sister heard that cry alone that goblin cry “ come buy our fruits come buy. ” must she then buy no more such dainty fruit must she no more such succous pasture find gone deaf and blind her tree of life droop ’ d from the root she said not one word in her heart ’ s sore ache but peering thro ’ the dimness nought discerning trudg ’ d home her pitcher dripping all the way so crept to bed and lay silent till lizzie slept then sat up in a passionate yearning and gnash ’ d her teeth for baulk ’ d desire and wept as if her heart would break day after day night after night laura kept watch in vain in sullen silence of exceeding pain she never caught again the goblin cry “ come buy come buy ” — she never spied the goblin men hawking their fruits along the glen but when the noon wax ’ d bright her hair grew thin and grey she dwindled as the fair full moon doth turn to swift decay and burn her fire away one day remembering her kernel-stone she set it by a wall that faced the south dew ’ d it with tears hoped for a root watch ’ d for a waxing shoot but there came none it never saw the sun it never felt the trickling moisture run while with sunk eyes and faded mouth she dream ’ d of melons as a traveller sees false waves in desert drouth with shade of leaf-crown ’ d trees and burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze she no more swept the house tended the fowls or cows fetch ’ d honey kneaded cakes of wheat brought water from the brook but sat down listless in the chimney-nook and would not eat tender lizzie could not bear to watch her sister ’ s cankerous care yet not to share she night and morning caught the goblins ’ cry “ come buy our orchard fruits come buy come buy ” — beside the brook along the glen she heard the tramp of goblin men the yoke and stir poor laura could not hear long ’ d to buy fruit to comfort her but fear ’ d to pay too dear she thought of jeanie in her grave who should have been a bride but who for joys brides hope to have fell sick and died in her gay prime in earliest winter time with the first glazing rime with the first snow-fall of crisp winter time till laura dwindling seem ’ d knocking at death ’ s door then lizzie weigh ’ d no more better and worse but put a silver penny in her purse kiss ’ d laura cross ’ d the heath with clumps of furze at twilight halted by the brook and for the first time in her life began to listen and look laugh ’ d every goblin when they spied her peeping came towards her hobbling flying running leaping puffing and blowing chuckling clapping crowing clucking and gobbling mopping and mowing full of airs and graces pulling wry faces demure grimaces cat-like and rat-like ratel- and wombat-like snail-paced in a hurry parrot-voiced and whistler helter skelter hurry skurry chattering like magpies fluttering like pigeons gliding like fishes — hugg ’ d her and kiss ’ d her squeez ’ d and caress ’ d her stretch ’ d up their dishes panniers and plates “ look at our apples russet and dun bob at our cherries bite at our peaches citrons and dates grapes for the asking pears red with basking out in the sun plums on their twigs pluck them and suck them pomegranates figs. ” — “ good folk ” said lizzie mindful of jeanie “ give me much and many — held out her apron toss ’ d them her penny “ nay take a seat with us honour and eat with us ” they answer ’ d grinning “ our feast is but beginning night yet is early warm and dew-pearly wakeful and starry such fruits as these no man can carry half their bloom would fly half their dew would dry half their flavour would pass by sit down and feast with us be welcome guest with us cheer you and rest with us. ” — “ thank you ” said lizzie “ but one waits at home alone for me so without further parleying if you will not sell me any of your fruits though much and many give me back my silver penny i toss ’ d you for a fee. ” — they began to scratch their pates no longer wagging purring but visibly demurring grunting and snarling one call ’ d her proud cross-grain ’ d uncivil their tones wax ’ d loud their looks were evil lashing their tails they trod and hustled her elbow ’ d and jostled her claw ’ d with their nails barking mewing hissing mocking tore her gown and soil ’ d her stocking twitch ’ d her hair out by the roots stamp ’ d upon her tender feet held her hands and squeez ’ d their fruits against her mouth to make her eat white and golden lizzie stood like a lily in a flood — like a rock of blue-vein ’ d stone lash ’ d by tides obstreperously — like a beacon left alone in a hoary roaring sea sending up a golden fire — like a fruit-crown ’ d orange-tree white with blossoms honey-sweet sore beset by wasp and bee — like a royal virgin town topp ’ d with gilded dome and spire close beleaguer ’ d by a fleet mad to tug her standard down one may lead a horse to water twenty can not make him drink though the goblins cuff ’ d and caught her coax ’ d and fought her bullied and besought her scratch ’ d her pinch ’ d her black as ink kick ’ d and knock ’ d her maul ’ d and mock ’ d her lizzie utter ’ d not a word would not open lip from lip lest they should cram a mouthful in but laugh ’ d in heart to feel the drip of juice that syrupp ’ d all her face and lodg ’ d in dimples of her chin and streak ’ d her neck which quaked like curd at last the evil people worn out by her resistance flung back her penny kick ’ d their fruit along whichever road they took not leaving root or stone or shoot some writh ’ d into the ground some div ’ d into the brook with ring and ripple some scudded on the gale without a sound some vanish ’ d in the distance in a smart ache tingle lizzie went her way knew not was it night or day sprang up the bank tore thro ’ the furze threaded copse and dingle and heard her penny jingle bouncing in her purse — its bounce was music to her ear she ran and ran as if she fear ’ d some goblin man dogg ’ d her with gibe or curse or something worse but not one goblin scurried after nor was she prick ’ d by fear the kind heart made her windy-paced that urged her home quite out of breath with haste and inward laughter she cried “ laura ” up the garden “ did you miss me come and kiss me never mind my bruises hug me kiss me suck my juices squeez ’ d from goblin fruits for you goblin pulp and goblin dew eat me drink me love me laura make much of me for your sake i have braved the glen and had to do with goblin merchant men. ” laura started from her chair flung her arms up in the air clutch ’ d her hair “ lizzie lizzie have you tasted for my sake the fruit forbidden must your light like mine be hidden your young life like mine be wasted undone in mine undoing and ruin ’ d in my ruin thirsty canker ’ d goblin-ridden ” — she clung about her sister kiss ’ d and kiss ’ d and kiss ’ d her tears once again refresh ’ d her shrunken eyes dropping like rain after long sultry drouth shaking with aguish fear and pain she kiss ’ d and kiss ’ d her with a hungry mouth her lips began to scorch that juice was wormwood to her tongue she loath ’ d the feast writhing as one possess ’ d she leap ’ d and sung rent all her robe and wrung her hands in lamentable haste and beat her breast her locks stream ’ d like the torch borne by a racer at full speed or like the mane of horses in their flight or like an eagle when she stems the light straight toward the sun or like a caged thing freed or like a flying flag when armies run swift fire spread through her veins knock ’ d at her heart met the fire smouldering there and overbore its lesser flame she gorged on bitterness without a name ah fool to choose such part of soul-consuming care sense fail ’ d in the mortal strife like the watch-tower of a town which an earthquake shatters down like a lightning-stricken mast like a wind-uprooted tree spun about like a foam-topp ’ d waterspout cast down headlong in the sea she fell at last pleasure past and anguish past is it death or is it life life out of death that night long lizzie watch ’ d by her counted her pulse ’ s flagging stir felt for her breath held water to her lips and cool ’ d her face with tears and fanning leaves but when the first birds chirp ’ d about their eaves and early reapers plodded to the place of golden sheaves and dew-wet grass bow ’ d in the morning winds so brisk to pass and new buds with new day open ’ d of cup-like lilies on the stream laura awoke as from a dream laugh ’ d in the innocent old way hugg ’ d lizzie but not twice or thrice her gleaming locks show ’ d not one thread of grey her breath was sweet as may and light danced in her eyes days weeks months years afterwards when both were wives with children of their own their mother-hearts beset with fears their lives bound up in tender lives laura would call the little ones and tell them of her early prime those pleasant days long gone of not-returning time would talk about the haunted glen the wicked quaint fruit-merchant men their fruits like honey to the throat but poison in the blood men sell not such in any town would tell them how her sister stood in deadly peril to do her good and win the fiery antidote then joining hands to little hands would bid them cling together “ for there is no friend like a sister in calm or stormy weather to cheer one on the tedious way to fetch one if one goes astray to lift one if one totters down to strengthen whilst one stands ”

this saying good-bye on the edge of the dark and cold to an orchard so young in the bark reminds me of all that can happen to harm an orchard away at the end of the farm all winter cut off by a hill from the house i do n't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse i do n't want it dreamily nibbled for browse by deer and i do n't want it budded by grouse if certain it would n't be idle to call i 'd summon grouse rabbit and deer to the wall and warn them away with a stick for a gun i do n't want it stirred by the heat of the sun we made it secure against being i hope by setting it out on a northerly slope no orchard 's the worse for the wintriest storm but one thing about it it must n't get warm `` how often already you 've had to be told keep cold young orchard good-bye and keep cold dread fifty above more than fifty below '' i have to be gone for a season or so my business awhile is with different trees less carefully nourished less fruitful than these and such as is done to their wood with an axe— maples and birches and tamaracks i wish i could promise to lie in the night and think of an orchard 's arboreal plight when slowly and nobody comes with a light its heart sinks lower under the sod but something has to be left to god
framed by our window skaters winding in and out the wind as water reeling so kept in motion on a well-honed edge spin out a gilded ceiling fish reflecting glow for glow saints around the sun are frozen with amazement just one pane below skates flash like stars so madly whirling one can hardly tell which is sky and which the watery floor ... one night two straitlaced couples a footman over them rode out in a dappled-horse-drawn sleigh onto the river a moonlit lark the ice broke and they—sleigh footman and all—riding in state rode straight on into the lidded water that winter all winter folks twirled over them who—framed in lace frost the furs the shiny harness and their smiles the fire that keeps the place—sat benignly watching “ one foot out one foot in are we real ” thought one “ we who wander sheepishly in dreams or they the really sleepless eyes under us and every night who knows a laughter troubles us like dreams who skates a thousand watch fires the stars above peering through the pane ”
we suffer from the repression of the sublime —roberto assagioli this artist ’ s sculptured open box of mahogany ivory white inside is strung with vertical and horizontal layers of mus- ical wires that sing when struck and bits of bright garnet rock tremble where they intersect these gems flash in the candle light and before me all my beloved childhood looms up in the humming levels each one deeper than the other i tip this sculpted box and my child laughs and moves there in his own time you ’ ll hear me moan oh you will hear me moan with all the old sure pleasure of what i ’ d thought i ’ d lost come back again why we have never left our home on the leather lace fixed about my neck blue yellow red and black african trading beads begin to glow their colors all weave and newly flow together like translucent and angelic worms and beneath these my neck is as alive with gentle white bees as is a woman ’ s breast beside and in the light river figures come on stage exactly as they are needed i tell you i conduct my own act a boy poses so youthfully so beautifully his slim arms a graceful arrow over his small brown head and he dives limbs and body push supple as a whole school of fish and then his vacant place is taken by another— a man dressed in denim and in boots of red rubber he is wrenched from the shore and pulled through the fresh bright stream by a kid who tugs on one of his hands and holds a fishing rod and too this man is dragged in the opposite direction by a red dog on a leash shaking his wet great coat into the stippled light that man just sashayed he zigzagged this way and that the man is me a bluejay does a dance for us he hops beside a tree that rises inside of me he half-glides his iridescent blue back striking like a brush of gauguin on the bare canvas of the air and then he flies leaving behind him a small perfect feather which i find shades from blue to brown— my brother ’ s color into mine now in the space the diver and the booted fellow left my brother and i are there fishing together our poles glinting in the water my mouth moves my eyes are alive i cry to my brother with joy for that bluejay was a messenger of what i want gregory my friend and guide on this voyage seems benign he brushes my chest and my stretched naked arms open to the sun with a branch of the fragrant pine “ be healed ” he chants with each glancing stroke “ be healed. ” the needles prick my skin back into life and i go down to bathe my feet in the stream the veins form a light mottled web along my white ankle i feel my kinship with the pine the jay the luminescent stream and with him—or is it with her the mother gregory my oracle my teacher he leans there in the door of our tent by the river his face glowing hair long and shining as a woman ’ s his belly fat with life—pregnant with the two of us my brother and i unborn twins who lie entangled in each other ’ s developing limbs soon we will be born he and i will taste of milk for the very first time and taste of strawberry pop and of bright bananas and we will eat my brother and i a great shining autumn-red apple fallen from our father ’ s tree as if from the long sky and you too will taste this apple with us for we all have the same mother and her name is grace

back when it took all day to come up from the curving broad ponds on the plains where the green-winged jaçanas ran on the lily pads easing past tracks at the mouths of gorges crossing villages silted in hollows in the foothills each with its lime-washed church by the baked square of red earth and its talkers eating fruit under trees turning a corner and catching sight at last of inky forests far above steep as faces with the clouds stroking them and the glimmering airy valleys opening out of them waterfalls still roared from the folds of the mountain white and thundering and spray drifted around us swirling into the broad leaves and the waiting boughs once i took a tin cup and climbed the sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside one of the high falls looking up step by step into the green sky from which rain was falling when i looked back from a ledge there were only dripping leaves below me and flowers beside me the hissing cataract plunged into the trees holding on i moved closer left foot on a rock in the water right foot on a rock in deeper water at the edge of the fall then from under the weight of my right foot came a voice like a small bell singing over and over one clear treble syllable i could feel it move i could feel it ring in my foot in my skin everywhere in my ears in my hair i could feel it in my tongue and in the hand holding the cup as long as i stood there it went on without changing when i moved the cup still it went on when i filled the cup in the falling column still it went on when i drank it rang in my eyes through the thunder curtain when i filled the cup again when i raised my foot still it went on and all the way down from wet rock to wet rock green branch to green branch it came with me until i stood looking up and we drank the light water and when we went on we could still hear the sound as far as the next turn on the way over

i saluted the famous river as i do every year turning south as if the plough steered kicking at the start of a new furrow my back to the shady purple gardens with benches under plum trees by the river that hunts between piers and sandbanks— i began threading the long bridge i bowed my head and lifted my hands from the wheel for an instant of trust i faced the long rows of vines curving up the hillside lightly like feathers and longer than the swallow ’ s flight my road already traced before me in a dance of three nights and three days of sidestepping hills and crescent lights blinding me if there was just a bar counter and ice and a glass and a room upstairs but it rushed past me and how many early starts before the morning when the looped passes descend to the ruined arch she came rising up out of the water her eyes were like sandbanks the wrinkles in her forehead were like the flaws in the mist maybe a long narrow boat with a man lying down and a rod and line like a frond of hair dipping in the stream she was humming the song about the estuary and the delights of a salt ocean the lighthouse like a summons and she told me the land will not go to that measure it lasts you ’ ll see how the earth widens and mountains are empty only with tracks that search and dip from here to the city of rome where the road gallops up to the dome as big as the sun you will see your sister going ahead of you and she will not need to rest but you must lie in the dry air of your hotel where the traffic grinds before dawn the cello changing gear at the foot of the long hill and think of the story of the suitors on horseback getting ready to trample up the mountain of glass

they said i got away in a boat and humbled me at the inquiry i tell you i sank as far that night as any hero as i sat shivering on the dark water i turned to ice to hear my costly life go thundering down in a pandemonium of prams pianos sideboards winches boilers bursting and shredded ragtime now i hide in a lonely house behind the sea where the tide leaves broken toys and hatboxes silently at my door the showers of april flowers of may mean nothing to me nor the late light of june when my gardener describes to strangers how the old man stays in bed on seaward mornings after nights of wind takes his cocaine and will see no one then it is i drown again with all those dim lost faces i never understood my poor soul screams out in the starlight heart breaks loose and rolls down like a stone include me in your lamentations
for james simmons 1 i wake in a dark flat to the soft roar of the world pigeons neck on the white roofs as i draw the curtains and look out over london rain-fresh in the morning light this is our element the bright reason on which we rely for the long-term solutions the orators yap and guns go off in a back street but the faith doesn ’ t die that in our time these things will amaze the literate children in their non-sectarian schools and the dark places be ablaze with love and poetry when the power of good prevails what middle-class shits we are to imagine for one second that our privileged ideals are divine wisdom and the dim forms that kneel at noon in the city not ourselves 2 i am going home by sea for the first time in years somebody thumbs a guitar on the dark deck while a gull dreams at the masthead the moon-splashed waves exult at dawn the ship trembles turns in a wide arc to back shuddering up the grey lough past lightship and buoy slipway and dry dock where a naked bulb burns and i step ashore in a fine rain to a city so changed by five years of war i scarcely recognize the places i grew up in the faces that try to explain but the hills are still the same grey-blue above belfast perhaps if i ’ d stayed behind and lived it bomb by bomb i might have grown up at last and learnt what is meant by home
let them not forget us the weak souls among the asphodels —seferis mythistorema for j. g. farrell even now there are places where a thought might grow — peruvian mines worked out and abandoned to a slow clock of condensation an echo trapped for ever and a flutter of wildflowers in the lift-shaft indian compounds where the wind dances and a door bangs with diminished confidence lime crevices behind rippling rain barrels dog corners for bone burials and in a disused shed in co. wexford deep in the grounds of a burnt-out hotel among the bathtubs and the washbasins a thousand mushrooms crowd to a keyhole this is the one star in their firmament or frames a star within a star what should they do there but desire so many days beyond the rhododendrons with the world waltzing in its bowl of cloud they have learnt patience and silence listening to the rooks querulous in the high wood they have been waiting for us in a foetor of vegetable sweat since civil war days since the gravel-crunching interminable departure of the expropriated mycologist he never came back and light since then is a keyhole rusting gently after rain spiders have spun flies dusted to mildew and once a day perhaps they have heard something — a trickle of masonry a shout from the blue or a lorry changing gear at the end of the lane there have been deaths the pale flesh flaking into the earth that nourished it and nightmares born of these and the grim dominion of stale air and rank moisture those nearest the door grow strong — ‘ elbow room elbow room ’ the rest dim in a twilight of crumbling utensils and broken pitchers groaning for their deliverance have been so long expectant that there is left only the posture a half century without visitors in the dark — poor preparation for the cracking lock and creak of hinges magi moonmen powdery prisoners of the old regime web-throated stalked like triffids racked by drought and insomnia only the ghost of a scream at the flash-bulb firing-squad we wake them with shows there is life yet in their feverish forms grown beyond nature now soft food for worms they lift frail heads in gravity and good faith they are begging us you see in their wordless way to do something to speak on their behalf or at least not to close the door again lost people of treblinka and pompeii ‘ save us save us ’ they seem to say ‘ let the god not abandon us who have come so far in darkness and in pain we too had our lives to live you with your light meter and relaxed itinerary let not our naive labours have been in vain ’
surely you paused at this roadside oasis in your nomadic youth and saw the mound of never-used cement the curious faces the soft-drink ads and the uneven ground rainbowed with oily puddles where a snail had scrawled its slimy phosphorescent trail like a frontier store-front in an old western it might have nothing behind it but thin air building materials fruit boxes scrap iron dust-laden shrubs and coils of rusty wire a cabbage-white fluttering in the sodden silence of an untended kitchen garden — nirvana but the cracked panes reveal a dark interior echoing with the cries of children here in this quiet corner of co. cork a family ate slept and watched the rain dance clean and cobalt the exhausted grit so that the mind shrank from the glare of it where did they go south boston cricklewood somebody somewhere thinks of this as home remembering the old pumps where they stood antique now squirting juice into a cream lagonda or a dung-caked tractor while a cloud swam on a cloud-reflecting tile surely a whitewashed sun-trap at the back gave way to hens wild thyme and the first few shadowy yards of an overgrown cart track tyres in the branches such as noah knew — beyond a swoop of mountain where you heard disconsolate in the haze a single blackbird left to itself the functional will cast a death-bed glow of picturesque abandon the intact antiquities of the recent past dropped from the retail catalogues return to the materials that gave rise to them and shine with a late sacramental gleam a god who spent the night here once rewarded natural courtesy with eternal life — changing to petrol pumps that they be spared for ever there an old man and his wife the virgin who escaped his dark design sanctions the townland from her prickly shrine we might be anywhere but are in one place only one of the milestones of earth-residence unique in each particular the thinly peopled hinterland serenely tense — not in the hope of a resplendent future but with a sure sense of its intrinsic nature

oh to be in england now that april 's there and whoever wakes in england sees some morning unaware that the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf while the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough in england—now and after april when may follows and the whitethroat builds and all the swallows hark where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge leans to the field and scatters on the clover blossoms and dewdrops—at the bent spray 's edge— that 's the wise thrush he sings each song twice over lest you should think he never could recapture the first fine careless rapture and though the fields look rough with hoary dew all will be gay when noontide wakes anew the buttercups the little children 's dower —far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower

aristotle was a little man with eyes like a lizard and he found a streak down the midst of things a smooth place for his feet much more important than the carved handles on the coffins of the great he said you should put your hand out at the time and place of need strength matters little he said nor even speed his pupil a king 's son died at an early age that aristotle spoke of him it is impossible to find—the youth was notorious a conqueror a kid with a gang but even this aristotle did n't ever say around the farthest forest and along all the bed of the sea aristotle studied immediate local ways many of which were wrong so he studied poetry there in pity and fear he found man many thinkers today who stand low and grin have little use for anger or power its palace or its prison— but quite a bit for that little man with eyes like a lizard
the unicorn is an easy prey its horn in the maiden ’ s lap is an obvious twist a tamed figure—like the hawk that once roamed free but sits now fat and hooded squawking on the hunter ’ s wrist it ’ s easy to catch what no longer captures the mind long since woven in a faded tapestry on a crumbling wall made by the women who wore keys at their waists and in their sleep came hot dreams of wounded knights left bleeding in their care who would wake the next morning groaning from the leftover lance in the groin look up into the round blond face beaming down at them thinking `` mine '' and say `` angel '' such beasts are easy to catch their dreams betray them but the hard prey is the one that won ’ t come bidden by these signs you will know it when you lift your lure out of the water the long plastic line will be missing its end the lure and the hook will be gone and the line will swing free in the air so light it will be without bait or its cunning sharp curl of silver or when you pull your net from the stream it will be eaten as if by acid its fine mesh sodden shreds or when you go at dawn to check your traps their great metal jaws will be wrenched open the teeth blunt with rust as if they had lain for years in the rain or when the thunderstorm suddenly breaks in the summer next morning the computer ’ s memory will be blank look then for the blank card the sprung trap the net ’ s dissolve the unburdened line that swings free in the air there by day go empty-handed to the hunt and come home the same way in the dark

to prepare the body aim for the translucent perfection you find in the sliced shavings of a pickled turnip in order for this to happen you must avoid the sun protect the face under a paper parasol until it is bruised white like the skin of lilies use white soap from a blue porcelain dish for this restrict yourself eat the whites of things tender bamboo shoots the veins of the young iris the clouded eye of a fish then wrap the body as if it were a perfumed gift in pieces of silk held together with invisible threads like a kite weighing no more than a handful of crushed chrysanthemums light enough to float in the wind you want the effect of koi moving through water when the light leaves the room twist lilacs into the lacquered hair piled high like a complicated shrine there should be tiny bells inserted somewhere in the web of hair to imitate crickets singing in a hidden grove reveal the nape of the neck your beauty spot hold the arrangement if your spine slacks and you feel faint remember the hand-picked flower set in the front alcove which just this morning you so skillfully wired into place how poised it is petal and leaf curving like a fan the stem snipped and wedged into the metal base— to appear like a spontaneous accident

wisdom and spirit of the universe thou soul that art the eternity of thought and giv'st to forms and images a breath and everlasting motion not in vain by day or star-light thus from my first dawn of childhood didst thou intertwine for me the passions that build up our human soul not with the mean and vulgar works of man but with high objects with enduring things with life and nature purifying thus the elements of feeling and of thought and sanctifying by such discipline both pain and fear —until we recognise a grandeur in the beatings of the heart nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me with stinted kindness in november days when vapours rolling down the valleys made a lonely scene more lonesome among woods at noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights when by the margin of the trembling lake beneath the gloomy hills homeward i went in solitude such intercourse was mine mine was it in the fields both day and night and by the waters all the summer long and in the frosty season when the sun was set and visible for many a mile the cottage-windows through the twilight blazed i heeded not the summons happy time it was indeed for all of us for me it was a time of rapture clear and loud the village-clock tolled six—i wheeled about proud and exulting like an untired horse that cares not for his home.—all shod with steel we hissed along the polished ice in games confederate imitative of the chase and woodland pleasures —the resounding horn the pack loud-chiming and the hunted hare so through the darkness and the cold we flew and not a voice was idle with the din smitten the precipices rang aloud the leafless trees and every icy crag tinkled like iron while far-distant hills into the tumult sent an alien sound of melancholy not unnoticed while the stars eastward were sparkling clear and in the west the orange sky of evening died away not seldom from the uproar i retired into a silent bay or sportively glanced sideway leaving the tumultuous throng to cut across the reflex of a star image that flying still before me gleamed upon the glassy plain and oftentimes when we had given our bodies to the wind and all the shadowy banks on either side came sweeping through the darkness spinning still the rapid line of motion then at once have i reclining back upon my heels stopped short yet still the solitary cliffs wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled with visible motion her diurnal round behind me did they stretch in solemn train feebler and feebler and i stood and watched till all was tranquil as a summer sea

in party outfits two by two or one by one i was expected to go along as well they step up the steep gangplank hands on metal railing the river youthful also in midnight blue with sunset-tinted wavelets lets them borrow its broad back for an evening ’ s unhurried round trip which won ’ t interrupt old river habits for long not the chop and churn of big propellers as the rocking stern heaves off and wheels fanwise into the current nor a short blast from the stack not the up-tempo drumbeat of the black-tie combo nor an answering fusillade of popped corks not geysers of laughter pitched flagpole high among flailing limbs out on the polished floor nor the mixed babble of sideline comment over bubbling glasses can shake that seamless imperturbability when the springy net of sparkles has shrunk and faded out of sight the last rough throb been coaxed from the tenor sax ’ s frog-in-the-throat the final needling tremolo of the clarinet been wrapped up in distance suddenly it is strange to be here in lilac afterglow with trout-leap and mayfly strange too how our part of the river continues to trundle along its tonnages of water and motion the unused ticket spins to the ground as much as any person not two people can i miss the jaunt for just this one hour of dusk then a veiled echo my name called as i turn to answer eyes adjusting to where we are at the pivot of night the cusp of light light enough to feel our way back to the grove of alders along the curving path beside the river light enough to recognize my life when i see it going in its direction more or less at the same pace
when john henry was a little tiny baby sitting on his mama 's knee he picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel saying `` hammer 's going to be the death of me lord lord hammer 's going to be the death of me '' john henry was a man just six feet high nearly two feet and a half across his breast he 'd hammer with a nine-pound hammer all day and never get tired and want to rest lord lord and never get tired and want to rest john henry went up on the mountain and he looked one eye straight up its side the mountain was so tall and john henry was so small he laid down his hammer and he cried `` lord lord '' he laid down his hammer and he cried john henry said to his captain '' captain you go to town bring me back a twelve-pound hammer please and i 'll beat that steam drill down lord lord i 'll beat that steam drill down '' the captain said to john henry '' i believe this mountain 's sinking in '' but john henry said `` captain just you stand aside -- it 's nothing but my hammer catching wind lord lord it 's nothing but my hammer catching wind '' john henry said to his shaker '' shaker boy you better start to pray 'cause if my twelve-pound hammer miss that little piece of steel tomorrow 'll be your burying day lord lord tomorrow 'll be your burying day '' john henry said to his captain '' a man is nothing but a man but before i let your steam drill beat me down i 'd die with a hammer in my hand lord lord i 'd die with a hammer in my hand '' the man that invented the steam drill he figured he was mighty high and fine but john henry sunk the steel down fourteen feet while the steam drill only made nine lord lord the steam drill only made nine john henry hammered on the right-hand side steam drill kept driving on the left john henry beat that steam drill down but he hammered his poor heart to death lord lord he hammered his poor heart to death well they carried john henry down the tunnel and they laid his body in the sand now every woman riding on a c and o train says `` there lies my steel-driving man lord lord there lies my steel-driving man ''
snake river country i now remembered slowly how i came i sometime living sometime with a name creeping by iron ways across the bare wastes of wyoming turning in despair changing and turning till the fall of night then throbbing motionless with iron might four days and nights small stations by the way sunk far past midnight nothing one can say names the compassion they stir in the heart obscure men shift and cry and we depart and i remembered with the early sun that foul-mouthed barber back in pendleton the sprawling streets the icy station bench the round-up pennants the latrinal stench these towns are cold by day the flesh of vice raw and decisive and the will precise at night the turbulence of drink and mud blue glare of gas the dances dripping blood fists thudding murder in the shadowy air exhausted whores sunk to a changeless stare alive in empty fact alone extreme they make each fact a mortuary dream once when the train paused in an empty place i met the unmoved landscape face to face smoothing abysses that no stream could slake deep in its black gulch crept the heavy snake the sound diffused and so intently firm it seemed the silence having change nor term beyond the river gray volcanic stone in rolling hills the river moved alone and when we started charged with mass and slow we hung against it in an awful flow thus i proceeded until early night and when i read the station ’ s name aright descended—at the bidding of a word i slept the night out where the thought occurred then rose to view the dwelling where i lay outside the bare land stretching far away the frame house new fortuitous and bright pointing the presence of the morning light a train ’ s far screaming clean as shining steel planing the distance for the gliding heel through shrinking frost autumnal grass uncurled in naked sunlight on a naked world
wolbe dich welt wenn die totenmuschel heranschwimmt will es hier läuten vault over world when the seashell of death washes up there will be a knelling —paul celan stimmen voices death knocks all night at my door the soul answers and runs from the water in my throat water will sustain me when i climb the steep hill that leads to a now familiar place i began even as a child to learn water 's order and as i grew intact the feel of its warmth in a new sponge of its weight in a virgin towel i have earned my wine in another 's misery when rum bathed a sealed throat and cast its seal on the ground i will be bound to the one who leads me away by the ornaments on my wrists the gold dust in my ears below my eye and tied to my loincloth in a leather pouch they dress me now in my best cloth and fold my hands adorned with silk against my left cheek gold lies with me on my left side gold has become the color of distance and of your sorrow sorrow lies red clay on my brow red pepper caresses my temples i am adorned in the russet-brown message the soul brings from its coming-to-be there is a silken despair in my body that grief shakes from it a cat 's voice controlled by palm wine and a widow 's passion it is time to feed the soul —a hen eggs mashed yams— and encourage the thirst resting near the right hand i see before me always i think of death i can not eat i walk in sadness and i die yet life is the invocation sealed in the coffin and will walk through our wall passing and passing and passing until it is set down to be lifted from this body 's habitation i now assume the widow 's pot the lamp that will lead me through solitude to the edge of my husband 's journey i hold three stones upon my head darkness i will release when i run from the dead with my eyes turned away toward another light this is the day of rising a hut sits in the bush sheltered by summe standing on four forked ends we have prepared for the soul 's feast with pestle mortar a strainer three hearthstones a new pot and new spoon someone has stripped the hut 's body and dressed it with the edowa now when the wine speaks and the fire has lifted its voice the dead will be clothed in hair the signs of our grief sun closes down on an intensity of ghosts it is time to close the path it is time for the snail 's pace of coming again into life with the world swept clean the crying done and our ordinary garments decent in the dead one 's eyes

excerpt i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heap 'd from ever-shifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds such as from earth 's embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited sea-side which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes broken and unrepair 'd and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where 't was our wont to ride while day went down this ride was my delight i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remember 'd friend i love to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripp 'd to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth harmonizing with solitude and sent into our hearts aëreal merriment so as we rode we talk 'd and the swift thought winging itself with laughter linger 'd not but flew from brain to brain—such glee was ours charg 'd with light memories of remember 'd hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it can not scorn the thoughts it would extinguish 't was forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argu 'd against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side the sense that he was greater than his kind had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light meanwhile the sun paus 'd ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains—oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then just where we had dismounted the count 's men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood which lay between the city and the shore pav 'd with the image of the sky ... the hoar and aëry alps towards the north appear'd through mist an heaven-sustaining bulwark rear'd between the east and west and half the sky was roof 'd with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paus 'd in his descent among the many-folded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peakèd isles— and then—as if the earth and sea had been dissolv 'd into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent `` ere it fade '' said my companion `` i will show you soon a better station '' —so o'er the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i lean 'd and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evening 's gleam its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment pil 'd to heaven i was about to speak when— '' we are even now at the point i meant '' said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row `` look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell '' i look 'd and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile a windowless deform 'd and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance sway 'd and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it toll'd in strong and black relief `` what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower '' said maddalo `` and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell to vespers '' `` as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker '' i replied `` o ho you talk as in years past '' said maddalo. '' 't is strange men change not you were ever still among christ 's flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambs—if you ca n't swim beware of providence '' i look 'd on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye `` and such '' he cried `` is our mortality and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heaven-illumin 'd tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below round the rent heart and pray—as madmen do for what they know not—till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled '' i recall the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower look 'd gray and all between the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloom —into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently we hardly spoke and soon the gondola convey 'd me to my lodgings by the way the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i call 'd on him and whilst i waited with his child i play 'd a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes—oh speak not of her eyes —which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me she was a special favourite i had nurs'd her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seem 'd to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less chang 'd than she was by six months or so for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count enter 'd salutations past— '' the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit—if man be the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws though i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith '' —thus much i spoke and noting he replied not added `` see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night it is our will that thus enchains us to permitted ill. we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind and if we were not weak should we be less in deed than in desire '' `` ay if we were not weak—and we aspire how vainly to be strong '' said maddalo '' you talk utopia '' `` it remains to know '' i then rejoin 'd `` and those who try may find how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw ... we are assur'd much may be conquer 'd much may be endur 'd of what degrades and crushes us we know that we have power over ourselves to do and suffer—what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reign 'd before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind yet feel their faith religion '' `` my dear friend '' said maddalo `` my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutation-tight as far as words go i knew one like you who to this city came some months ago with whom i argu 'd in this sort and he is now gone mad—and so he answer 'd me— poor fellow but if you would like to go we 'll visit him and his wild talk will show how vain are such aspiring theories '' `` i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a 'soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bow'd his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this— to love and be belov 'd with gentleness and being scorn 'd what wonder if they die some living death this is not destiny but man 's own wilful ill. '' as thus i spoke servants announc 'd the gondola and we through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea sail 'd to the island where the madhouse stands
the kindness of others is all they ever wanted the laughter of neighbors prospering in the blue light of summer those of the small sputtering flame and the sudden white sprung hair who feed off envy and grow old quickly desire largesse the role of poor relation evokes a lack they are not apt to admit or unbearable pity they prefer to penetrate the giver ’ s effortless knack of giving they perceive as vitality a pulsating entity that rewards the kindness of others tenfold this they have witnessed this they have tabulated relentlessly the generosity of others whose spirits like their long-legged children blossoming into a progeny of orchards and fields flourish those who have never known kindness drag into the privacy of their smallness the baskets of fruit appearing year after year on their porches to be picked apart in the hushed posture of thieves they peel skin probe flesh the color of honey as if the seeds will yield something other than a glimmer of sweet air rising from the roots of trees and licorice-laced half-opened leaves those of the small flame who feed off envy and grow old quickly live out their lives hungry glaring at themselves across the table wife of the cruel mouth husband of the thin broth trickling like spittle
it is said that playing cards were invented in 1392 to cure the french king charles vi of madness the suits in some of the first card packs consisted of doves peacocks ravens and owls they say i am excitable how could i not scream the swiss monk ’ s tonsure spun till it blurred yet his eyes were still i snapped my gaiter hard to stuff back my mirth lords he then began to speak indus catarum he said presenting the game of cards in which the state of the world is excellent described and figured he decked his mouth as they do a solemn stitch and left cards in my hands i cast them down what need have i for amusement my brain ’ s a park yet your company plucked them from the ground and began to play lords i wither the monk spoke right the mealy wretch the sorry patterns show the deceiving constructions of your minds i have made the deuce of ravens my sword falling through your pillows and rising the wing blades still running with the jugular blood your bodies lurch through the steps of an unpleasant dance no lutes play i have silenced the lutes i keep watch in the clipped convulsed garden i must have silence to hear the messenger ’ s footfall in my brain for i am the king of owls where i float no shadow falls i have hungers such terrible hungers you can not know lords i sharpen my talons on your bones

before you can learn the trees you have to learn the language of the trees that ’ s done indoors out of a book which now you think of it is one of the transformations of a tree the words themselves are a delight to learn you might be in a foreign land of terms like samara capsule drupe legume and pome where bark is papery plated warty or smooth but best of all are the words that shape the leaves— orbicular cordate cleft and reniform— and their venation—palmate and parallel— and tips—acute truncate auriculate sufficiently provided you may now go forth to the forests and the shady streets to see how the chaos of experience answers to catalogue and category confusedly the leaves of a single tree may differ among themselves more than they do from other species so you have to find all blandly says the book “ an average leaf. ” example the catalpa in the book sprays out its leaves in whorls of three around the stem the one in front of you but rarely does or somewhat or almost maybe it ’ s not catalpa dreadful doubt it may be weeks before you see an elm fanlike in form a spruce that pyramids a sweetgum spiring up in steeple shape still pedetemtim as lucretius says little by little you do start to learn and learn as well maybe what language does and how it does it cutting across the world not always at the joints competing with experience while cooperating with experience and keeping an obstinate intransigence uncanny of its own think finally about the secret will pretending obedience to nature but invidiously distinguishing everywhere dividing up the world to conquer it and think also how funny knowledge is you may succeed in learning many trees and calling off their names as you go by but their comprehensive silence stays the same
let us go hence my songs she will not hear let us go hence together without fear keep silence now for singing-time is over and over all old things and all things dear she loves not you nor me as all we love her yea though we sang as angels in her ear she would not hear let us rise up and part she will not know let us go seaward as the great winds go full of blown sand and foam what help is here there is no help for all these things are so and all the world is bitter as a tear and how these things are though ye strove to show she would not know let us go home and hence she will not weep we gave love many dreams and days to keep flowers without scent and fruits that would not grow saying 'if thou wilt thrust in thy sickle and reap all is reaped now no grass is left to mow and we that sowed though all we fell on sleep she would not weep let us go hence and rest she will not love she shall not hear us if we sing hereof nor see love 's ways how sore they are and steep come hence let be lie still it is enough love is a barren sea bitter and deep and though she saw all heaven in flower above she would not love let us give up go down she will not care though all the stars made gold of all the air and the sea moving saw before it move one moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair though all those waves went over us and drove deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair she would not care let us go hence go hence she will not see sing all once more together surely she she too remembering days and words that were will turn a little toward us sighing but we we are hence we are gone as though we had not been there nay and though all men seeing had pity on me she would not see
wahiawa is still a red dirt town where the sticky smell of pineapples being lopped off in the low-lying fields rises to mix with the minty leaves of eucalyptus in the bordering gulch we lived there near the edge where the orchids grew huge as lanterns overnight and the passion fruits rotted on the vines before they could be picked we grew there in the steady rain that fell like a gray curtain through which my mother peered patches of depression she kept the children under cover we built houses within houses stripping our parents ’ bed of pillows and sheets erecting walls out of the national geographic which my father had subscribed to for years we feasted on those pictures of the world while the mud oozed past the windows knocking over the drab green leaves of palm fronds as we ate our spinach the mildew grew in rings around the sink where centipedes came swimming up the pipes on multiple feet and the mold grew around our small fingers making everything slippery to touch we were squeamish and pale i remember one night my sister screamed all the lights blinked on in the house in the sudden brightness we rushed to her room and found her crumpled in the far corner of the bed her nightgown twisted in a strange shape her eyes were as huge as mine staring into the eyes of the bat that clung to the screen its rodent fingers finally letting go as my father jabbed its furry body with the end of a broom
ugliest little boy that everyone ever saw that is what everyone said even to his mother it was apparent— when the blue-aproned nurse came into the northeast end of the maternity ward bearing his squeals and plump bottom looped up in a scant receiving blanket bending to pass the bundle carefully into the waiting mother-hands—that this was no cute little ugliness no sly baby waywardness that was going to inch away as would baby fat baby curl and baby spot-rash the pendulous lip the branching ears the eyes so wide and wild the vague unvibrant brown of the skin and most disturbing the great head these components of that look bespoke the sure fibre the deep grain his father could not bear the sight of him his mother high-piled her pretty dyed hair and put him among her hairpins and sweethearts dance slippers torn paper roses he was not less than these he was not more as the little lincoln grew uglily upward and out he began to understand that something was wrong his little ways of trying to please his father the bringing of matches the jumping aside at warning sound of oh-so-large and rushing stride the smile that gave and gave and gave—unsuccessful even christmases and easters were spoiled he would be sitting at the family feasting table really delighting in the displays of mashed potatoes and the rich golden fat-crust of the ham or the festive fowl when he would look up and find somebody feeling indignant about him what a pity what a pity no love for one so loving the little lincoln loved everybody ants the changing caterpillar his much-missing mother his kindergarten teacher his kindergarten teacher—whose concern for him was composed of one part sympathy and two parts repulsion the others ran up with their little drawings he ran up with his she tried to be as pleasant with him as with others but it was difficult for she was all pretty all daintiness all tiny vanilla with blue eyes and fluffy sun-hair one afternoon she saw him in the hall looking bleak against the wall it was strange because the bell had long since rung and no other child was in sight pity flooded her she buttoned her gloves and suggested cheerfully that she walk him home she started out bravely holding him by the hand but she had not walked far before she regretted it the little monkey must everyone look and clutching her hand like that literally pinching it at seven the little lincoln loved the brother and sister who moved next door handsome well- dressed charitable often to him they enjoyed him because he was resourceful made up games told stories but when their more acceptable friends came they turned their handsome backs on him he hated himself for his feeling of well-being when with them despite— everything he spent much time looking at himself in mirrors what could be done but there was no shrinking his head there was no binding his ears “ don ’ t touch me ” cried the little fairy-like being in the playground her name was nerissa the many children were playing tag but when he caught her she recoiled jerked free and ran it was like all the rainbow that ever was going off forever all all the sparklings in the sunset west one day while he was yet seven a thing happened in the down-town movies with his mother a white man in the seat beside him whispered loudly to a companion and pointed at the little linc “ there that ’ s the kind i ’ ve been wanting to show you one of the best examples of the specie not like those diluted negroes you see so much of on the streets these days but the real thing black ugly and odd you can see the savagery the blunt blankness that is the real thing. ” his mother—her hair had never looked so red around the dark brown velvet of her face—jumped up shrieked “ go to— ” she did not finish she yanked to his feet the little lincoln who was sitting there staring in fascination at his assessor at the author of his new idea all the way home he was happy of course he had not liked the word “ ugly. ” but after all should he not be used to that by now what had struck him among words and meanings he could little understand was the phrase “ the real thing. ” he didn ’ t know quite why but he liked that he liked that very much when he was hurt too much stared at— too much left alone—he thought about that he told himself “ after all i ’ m the real thing. ” it comforted him
no sooner does the plane angle up than i cork off to dream a bomb blast a fireball roiling through the cabin in slo-mo seat blown loose from its bolts i hang weightless a nanosecond in blue space then jerk awake to ordered rows and there ’ s the silver liquor cart jangling its thousand bells the perfect doses of juniper gin and oak-flavored scotch held by a rose-nailed hand i don ’ t miss drinking don ’ t miss driving into shit with more molecular density than myself nor the mission impossible reruns i sat before nor the dead space inside only alcohol could fill and then not even but i miss the aftermath the pure simplicity mouth parched head hissing static how little i asked of myself then—to suck the next breath suffer the next heave live till cocktail hour when i could mix the next sickness i locked the bathroom door sat on the closed commode shirtless in filmy underpants telling myself that death could fit my grasp and be staved off while in the smeary shaving glass i practiced the stillness of a soul awaiting birth for the real that swarmed beyond the door i was pure scorn dead center of my stone and starless universe orbited by no one novitiate obliterate saint absence duchess of naught a stinging ether folded me in mist sometimes landing the head 's pressure ’ s enormous when my plane tilts down houses grow large streets lose their clear geometry the leafy earth soon fills my portal and in the gray graveyard of cars a stick figure becomes my son in royal blue cap flapping his arms as if to rise thank god for our place in this forest of forms for the gravitas that draws me back to him and for how lightly lightly i touch down

many a green isle needs must be in the deep wide sea of misery or the mariner worn and wan never thus could voyage on day and night and night and day drifting on his dreary way with the solid darkness black closing round his vessel 's track whilst above the sunless sky big with clouds hangs heavily and behind the tempest fleet hurries on with lightning feet riving sail and cord and plank till the ship has almost drank death from the o'er-brimming deep and sinks down down like that sleep when the dreamer seems to be weltering through eternity and the dim low line before of a dark and distant shore still recedes as ever still longing with divided will but no power to seek or shun he is ever drifted on o'er the unreposing wave to the haven of the grave what if there no friends will greet what if there no heart will meet his with love 's impatient beat wander wheresoe'er he may can he dream before that day to find refuge from distress in friendship 's smile in love 's caress then 'twill wreak him little woe whether such there be or no senseless is the breast and cold which relenting love would fold bloodless are the veins and chill which the pulse of pain did fill every little living nerve that from bitter words did swerve round the tortur 'd lips and brow are like sapless leaflets now frozen upon december 's bough on the beach of a northern sea which tempests shake eternally as once the wretch there lay to sleep lies a solitary heap one white skull and seven dry bones on the margin of the stones where a few gray rushes stand boundaries of the sea and land nor is heard one voice of wail but the sea-mews as they sail o'er the billows of the gale or the whirlwind up and down howling like a slaughter 'd town when a king in glory rides through the pomp of fratricides those unburied bones around there is many a mournful sound there is no lament for him like a sunless vapour dim who once cloth 'd with life and thought what now moves nor murmurs not ay many flowering islands lie in the waters of wide agony to such a one this morn was led my bark by soft winds piloted 'mid the mountains euganean i stood listening to the paean with which the legion 'd rooks did hail the sun 's uprise majestical gathering round with wings all hoar through the dewy mist they soar like gray shades till the eastern heaven bursts and then as clouds of even fleck 'd with fire and azure lie in the unfathomable sky so their plumes of purple grain starr 'd with drops of golden rain gleam above the sunlight woods as in silent multitudes on the morning 's fitful gale through the broken mist they sail and the vapours cloven and gleaming follow down the dark steep streaming till all is bright and clear and still round the solitary hill beneath is spread like a green sea the waveless plain of lombardy bounded by the vaporous air islanded by cities fair underneath day 's azure eyes ocean 's nursling venice lies a peopled labyrinth of walls amphitrite 's destin 'd halls which her hoary sire now paves with his blue and beaming waves lo the sun upsprings behind broad red radiant half-reclin'd on the level quivering line of the water crystalline and before that chasm of light as within a furnace bright column tower and dome and spire shine like obelisks of fire pointing with inconstant motion from the altar of dark ocean to the sapphire-tinted skies as the flames of sacrifice from the marble shrines did rise as to pierce the dome of gold where apollo spoke of old sun-girt city thou hast been ocean 's child and then his queen now is come a darker day and thou soon must be his prey if the power that rais 'd thee here hallow so thy watery bier a less drear ruin then than now with thy conquest-branded brow stooping to the slave of slaves from thy throne among the waves wilt thou be when the sea-mew flies as once before it flew o'er thine isles depopulate and all is in its ancient state save where many a palace gate with green sea-flowers overgrown like a rock of ocean 's own topples o'er the abandon 'd sea as the tides change sullenly the fisher on his watery way wandering at the close of day will spread his sail and seize his oar till he pass the gloomy shore lest thy dead should from their sleep bursting o'er the starlight deep lead a rapid masque of death o'er the waters of his path those who alone thy towers behold quivering through a e real gold as i now behold them here would imagine not they were sepulchres where human forms like pollution-nourish 'd worms to the corpse of greatness cling murder 'd and now mouldering but if freedom should awake in her omnipotence and shake from the celtic anarch 's hold all the keys of dungeons cold where a hundred cities lie chain 'd like thee ingloriously thou and all thy sister band might adorn this sunny land twining memories of old time with new virtues more sublime if not perish thou and they clouds which stain truth 's rising day by her sun consum 'd away— earth can spare ye while like flowers in the waste of years and hours from your dust new nations spring with more kindly blossoming perish—let there only be floating o'er thy hearthless sea as the garment of thy sky clothes the world immortally one remembrance more sublime than the tatter 'd pall of time which scarce hides thy visage wan that a tempest-cleaving swan of the sons of albion driven from his ancestral streams by the might of evil dreams found a nest in thee and ocean welcom 'd him with such emotion that its joy grew his and sprung from his lips like music flung o'er a mighty thunder-fit chastening terror what though yet poesy 's unfailing river which through albion winds forever lashing with melodious wave many a sacred poet 's grave mourn its latest nursling fled what though thou with all thy dead scarce can for this fame repay aught thine own oh rather say though thy sins and slaveries foul overcloud a sunlike soul as the ghost of homer clings round scamander 's wasting springs as divinest shakespeare 's might fills avon and the world with light like omniscient power which he imag 'd 'mid mortality as the love from petrarch 's urn yet amid yon hills doth burn a quenchless lamp by which the heart sees things unearthly so thou art mighty spirit so shall be the city that did refuge thee lo the sun floats up the sky like thought-winged liberty till the universal light seems to level plain and height from the sea a mist has spread and the beams of morn lie dead on the towers of venice now like its glory long ago by the skirts of that gray cloud many-domed padua proud stands a peopled solitude 'mid the harvest-shining plain where the peasant heaps his grain in the garner of his foe and the milk-white oxen slow with the purple vintage strain heap 'd upon the creaking wain that the brutal celt may swill drunken sleep with savage will and the sickle to the sword lies unchang 'd though many a lord like a weed whose shade is poison overgrows this region 's foison sheaves of whom are ripe to come to destruction 's harvest-home men must reap the things they sow force from force must ever flow or worse but 't is a bitter woe that love or reason can not change the despot 's rage the slave 's revenge padua thou within whose walls those mute guests at festivals son and mother death and sin play 'd at dice for ezzelin till death cried 'i win i win and sin curs 'd to lose the wager but death promis 'd to assuage her that he would petition for her to be made vice-emperor when the destin 'd years were o'er over all between the po and the eastern alpine snow under the mighty austrian sin smil 'd so as sin only can and since that time ay long before both have rul 'd from shore to shore that incestuous pair who follow tyrants as the sun the swallow as repentance follows crime and as changes follow time in thine halls the lamp of learning padua now no more is burning like a meteor whose wild way is lost over the grave of day it gleams betray 'd and to betray once remotest nations came to adore that sacred flame when it lit not many a hearth on this cold and gloomy earth now new fires from antique light spring beneath the wide world 's might but their spark lies dead in thee trampled out by tyranny as the norway woodman quells in the depth of piny dells one light flame among the brakes while the boundless forest shakes and its mighty trunks are torn by the fire thus lowly born the spark beneath his feet is dead he starts to see the flames it fed howling through the darken 'd sky with myriad tongues victoriously and sinks down in fear so thou o tyranny beholdest now light around thee and thou hearest the loud flames ascend and fearest grovel on the earth ay hide in the dust thy purple pride noon descends around me now 'tis the noon of autumn 's glow when a soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst or an air-dissolved star mingling light and fragrance far from the curv 'd horizon 's bound to the point of heaven 's profound fills the overflowing sky and the plains that silent lie underneath the leaves unsodden where the infant frost has trodden with his morning-winged feet whose bright print is gleaming yet and the red and golden vines piercing with their trellis 'd lines the rough dark-skirted wilderness the dun and bladed grass no less pointing from his hoary tower in the windless air the flower glimmering at my feet the line of the olive-sandall 'd apennine in the south dimly islanded and the alps whose snows are spread high between the clouds and sun and of living things each one and my spirit which so long darken 'd this swift stream of song interpenetrated lie by the glory of the sky be it love light harmony odour or the soul of all which from heaven like dew doth fall or the mind which feeds this verse peopling the lone universe noon descends and after noon autumn 's evening meets me soon leading the infantine moon and that one star which to her almost seems to minister half the crimson light she brings from the sunset 's radiant springs and the soft dreams of the morn which like winged winds had borne to that silent isle which lies mid remember 'd agonies the frail bark of this lone being pass to other sufferers fleeing and its ancient pilot pain sits beside the helm again other flowering isles must be in the sea of life and agony other spirits float and flee o'er that gulf even now perhaps on some rock the wild wave wraps with folded wings they waiting sit for my bark to pilot it to some calm and blooming cove where for me and those i love may a windless bower be built far from passion pain and guilt in a dell mid lawny hills which the wild sea-murmur fills and soft sunshine and the sound of old forests echoing round and the light and smell divine of all flowers that breathe and shine we may live so happy there that the spirits of the air envying us may even entice to our healing paradise the polluting multitude but their rage would be subdu'd by that clime divine and calm and the winds whose wings rain balm on the uplifted soul and leaves under which the bright sea heaves while each breathless interval in their whisperings musical the inspired soul supplies with its own deep melodies and the love which heals all strife circling like the breath of life all things in that sweet abode with its own mild brotherhood they not it would change and soon every sprite beneath the moon would repent its envy vain and the earth grow young again

dear mother dear mother the church is cold but the ale-house is healthy pleasant warm besides i can tell where i am use 'd well such usage in heaven will never do well but if at the church they would give us some ale and a pleasant fire our souls to regale we 'd sing and we 'd pray all the live-long day nor ever once wish from the church to stray then the parson might preach drink sing and we 'd be as happy as birds in the spring and modest dame lurch who is always at church would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch and god like a father rejoicing to see his children as pleasant and happy as he would have no more quarrel with the devil or the barrel but kiss him give him both drink and apparel

i open the box of my favorite postcards and turn them over looking for de chirico because i remember seeing you standing facing a wall no wider than a column where to your left was a hall going straight back into darkness the floor a ramp sloping down to where you stood alone and where the room opened out on your right to an auditorium full of people who had just heard you read and were now listening to the other poet i was looking for the de chirico because of the places the empty places the word “ boulevard ” came to mind standing on the side of the fountains in paris where the water blew onto me when i was fifteen it was night it was dark then too and i was alone why didn ’ t you find me why didn ’ t somebody find me all those years the form of love was purity an art an architecture maybe a train maybe the shadow of a statue and the statue with its front turned away from me maybe one young girl playing alone hearing even small sounds ring off cobblestones and the stone walls i turn the cards looking for the one and come to giacometti ’ s eyes full of caring and something remote his eyes are loving and empty but not with nothingness not for the usual reasons but because he is working the rothko chapel empty a cheap statue of sappho in the modern city of mytilene and ancient sunlight david park ’ s four men with smudges for mouths backed by water each held still by the impossibility of what art can accomplish a broken river god only the body a girl playing with her rabbit in bed the postcard of a summer lightning storm over iowa

a little loam and topsoil is a lot —heather mchugh a vacant lot maybe but even such lit vacancy as interstate motels announce can look well pretty damned inviting after a long day ’ s drive especially if the day has been oppressed by manic truckers detours endless road construction and this poorly measured semi- rectangle projected and plotted with the familiar little flags upon a spread of neglected terra firma also offers brief apprehension which—let ’ s face it whether pleasing or encumbered by anxiety—dwells luxuriously in potential me well i like a little space between shopping malls and while this one may never come to be much of a garden once we rip the old tires from the brambles and bag the trash we might just glimpse the lot we meant the lot we hoped to find
under yonder beech-tree single on the green-sward couched with her arms behind her golden head knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly lies my young love sleeping in the shade had i the heart to slide an arm beneath her press her parting lips as her waist i gather slow waking in amazement she could not but embrace me then would she hold me and never let me go shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow swift as the swallow along the river 's light circleting the surface to meet his mirrored winglets fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine-tops wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun she whom i love is hard to catch and conquer hard but o the glory of the winning were she won when her mother tends her before the laughing mirror tying up her laces looping up her hair often she thinks were this wild thing wedded more love should i have and much less care when her mother tends her before the lighted mirror loosening her laces combing down her curls often she thinks were this wild thing wedded i should miss but one for many boys and girls heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon no she is athirst and drinking up her wonder earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon deals she an unkindness 't is but her rapid measure even as in a dance and her smile can heal no less like the swinging may-cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones off a sunny border she was made to bruise and bless lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping wavy in the dusk lit by one large star lone on the fir-branch his rattle-note unvaried brooding o'er the gloom spins the brown eve-jar darker grows the valley more and more forgetting so were it with me if forgetting could be willed tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well-spring tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled stepping down the hill with her fair companions arm in arm all against the raying west boldly she sings to the merry tune she marches brave in her shape and sweeter unpossessed sweeter for she is what my heart first awaking whispered the world was morning light is she love that so desires would fain keep her changeless fain would fling the net and fain have her free happy happy time when the white star hovers low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew near the face of dawn that draws athwart the darkness threading it with colour as yewberries the yew thicker crowd the shades while the grave east deepens glowing and with crimson a long cloud swells maiden still the morn is and strange she is and secret strange her eyes her cheeks are cold as cold sea-shells sunrays leaning on our southern hills and lighting wild cloud-mountains that drag the hills along oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter chill as a dull face frowning on a song ay but shows the south-west a ripple-feathered bosom blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend scaling the mid-heavens as they stream there comes a sunset rich deep like love in beauty without end when at dawn she sighs and like an infant to the window turns grave eyes craving light released from dreams beautiful she looks like a white water-lily bursting out of bud in havens of the streams when from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle in her long nightgown sweet as boughs of may beautiful she looks like a tall garden lily pure from the night and splendid for the day mother of the dews dark eye-lashed twilight low-lidded twilight o'er the valley 's brim rounding on thy breast sings the dew-delighted skylark clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers let me hear her laughter i would have her ever cool as dew in twilight the lark above the flowers all the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose up lanes woods through they troop in joyful bands my sweet leads she knows not why but now she totters eyes the bent anemones and hangs her hands such a look will tell that the violets are peeping coming the rose and unaware a cry springs in her bosom for odours and for colour covert and the nightingale she knows not why kerchiefed head and chin she darts between her tulips streaming like a willow grey in arrowy rain some bend beaten cheek to gravel and their angel she will be she lifts them and on she speeds again black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway she is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth so when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder saw i once a white dove sole light of earth prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden trained to stand in rows and asking if they please i might love them well but for loving more the wild ones o my wild ones they tell me more than these you my wild one you tell of honied field-rose violet blushing eglantine in life and even as they they by the wayside are earnest of your goodness you are of life 's on the banks that line the way peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three parted is the window she sleeps the starry jasmine breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me sweeter unpossessed have i said of her my sweetest not while she sleeps while she sleeps the jasmine breathes luring her to love she sleeps the starry jasmine bears me to her pillow under white rose-wreaths yellow with birdfoot-trefoil are the grass-glades yellow with cinquefoil of the dew-grey leaf yellow with stonecrop the moss-mounds are yellow blue-necked the wheat sways yellowing to the sheaf green-yellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens thinking of the harvest i look and think of mine this i may know her dressing and undressing such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport shift from cloud to moonlight or edging over thunder slips a ray of sun or sweeping into port white sails furl or on the ocean borders white sails lean along the waves leaping green visions of her shower before me but from eyesight guarded she would be like the sun were she seen front door and back of the mossed old farmhouse open with the morn and in a breezy link freshly sparkles garden to stripe-shadowed orchard green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink busy in the grass the early sun of summer swarms and the blackbird 's mellow fluting notes call my darling up with round and roguish challenge quaintest richest carol of all the singing throats cool was the woodside cool as her white dairy keeping sweet the cream-pan and there the boys from school cricketing below rushed brown and red with sunshine o the dark translucence of the deep-eyed cool spying from the farm herself she fetched a pitcher full of milk and tilted for each in turn the beak then a little fellow mouth up and on tiptoe said `` i will kiss you '' she laughed and leaned her cheek doves of the fir-wood walling high our red roof through the long noon coo crooning through the coo loose droop the leaves and down the sleepy roadway sometimes pipes a chaffinch loose droops the blue cows flap a slow tail knee-deep in the river breathless given up to sun and gnat and fly nowhere is she seen and if i see her nowhere lightning may come straight rains and tiger sky o the golden sheaf the rustling treasure-armful o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced o the treasure-tresses one another over nodding o the girdle slack about the waist slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet quick amid the wheatears wound about the waist gathered see these brides of earth one blush of ripeness o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced large and smoky red the sun 's cold disk drops clipped by naked hills on violet shaded snow eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow nightlong on black print-branches our beech-tree gazes in this whiteness nightlong could i. here may life on death or death on life be painted let me clasp her soul to know she can not die gossips count her faults they scour a narrow chamber where there is no window read not heaven or her `` when she was a tiny '' one aged woman quavers plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear faults she had once as she learnt to run and tumbled faults of feature some see beauty not complete yet good gossips beauty that makes holy earth and air may have faults from head to feet hither she comes she comes to me she lingers deepens her brown eyebrows while in new surprise high rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger yet am i the light and living of her eyes something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming nets her in her blushes and wounds her and tames.— sure of her haven o like a dove alighting arms up she dropped our souls were in our names soon will she lie like a white-frost sunrise yellow oats and brown wheat barley pale as rye long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher felt the girdle loosened seen the tresses fly soon will she lie like a blood-red sunset swift with the to-morrow green-winged spring sing from the south-west bring her back the truants nightingale and swallow song and dipping wing soft new beech-leaves up to beamy april spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain you lucid in the moon raise lilies to the skyfields youngest green transfused in silver shining through fairer than the lily than the wild white cherry fair as in image my seraph love appears borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears could i find a place to be alone with heaven i would speak my heart out heaven is my need every woodland tree is flushing like the dog-wood flashing like the whitebeam swaying like the reed flushing like the dog-wood crimson in october streaming like the flag-reed south-west blown flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted white beam all seem to know what is for heaven alone
travel is a vanishing act only to those who are left behind what the traveler knows is that he accompanies himself unwieldy baggage that can ’ t be checked stolen or lost or mistaken so one took past outposts of empire “ calmly as if in the british museum ” not only her victorian skirts starched shirtwaists and umbrella but her faith in the civilizing mission of women her backaches and insomnia her innocent valor another friend of witch-doctors living on native chop trading tobacco and hooks for fish and fetishes heralded her astonishing arrival under shivering stars by calling “ it ’ s only me ” a third intent on savage customs and to demonstrate that a woman could travel as easily as a man carried a handkerchief damp with wifely tears and only once permitted a tribal chieftain to stroke her long golden hair
varus varus gib mir meine legionen wieder quick on my feet in those novembers of my loneliness i tossed a short pass almost the instant i got the ball right over the head of barrel terry before he knocked me cold when i woke i found myself crying out latin conjugations and the new snow falling at the edge of a green field lemoyne crone had caught the pass while i lay unconscious and raging alone with the fire ghost of catullus the contemptuous graces tossing garlands and hendecasyllabics over the head of cornelius nepos the mastodon the huge volume at the edges of southeast asia this afternoon the quarterbacks and the lines are beginning to fall a spring snow and terrified young men quick on their feet lob one another ’ s skulls across wings of strange birds that are burning themselves alive

a question posed to flannery o'connor as to whether writing programs stifled writers drew the famous tart rejoinder that in her opinion they did n't stifle nearly enough even if as it is often said there are too many of us—poets that is—that the field is too crowded as opposed to too many hedge-fund managers or too many pharmaceutical lobbyists or too many fundamentalists time rejection discouragement and the inevitable practicalities and detours some of them fortuitous as well as wasted energy the slow seepage or sudden shift of interest premature death burdensome debt or better offers usually cure the problem of overpopulation in other words there are plenty of natural predators
it was necessary to move and at this exit the beggar cross-legged at the fork of the tunnel calls out love a welcome of sorts the night light fucks the suburb into nightmare familiarity — not like a shrammed nerd touting guided walks and histories that contract imagination for demolition work levelling today 's housing restoring common greens lingering at sites orphaned of their fever hospitals — by no means that hyperliterate poor entrepreneur — it is the view the barbed wire roaring into view round and round the playground walltop it is the warehouse warehouse windows blank of occupation it is lives lives supplied in great number fulfilment of numbers it is the sense of something shared — the tailor scissors razoring open fishmouth stitches the sewn-up pocket of the new suit and finding something — but it is new all new even the gangs who graffiti chimneys scrubbed and lovely deleted like the railways delete repeatedly the head the occasionally payrolled head the feet of the quartered commuters of the vertebral week
was it pascal who said “ almost all our misery has come from not being able to remain alone in our rooms ” baudelaire thought it might have been but was not sure and let ’ s take a look at that “ almost ” which i ’ m very glad is there i can think of lots of misery that had nothing to do with my not having been alone in my room when i get a rejection email on a train for a piece of work i had high hopes for is one example or to go way back when i returned home to find my white mouse dead when i was eleven or twelve or to take a mundane example when a plane i ’ m booked on is twelve hours delayed while i hang about the airport i have never had a huge problem with solitude it is true as a child i read voraciously and would find some hidden corner to lurk with my book the game of golf is one where one can enjoy being alone especially very early on a beautiful morning the time when i most felt alone was when the missionaries came to my school and we all had to endure a silent retreat for three days at the end of that time i felt like one of those astronauts in films who have to stay on the moon for months baudelaire claimed his friend the devil loved bleak solitary places where the spirit of murder and lust was more likely to ignite he decided that this was not really a danger for most of us though only for those idle fanciful folk prone to enigmas and dreaming the type of person who should most avoid being alone is a chatterbox or maybe a television pundit but what ’ s to stop these people being verbose in their own company did crusoe for example stay quiet on his island before friday came according to elizabeth bishop in her great poem “ crusoe in england ” he did not and in order to write that poem ms. bishop needed to be alone this did not stop her from cooking meals and inviting friends to help her eat the food and drink wine with her after this probably the next morning she went back to the poem and her solitude i feel the french maybe exaggerate the benefits of being alone that philosopher and writer jean-paul sartre for example his play huis-clos with its famous line “ l ’ enfer c ’ est les autres. ” yes we all know how annoying other people often are and how strong the urge to escape from them can be but the two characters vladimir and estragon in beckett ’ s waiting for godot show that even in an absurdist setting companionship has its importance it ’ s said beckett got his inspiration for this play from one or other of two versions of caspar david friedrich ’ s painting two men contemplating the moon which he saw on a trip to germany in 1936 or ’ 37 in both versions of the painting one of the men has his hand on the other man ’ s shoulder a sign of companionship if ever there was one baudelaire quotes the french philosopher and moralist jean de la bruyère or delabruyère as the man signed himself “ what a great misfortune we can not be alone ” as if to chastise anyone who wants to plunge into a crowd or go into a busy bar what about the great french word fraternité the third of the three words that were the rallying cry of the revolution i want to close this by giving another quote from de la bruyère “ out of difficulties grow miracles. ” i prefer this one anyone in an awkward social situation should dwell on that

we passed old farmer boothby in the field rugged and straight he stood his body steeled with stubbornness and age we met his eyes that never flinched or turned to compromise and “ luck ” he cried “ good luck ” —and waved an arm knotted and sailor-like such as no farm in all of maine could boast of and away he turned again to pitch his new-cut hay ... we walked on leisurely until a bend showed him once more now working toward the end of one great path wearing his eighty years like banners lifted in a wind of cheers then we turned off abruptly—took the road cutting the village the one with the commanding view of the river and we strode more briskly now to the long pier that showed where the frail boats were kept at indian landing in the canoe we stepped our paddles dipped leisurely downwards and the slim bark slipped more on than in the water smoothly then we shot its nose against the rippling current feeling the rising river ’ s half-deterrent pull on the paddle as we turned the blade to keep from swerving round while we delayed to watch the curious wave-eaten locks or pass with lazy turns the picnic-rocks ... blue eels flew under us and fishes darted a thousand ways the once broad channel shrunk and over us the wise and noble-hearted twilight leaned down the sunset mists were parted — and we with thoughts on tiptoe slunk down the green twisting alleys of the kennebunk motionless in the meadows the trees the rocks the cows ... and quiet dripped from the shadows like rain from heavy boughs the tree-toads started ringing their ceaseless silver bells a land-locked breeze came swinging its censer of earthy smells the river ’ s tiny cañon stretched into dusky lands like a dark and silent companion evening held out her hands hushed were the dawn ’ s bravados loud noon was a silenced cry— and quiet slipped from the shadows as stars slip out of the sky ... it must have been an hour more or later when tramping homeward through the piney wood we felt the years fly back the brotherhood of forests took us—and we saw the satyr there in a pool up to his neck he stood and grinned to see us stare incredulous— too startled to remember fear or flight feeling the menace in the crafty night we turned to run—when lo he called to us using our very names he called we drew with creaking courage down the avenue of birches till we saw with clearing sight no longer through a tricky pale-green light familiar turns and shrubs the friendly path — and farmer boothby in his woodland bath the woods became his background every tree seemed part of him and stood erect and shared the beauty of that gnarled serenity the quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared its shoulders against time ... and even night flowed in and out of him as though content with such a native element happy to move about a spirit quite as old as placid and as confident ... sideways we turned still glistening and unclad he leaped up on the bank light as a lad his body in the moonlight dripping stars ... we went on homeward through the pasture-bars

up in the billboard over old south station the captain all wide grin and ruddy cheek held up a golden shot of cutty sark high as the skyline where the sunset spread a gold fan from the twig-like spars and rigging of a departing clipper ship above the picture the dull haze of a real sun rose dragging the day up with it seven o ’ clock the agitated horns brakes fingers and catcalls down below me were already merging and channeling everybody on to warehouse factory department store and office my father and uncle talking over all the goods to be received that day the goods delivered their two reflections in the window floating like blurry ghosts within the captain ’ s grin their voices raised a little above the soft erratic humming of the big machines the riveters and pressers warming rousing the century order did it get out last night and had the buckles come from personal who ’ d go do jaffey who ’ d diddle abramowitz and saperstein those cocksucking sons of bitches cut their balls off if they fuck with us how automatically at any provocation i can aim the words at anybody now woman or man the reverberating angry this not that in ‘ pussy ’ ‘ cocksucker ’ ‘ fuckhead ’ hammered down so far inside me it ’ s almost too securely there to feel but i was thirteen then and for the first time old enough to have my father say these things in front of me which must have meant i was a man now too i listened blushing ashamed of blushing for clues of what it was i had become or was supposed to be it did and didn ’ t have to do with bodies being a man it wasn ’ t fixed in bodies but somehow passed between them going to by being taken from ever departing ever arriving unstoppable as money and moving in a limited supply it seemed to follow where the money went being a man was something that you did to other men which meant a woman was what other men became when you would do them either you gave a fucking or you took one did or were done to it was simple as that somebody shouted from beyond the office that tony had passed out in the can again ‘ the lush the no good lush ’ my uncle said ‘ get him the fuck out of here for good will ya. ’ the stall door swung back scrawled with giant cocks tits asses and cunts beyond which in the shadows my father was gently wrestling with the man trying to hold him steady while his free hand shimmied the tangled shorts and trousers up over the knees and hips and even got the shirt tucked in the pants zipped deftly enough for tony not to notice though he did even then i knew they ’ d fire him and that it wasn ’ t gratitude at all that made the man weep inconsolably his head bowed nodding as my father led him to the elevator still with his arm around him patting his shoulder easing him through the door i knew the tenderness that somewhere else could possibly have been a lover ’ s or a father ’ s could here be only an efficient way to minimize the trouble and yet it seemed somehow my father was too adept at it too skillful not to feel it in some way and feeling it not to need to pull back to separate himself from what the rest of him was doing which was why i think his face throughout was blank expressionless like the faces of the presidents on the bills he handed tony as the door slid shut the men fast at the riveters and pressers and the long row of women at the singers were oil now even more than men or women mute oil in the loud revving of the place a blur of hands on automatic pilot slipping leather through the pumping needles under the thrusting rods the furious hammers the nearly invisible whirring of the blades ‘ come on now al it ’ s time ’ my father said and the captain seemed to grin a little wider as if his pleasure there at the end of his unending day grew freer more disencumbered because he saw me at the start of mine under my father ’ s arm his soft voice broken against the noise into an unfollowable tune of favors and petty cash and how much ass he had to kiss to get me this and i should be a man now and not disappoint him
applying to heavy equipment school i marched farther into the great plains and refused to come out i threw up a few scaffolds of disinterest around me in the fields the hogs grunted and lay on their sides you came with a little water and went away the glass is still on the table and the paper and the burned scaffolds you were bent over the sink washing your stockings i came up behind you like the night sky behind the town you stood frowning at your knuckles and did not speak at night i lie still like bolivia my furnaces turn blue my forests go dark you are a low range of hills a paraguay now the clouds cover us both it is raining and the movie houses are open

—barrio rené cisneros managua nicaragua june-july 1982 this was the dictator ’ s land before the revolution now the dictator is exiled to necropolis his army brooding in camps on the border and the congregation of the landless stipples the earth with a thousand shacks every weatherbeaten carpenter planting a fistful of nails here i dig latrines i dig because last week i saw a funeral in the streets of managua the coffin swaddled in a red and black flag hoisted by a procession so silent that even their feet seemed to leave no sound on the gravel he was eighteen with the border patrol when a sharpshooter from the dictator ’ s army took aim at the back of his head i dig because yesterday i saw four walls of photographs the faces of volunteers in high school uniforms who taught campesinos to read bringing an alphabet sandwiched in notebooks to places where the mist never rises from the trees all dead by malaria or the greedy river or the dictator ’ s army swarming the illiterate villages like a sky full of corn-plundering birds i dig because today in this barrio without plumbing i saw a woman wearing a yellow dress climb into a barrel of water to wash herself and the dress at the same time her cupped hands spilling i dig because today i stopped digging to drink an orange soda in a country with no glass the boy kept the treasured bottle and poured the liquid into a plastic bag full of ice then poked a hole with a straw i dig because today my shovel struck a clay bowl centuries old the art of ancient fingers moist with this same earth perfect but for one crack in the lip i dig because i have hauled garbage and pumped gas and cut paper and sold encyclopedias door to door i dig digging until the passport in my back pocket saturates with dirt because here i work for nothing and for everything
as a kid sitting in a yellow vinyl booth in the back of earl ’ s tavern you watch the late-afternoon drunks coming and going sunlight breaking through the smoky dark as the door opens and closes and it ’ s the future flashing ahead like the taillights of a semi as you drop over a rise in the road on your way to amarillo bright lights and blonde-haired women as billy used to say slumped over his beer like a snail make a real man out of you the smile bleak as the gaps between his teeth stay loose son don ’ t die before you ’ re dead always the warnings from men you worked with before they broke blue fingernails eyes red as fate a different life for me you think and outside later feeling young and strong enough to raise the sun back up you stare down highway 54 pushing everything—stars sky moon all but a thin line at the edge of the world—behind you your headlights sweep across the tavern window ripping the dark from the small humped shapes of men inside who turn and look like small animals caught in the glare of your lights on the road to amarillo

the miller 's wife had waited long the tea was cold the fire was dead and there might yet be nothing wrong in how he went and what he said '' there are no millers any more '' was all that she had heard him say and he had lingered at the door so long that it seemed yesterday sick with a fear that had no form she knew that she was there at last and in the mill there was a warm and mealy fragrance of the past what else there was would only seem to say again what he had meant and what was hanging from a beam would not have heeded where she went and if she thought it followed her she may have reasoned in the dark that one way of the few there were would hide her and would leave no mark black water smooth above the weir like starry velvet in the night though ruffled once would soon appear the same as ever to the sight

there ’ s a crack in this glass so fine we can ’ t see it and in the blue eye of the candleflame ’ s needle there ’ s a dark fleck a speck of imperfection that could contain like a microchip an epic treatise on beauty except it ’ s in the eye of the beheld and at the base of our glass there ’ s nothing so big as a tiny puddle but an ooze a viscous patina like liquefied tarnish it ’ s like a text so short it consists only of the author ’ s signature which has to stand like the future for what might have been a novel let ’ s say thick with ambiguous life its hero forgets his goal as he nears it so that it ’ s like rain evaporating in the very sight of parched saharans on the desert floor there by chance he meets a thirsty and beautiful woman what a small world
on this first day of spring snow covers the fruit trees mingling improbably with the new blossoms like identical twins brought up in different hemispheres it is not what housman meant when he wrote of the cherry hung with snow though he also knew how death can mistake the seasons and if he made it all sound pretty that was our misreading in those high school classrooms where drunk on boredom we had to recite his poems now the weather is always looming in the background trying to become more than merely scenery and though today it is telling us something we do n't want to hear it is all so unpredictable so out of control that we might as well be children again hearing the voices of thunder like baritone uncles shouting in the next room as we try to sleep or hearing the silence of snow falling soft as a coverlet even in springtime whispering relax there is nothing you can possibly do about any of this
this high up the face eroding the red cedar slopes over an accident chooses a stranger each rain unplugs roots which thin out like a hand above the river heat lightning flicks silently and the sound holds coiled in air some nights you are here dangling a valpolicella bottle staring down at the flat water that slides by with its mouth full of starlight it is always quiet when we finish the wine while you were a living man how many pictures were done of you serious as an angel lacing up your boots ice blows into my fields
as our daughter approaches graduation and puberty at the same time at her own calm deliberate serious rate she begins to kick up her heels jazz out her hands thrust out her hipbones chant i ’ m great i ’ m great she feels 8th grade coming open around her a chrysalis cracking and letting her out it falls behind her and joins the other husks on the ground 7th grade 6th grade the magenta rind of 5th grade the hard jacket of 4th when she had so much pain 3rd grade 2nd the dim cocoon of 1st grade back there somewhere on the path and kindergarten like a strip of thumb-suck blanket taken from the actual blanket they wrapped her in at birth the whole school is coming off her shoulders like a cloak unclasped and she dances forth in her jerky sexy child ’ s joke dance of self self her throat tight and a hard new song coming out of it while her two dark eyes shine above her body like a good mother and a good father who look down and love everything their baby does the way she lives their love

we can not kindle when we will the fire which in the heart resides the spirit bloweth and is still in mystery our soul abides but tasks in hours of insight will'd can be through hours of gloom fulfill 'd with aching hands and bleeding feet we dig and heap lay stone on stone we bear the burden and the heat of the long day and wish 'twere done not till the hours of light return all we have built do we discern then when the clouds are off the soul when thou dost bask in nature 's eye ask how she view 'd thy self-control thy struggling task 'd morality— nature whose free light cheerful air oft made thee in thy gloom despair and she whose censure thou dost dread whose eye thou wast afraid to seek see on her face a glow is spread a strong emotion on her cheek `` ah child '' she cries `` that strife divine whence was it for it is not mine `` there is no effort on my brow— i do not strive i do not weep i rush with the swift spheres and glow in joy and when i will i sleep yet that severe that earnest air i saw i felt it once—but where `` i knew not yet the gauge of time nor wore the manacles of space i felt it in some other clime i saw it in some other place 't was when the heavenly house i trod and lay upon the breast of god ''
tempora labuntur tacitisque senescimus annis et fugiunt freno non remorante dies ovid fastorum lib vi `` o cæsar we who are about to die salute you '' was the gladiators cry in the arena standing face to face with death and with the roman populace o ye familiar scenes —ye groves of pine that once were mine and are no longer mine — thou river widening through the meadows green to the vast sea so near and yet unseen — ye halls in whose seclusion and repose phantoms of fame like exhalations rose and vanished —we who are about to die salute you earth and air and sea and sky and the imperial sun that scatters down his sovereign splendors upon grove and town ye do not answer us ye do not hear we are forgotten and in your austere and calm indifference ye little care whether we come or go or whence or where what passing generations fill these halls what passing voices echo from these walls ye heed not we are only as the blast a moment heard and then forever past not so the teachers who in earlier days led our bewildered feet through learning 's maze they answer us—alas what have i said what greetings come there from the voiceless dead what salutation welcome or reply what pressure from the hands that lifeless lie they are no longer here they all are gone into the land of shadows —all save one honor and reverence and the good repute that follows faithful service as its fruit be unto him whom living we salute the great italian poet when he made his dreadful journey to the realms of shade met there the old instructor of his youth and cried in tones of pity and of ruth '' oh never from the memory of my heart your dear paternal image shall depart who while on earth ere yet by death surprised taught me how mortals are immortalized how grateful am i for that patient care all my life long my language shall declare '' to-day we make the poet 's words our own and utter them in plaintive undertone nor to the living only be they said but to the other living called the dead whose dear paternal images appear not wrapped in gloom but robed in sunshine here whose simple lives complete and without flaw were part and parcel of great nature 's law who said not to their lord as if afraid '' here is thy talent in a napkin laid '' but labored in their sphere as men who live in the delight that work alone can give peace be to them eternal peace and rest and the fulfilment of the great behest '' ye have been faithful over a few things over ten cities shall ye reign as kings '' and ye who fill the places we once filled and follow in the furrows that we tilled young men whose generous hearts are beating high we who are old and are about to die salute you hail you take your hands in ours and crown you with our welcome as with flowers how beautiful is youth how bright it gleams with its illusions aspirations dreams book of beginnings story without end each maid a heroine and each man a friend aladdin 's lamp and fortunatus purse that holds the treasures of the universe all possibilities are in its hands no danger daunts it and no foe withstands in its sublime audacity of faith '' be thou removed '' it to the mountain saith and with ambitious feet secure and proud ascends the ladder leaning on the cloud as ancient priam at the scæan gate sat on the walls of troy in regal state with the old men too old and weak to fight chirping like grasshoppers in their delight to see the embattled hosts with spear and shield of trojans and achaians in the field so from the snowy summits of our years we see you in the plain as each appears and question of you asking `` who is he that towers above the others which may be atreides menelaus odysseus ajax the great or bold idomeneus '' let him not boast who puts his armor on as he who puts it off the battle done study yourselves and most of all note well wherein kind nature meant you to excel not every blossom ripens into fruit minerva the inventress of the flute flung it aside when she her face surveyed distorted in a fountain as she played the unlucky marsyas found it and his fate was one to make the bravest hesitate write on your doors the saying wise and old '' be bold be bold '' and everywhere `` be bold be not too bold '' yet better the excess than the defect better the more than less better like hector in the field to die than like a perfumed paris turn and fly and now my classmates ye remaining few that number not the half of those we knew ye against whose familiar names not yet the fatal asterisk of death is set ye i salute the horologe of time strikes the half-century with a solemn chime and summons us together once again the joy of meeting not unmixed with pain where are the others voices from the deep caverns of darkness answer me `` they sleep '' i name no names instinctively i feel each at some well-remembered grave will kneel and from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss for every heart best knoweth its own loss i see their scattered gravestones gleaming white through the pale dusk of the impending night o'er all alike the impartial sunset throws its golden lilies mingled with the rose we give to each a tender thought and pass out of the graveyards with their tangled grass unto these scenes frequented by our feet when we were young and life was fresh and sweet what shall i say to you what can i say better than silence is when i survey this throng of faces turned to meet my own friendly and fair and yet to me unknown transformed the very landscape seems to be it is the same yet not the same to me so many memories crowd upon my brain so many ghosts are in the wooded plain i fain would steal away with noiseless tread as from a house where some one lieth dead i can not go —i pause —i hesitate my feet reluctant linger at the gate as one who struggles in a troubled dream to speak and can not to myself i seem vanish the dream vanish the idle fears vanish the rolling mists of fifty years whatever time or space may intervene i will not be a stranger in this scene here every doubt all indecision ends hail my companions comrades classmates friends ah me the fifty years since last we met seem to me fifty folios bound and set by time the great transcriber on his shelves wherein are written the histories of ourselves what tragedies what comedies are there what joy and grief what rapture and despair what chronicles of triumph and defeat of struggle and temptation and retreat what records of regrets and doubts and fears what pages blotted blistered by our tears what lovely landscapes on the margin shine what sweet angelic faces what divine and holy images of love and trust undimmed by age unsoiled by damp or dust whose hand shall dare to open and explore these volumes closed and clasped forevermore not mine with reverential feet i pass i hear a voice that cries `` alas alas whatever hath been written shall remain nor be erased nor written o'er again the unwritten only still belongs to thee take heed and ponder well what that shall be '' as children frightened by a thunder-cloud are reassured if some one reads aloud a tale of wonder with enchantment fraught or wild adventure that diverts their thought let me endeavor with a tale to chase the gathering shadows of the time and place and banish what we all too deeply feel wholly to say or wholly to conceal in mediæval rome i know not where there stood an image with its arm in air and on its lifted finger shining clear a golden ring with the device `` strike here '' greatly the people wondered though none guessed the meaning that these words but half expressed until a learned clerk who at noonday with downcast eyes was passing on his way paused and observed the spot and marked it well whereon the shadow of the finger fell and coming back at midnight delved and found a secret stairway leading underground down this he passed into a spacious hall lit by a flaming jewel on the wall and opposite in threatening attitude with bow and shaft a brazen statue stood upon its forehead like a coronet were these mysterious words of menace set '' that which i am i am my fatal aim none can escape not even yon luminous flame '' midway the hall was a fair table placed with cloth of gold and golden cups enchased with rubies and the plates and knives were gold and gold the bread and viands manifold around it silent motionless and sad were seated gallant knights in armor clad and ladies beautiful with plume and zone but they were stone their hearts within were stone and the vast hall was filled in every part with silent crowds stony in face and heart long at the scene bewildered and amazed the trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed then from the table by his greed made bold he seized a goblet and a knife of gold and suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang the vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang the archer sped his arrow at their call shattering the lambent jewel on the wall and all was dark around and overhead — stark on the floor the luckless clerk lay dead the writer of this legend then records its ghostly application in these words the image is the adversary old whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold our lusts and passions are the downward stair that leads the soul from a diviner air the archer death the flaming jewel life terrestrial goods the goblet and the knife the knights and ladies all whose flesh and bone by avarice have been hardened into stone the clerk the scholar whom the love of pelf tempts from his books and from his nobler self the scholar and the world the endless strife the discord in the harmonies of life the love of learning the sequestered nooks and all the sweet serenity of books the market-place the eager love of gain whose aim is vanity and whose end is pain but why you ask me should this tale be told to men grown old or who are growing old it is too late ah nothing is too late till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate cato learned greek at eighty sophocles wrote his grand oedipus and simonides bore off the prize of verse from his compeers when each had numbered more than fourscore years and theophrastus at fourscore and ten had but begun his `` characters of men '' chaucer at woodstock with the nightingales at sixty wrote the canterbury tales goethe at weimar toiling to the last completed faust when eighty years were past these are indeed exceptions but they show how far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow into the arctic regions of our lives where little else than life itself survives as the barometer foretells the storm while still the skies are clear the weather warm so something in us as old age draws near betrays the pressure of the atmosphere the nimble mercury ere we are aware descends the elastic ladder of the air the telltale blood in artery and vein sinks from its higher levels in the brain whatever poet orator or sage may say of it old age is still old age it is the waning not the crescent moon the dusk of evening not the blaze of noon it is not strength but weakness not desire but its surcease not the fierce heat of fire the burning and consuming element but that of ashes and of embers spent in which some living sparks we still discern enough to warm but not enough to burn what then shall we sit idly down and say the night hath come it is no longer day the night hath not yet come we are not quite cut off from labor by the failing light something remains for us to do or dare even the oldest tree some fruit may bear not oedipus coloneus or greek ode or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode out of the gateway of the tabard inn but other something would we but begin for age is opportunity no less than youth itself though in another dress and as the evening twilight fades away the sky is filled with stars invisible by day
why do we bother with the rest of the day the swale of the afternoon the sudden dip into evening then night with his notorious perfumes his many-pointed stars this is the best— throwing off the light covers feet on the cold floor and buzzing around the house on espresso— maybe a splash of water on the face a palmful of vitamins— but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso dictionary and atlas open on the rug the typewriter waiting for the key of the head a cello on the radio and if necessary the windows— trees fifty a hundred years old out there heavy clouds on the way and the lawn steaming like a horse in the early morning

most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes to pace the ground if path be there or none while a fair region round the traveller lies which he forbears again to look upon pleased rather with some soft ideal scene the work of fancy or some happy tone of meditation slipping in between the beauty coming and the beauty gone if thought and love desert us from that day let us break off all commerce with the muse with thought and love companions of our way whate'er the senses take or may refuse the mind 's internal heaven shall shed her dews of inspiration on the humblest lay

my mind was once the true survey of all these meadows fresh and gay and in the greenness of the grass did see its hopes as in a glass when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me but these while i with sorrow pine grew more luxuriant still and fine that not one blade of grass you spy ’ d but had a flower on either side when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me unthankful meadows could you so a fellowship so true forgo and in your gaudy may-games meet while i lay trodden under feet when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me but what you in compassion ought shall now by my revenge be wrought and flow ’ rs and grass and i and all will in one common ruin fall for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me and thus ye meadows which have been companions of my thoughts more green shall now the heraldry become with which i shall adorn my tomb for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me
luxurious man to bring his vice in use did after him the world seduce and from the fields the flow ’ rs and plants allure where nature was most plain and pure he first enclos ’ d within the garden ’ s square a dead and standing pool of air and a more luscious earth for them did knead which stupefied them while it fed the pink grew then as double as his mind the nutriment did change the kind with strange perfumes he did the roses taint and flow ’ rs themselves were taught to paint the tulip white did for complexion seek and learn ’ d to interline its cheek its onion root they then so high did hold that one was for a meadow sold another world was search ’ d through oceans new to find the marvel of peru and yet these rarities might be allow ’ d to man that sov ’ reign thing and proud had he not dealt between the bark and tree forbidden mixtures there to see no plant now knew the stock from which it came he grafts upon the wild the tame that the uncertain and adult ’ rate fruit might put the palate in dispute his green seraglio has its eunuchs too lest any tyrant him out-do and in the cherry he does nature vex to procreate without a sex ’ tis all enforc ’ d the fountain and the grot while the sweet fields do lie forgot where willing nature does to all dispense a wild and fragrant innocence and fauns and fairies do the meadows till more by their presence than their skill their statues polish ’ d by some ancient hand may to adorn the gardens stand but howso ’ ere the figures do excel the gods themselves with us do dwell

old eben flood climbing alone one night over the hill between the town below and the forsaken upland hermitage that held as much as he should ever know on earth again of home paused warily the road was his with not a native near and eben having leisure said aloud for no man else in tilbury town to hear '' well mr. flood we have the harvest moon again and we may not have many more the bird is on the wing the poet says and you and i have said it here before drink to the bird '' he raised up to the light the jug that he had gone so far to fill and answered huskily `` well mr. flood since you propose it i believe i will '' alone as if enduring to the end a valiant armor of scarred hopes outworn he stood there in the middle of the road like roland 's ghost winding a silent horn below him in the town among the trees where friends of other days had honored him a phantom salutation of the dead rang thinly till old eben 's eyes were dim then as a mother lays her sleeping child down tenderly fearing it may awake he set the jug down slowly at his feet with trembling care knowing that most things break and only when assured that on firm earth it stood as the uncertain lives of men assuredly did not he paced away and with his hand extended paused again '' well mr. flood we have not met like this in a long time and many a change has come to both of us i fear since last it was we had a drop together welcome home '' convivially returning with himself again he raised the jug up to the light and with an acquiescent quaver said '' well mr. flood if you insist i might `` only a very little mr. flood— for auld lang syne no more sir that will do '' so for the time apparently it did and eben evidently thought so too for soon amid the silver loneliness of night he lifted up his voice and sang secure with only two moons listening until the whole harmonious landscape rang— '' for auld lang syne '' the weary throat gave out the last word wavered and the song being done he raised again the jug regretfully and shook his head and was again alone there was not much that was ahead of him and there was nothing in the town below— where strangers would have shut the many doors that many friends had opened long ago
amid the iris and the rose the honeysuckle and the bay the wild earth for a moment goes in dust or weed another way small though its corner be the weed will yet intrude its creeping beard the harsh blade and the hairy seed recall the brutal earth we feared and if no water touch the dust in some far corner and one dare to breathe upon it one may trust the spectre on the summer air the risen dust alive with fire the fire made visible a blur interrate the pervasive ire of foxtail and of hoarhound burr
i watch the woods for deer as if i ’ m armed i watch the woods for deer who never come i know the hes and shes in autumn rendezvous in orchards stained with fallen apples ’ scent i drive my car this way to work so i may let the crows in corn believe it ’ s me their caws are meant to warn and snakes who turn in warm and secret caves they know me too they know the boy who lives inside me still won ’ t go away the deer are ghosts who slip between the light through trees so you may only hear the snap of branches in the thicket beyond hope i watch the woods for deer as if i ’ m armed
for richard hugo you hear the roadhouse before you see it its four-beat country tunes amplified like surf through the woods silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk setting beards of moss dancing on dim indeterminate trees that border two-lane blacktop docked tonight you reveal the badge of the farmer that blanched expanse of skin where cap shades face babyhood pallor above the sun-blackened jaw bulging uneasy with a concrete grin and some inevitable need to weep don ’ t you think we live and breathe in the meantime in lockstep with dawn sunset brawling dawn even now you await secrets worse than the few known ways a seized sky will come to survive your pity but on another far field celebrated for its arrivals and evictions you learn to be beautiful never leading a sensible life playing ball in the early dark fighting for a taste of the sweet spot in this uncut land this straight-edged air whadya want to know that isn ’ t yet a mystery somewhere a confidential stumble heat lightning a first-rate backseat turndown so it is that later you track high above familiar tamarack and ash beginning the next inaccuracy alone and again remembering that everything east of you has already happened on the same cold ground in a swarm of time finally spiked home to your surprise nails flung to the air and us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks you hear from the roadhouse before you see it
and it was political i made coffee and the coffee was political i took a shower and the water was i walked down the street in short shorts and a bob mizer tank top and they were political the walking and the shorts and the beefcake silkscreen of the man posing in a g-string i forgot my sunglasses and later on the train that was political when i studied every handsome man in the car who i thought was handsome was political i went to work at the university and everything was very obviously political the department and the institution all the cigarettes i smoked between classes were political where i threw them when i was through i was blond and it was political so was the difference between “ blond ” and “ blonde. ” i had long hair and it was political i shaved my head and it was that i didn ’ t know how to grieve when another person was killed in america was political and it was political when america killed another person who they were and what color and gender and who i am in relation i couldn ’ t think about it for too long without feeling a helplessness like childhood i was a child and it was political being a boy who was bad at it i couldn ’ t catch and so the ball became political my mother read to me almost every night and the conditions that enabled her to do so were political that my father ’ s money was new was political that it was proving something someone called me faggot and it was political i called myself a faggot and it was political how difficult my life felt relative to how difficult it was was political i thought i could become a writer and it was political that i could imagine it i thought i was not a political poet and still my imagination was political it had been this whole time i was asleep
they so liked breast milk joanne fell asleep leaked the ants woke up made the sweet climb others were surprised to find acidophilus soledad cleansing her inside sex — they made their way across her ivory sheets while she napped ah the little guys were rejected by our sisters but still i feel sad that in my new lodgings there are no more glossy arrowheads to follow sprinkle with baking powder make a pretty cayenne path for over the once-food-strewn sill they scent our past they can carry their groceries bag-free ants shop in the honey cupboard thirst like black hair being washed in a sink car-waxed black traffic jam — that ’ s actual jam strawberry once my curatorial staff but let them go on strike those embodiments of intention they don ’ t sit around playing cards perhaps they never play never horse around hard-to-see-in-the-dark jet numbers on the radio dial perhaps there is no laughter in their chasm serious but they ’ re able to stand up on hind legs — a darling trick i want to give them a little inkwell a beachball the number of communal legs alone exceeds the stars underground they could be an orchestra a single one looks in the mirror sees a note a quarter note so many instincts massing as one if i miss one little lover do i miss them all
i was walking from the louvre to place saint-michel along the seine when i noticed a crowd gathered under a large linden tree as i approached i thought how much i ’ d liked to walk down unter den linden when i ’ d lived in berlin and now i saw again how attractive the light green seeds of the linden tree were against the darker green of the leaves i was also agog to see what had caused the crowd to gather as i neared i heard a mother say to her little boy “ regardez sébastien les saltimbanques. ” saltimbanques this was a new word to me i had a quick look on my iphone and came up with the translation “ mountebank. ” i pushed my way as politely as possible through the crowd until i had a good view it was a family of street performers they had improvised a small stage on the wide pavement and a father mother and ten-year-old or so boy were up there the man was dressed in a striking yellow and blue outfit with white leggings and black shoes and was banging a little drum rhythmically while the boy in a checked black-and-white jumpsuit capered about playing thumb rolls on a tambourine with a black-and-white dog dancing in perfect step alongside him the woman dressed all in white sat on a stool playing quick dance music on a red tin whistle on her head was a white floppy hat sitting on which was a snowy owl who periodically flew in a circle over the heads of the crowd coming back to land on the white hat it was a scene worthy of being painted by the young picasso or the old chagall or maybe by gustave doré the boy on stage didn ’ t look in the best of health but i hoped i was wrong the effect of the whole performance was strange and utterly charming and the little troupe seemed to have emerged from another era — from that of baudelaire even i was puzzled by the translation offered by my iphone however what i understood by the english word “ mountebank ” which seemed very archaic was either a person who sold quack medicines in public places or a charlatan these performers were no fakes and yet the english word like the french seemed to suggest the jumping up onto a stage i ’ d have to revisit my shakespeare plays — i seemed to remember that he ’ d liked using that word when the white hat came round i put a €20 note into it took a quick photograph of les saltimbanques and made my way to the nearest metro i was almost surprised to see cars and motorbikes clogging the road
a snail sank — grand in puss and rime on three coils equals one tea-wheel white the wheel brings the bill the bill — bald everyone goes in for the table the tablecloth is of water one says huh — one morning high on a grape i dropped off — a dunce — and exacted my height and rightly so it is a height i won ’ t have made alone it is a height erring on all sides the bride slip ’ n slides on her back to us — then on her head a ball-point pen quicksand in her hair a man beside her his mouth is like a dark arch for her my mouth is death to you in this new rhythm how can i say how can i thank you for i feel a blessing running through my tale now it shines — intestines — that i will can

my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk or emptied some dull opiate to the drains one minute past and lethe-wards had sunk 'tis not through envy of thy happy lot but being too happy in thine happiness — that thou light-winged dryad of the trees in some melodious plot of beechen green and shadows numberless singest of summer in full-throated ease o for a draught of vintage that hath been cool 'd a long age in the deep-delved earth tasting of flora and the country green dance and provençal song and sunburnt mirth o for a beaker full of the warm south full of the true the blushful hippocrene with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purple-stained mouth that i might drink and leave the world unseen and with thee fade away into the forest dim fade far away dissolve and quite forget what thou among the leaves hast never known the weariness the fever and the fret here where men sit and hear each other groan where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs where youth grows pale and spectre-thin and dies where but to think is to be full of sorrow and leaden-eyed despairs where beauty can not keep her lustrous eyes or new love pine at them beyond to-morrow away away for i will fly to thee not charioted by bacchus and his pards but on the viewless wings of poesy though the dull brain perplexes and retards already with thee tender is the night and haply the queen-moon is on her throne cluster 'd around by all her starry fays but here there is no light save what from heaven is with the breezes blown through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways i can not see what flowers are at my feet nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs but in embalmed darkness guess each sweet wherewith the seasonable month endows the grass the thicket and the fruit-tree wild white hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine fast fading violets cover 'd up in leaves and mid-may 's eldest child the coming musk-rose full of dewy wine the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves darkling i listen and for many a time i have been half in love with easeful death call 'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme to take into the air my quiet breath now more than ever seems it rich to die to cease upon the midnight with no pain while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy still wouldst thou sing and i have ears in vain— to thy high requiem become a sod thou wast not born for death immortal bird no hungry generations tread thee down the voice i hear this passing night was heard in ancient days by emperor and clown perhaps the self-same song that found a path through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home she stood in tears amid the alien corn the same that oft-times hath charm 'd magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn forlorn the very word is like a bell to toll me back from thee to my sole self adieu the fancy can not cheat so well as she is fam 'd to do deceiving elf adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades past the near meadows over the still stream up the hill-side and now 't is buried deep in the next valley-glades was it a vision or a waking dream fled is that music —do i wake or sleep
the heavy bodies lunge the broken language of fake and drive glamorous jump shot slowed to a stutter their gestures in love again with the pure geometry of curves rise toward the ball falter and fall away on the boards their hands and fingertips tremble in tense little prayers of reach and balance then the grind of bone and socket the caught breath the sigh the grunt of the body laboring to give birth to itself in their toiling and grand sweeps i wonder do they still make love to their wives kissing the undersides of their wrists dancing the old soft-shoe of desire and on the long walk home from the vfw do they still sing to the drunken moon stands full clock moving the one in army fatigues and houseshoes says to himself pick and roll and the phrase sounds musical as ever radio crooning songs of love after the game the girl leaning back in the chevy ’ s front seat as her raven hair flames in the shuddering light of the outdoor movie and now he drives gliding toward the net a glass wand of autumn light breaks over the backboard boys rise up in old men wings begin to sprout at their backs the ball turns in the darkening air
oh the old swimmin'-hole whare the crick so still and deep looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep and the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below sounded like the laugh of something we onc't ust to know before we could remember anything but the eyes of the angels lookin out as we left paradise but the merry days of youth is beyond our controle and it 's hard to part ferever with the old swimmin'-hole oh the old swimmin'-hole in the happy days of yore when i ust to lean above it on the old sickamore oh it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide that gazed back at me so gay and glorified it made me love myself as i leaped to caress my shadder smilin up at me with sich tenderness but them days is past and gone and old time 's tuck his toll from the old man come back to the old swimmin'-hole oh the old swimmin'-hole in the long lazy days when the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways how plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane you could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole they was lots o fun on hands at the old swimmin'-hole but the lost joys is past let your tears in sorrow roll like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin'-hole thare the bullrushes growed and the cattails so tall and the sunshine and shadder fell over it all and it mottled the worter with amber and gold tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled and the snake-feeder 's four gauzy wings fluttered by like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze 's controle as it cut acrost some orchard to'rds the old swimmin'-hole oh the old swimmin'-hole when i last saw the place the scenes was all changed like the change in my face the bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot and i stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be— but never again will theyr shade shelter me and i wish in my sorrow i could strip to the soul and dive off in my grave like the old swimmin'-hole

oh that those lips had language life has pass'd with me but roughly since i heard thee last those lips are thine—thy own sweet smiles i see the same that oft in childhood solaced me voice only fails else how distinct they say '' grieve not my child chase all thy fears away '' the meek intelligence of those dear eyes blest be the art that can immortalize the art that baffles time 's tyrannic claim to quench it here shines on me still the same faithful remembrancer of one so dear oh welcome guest though unexpected here who bidd'st me honour with an artless song affectionate a mother lost so long i will obey not willingly alone but gladly as the precept were her own and while that face renews my filial grief fancy shall weave a charm for my relief— shall steep me in elysian reverie a momentary dream that thou art she my mother when i learn 'd that thou wast dead say wast thou conscious of the tears i shed hover 'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son wretch even then life 's journey just begun perhaps thou gav'st me though unseen a kiss perhaps a tear if souls can weep in bliss— ah that maternal smile it answers—yes i heard the bell toll 'd on thy burial day i saw the hearse that bore thee slow away and turning from my nurs'ry window drew a long long sigh and wept a last adieu but was it such —it was.—where thou art gone adieus and farewells are a sound unknown may i but meet thee on that peaceful shore the parting sound shall pass my lips no more thy maidens griev 'd themselves at my concern oft gave me promise of a quick return what ardently i wish 'd i long believ 'd and disappointed still was still deceiv 'd by disappointment every day beguil 'd dupe of to-morrow even from a child thus many a sad to-morrow came and went till all my stock of infant sorrow spent i learn 'd at last submission to my lot but though i less deplor 'd thee ne'er forgot where once we dwelt our name is heard no more children not thine have trod my nurs'ry floor and where the gard'ner robin day by day drew me to school along the public way delighted with my bauble coach and wrapt in scarlet mantle warm and velvet capt 'tis now become a history little known that once we call 'd the past'ral house our own short-liv 'd possession but the record fair that mem'ry keeps of all thy kindness there still outlives many a storm that has effac'd a thousand other themes less deeply trac 'd thy nightly visits to my chamber made that thou might'st know me safe and warmly laid thy morning bounties ere i left my home the biscuit or confectionary plum the fragrant waters on my cheeks bestow'd by thy own hand till fresh they shone and glow 'd all this and more endearing still than all thy constant flow of love that knew no fall ne'er roughen 'd by those cataracts and brakes that humour interpos 'd too often makes all this still legible in mem'ry 's page and still to be so to my latest age adds joy to duty makes me glad to pay such honours to thee as my numbers may perhaps a frail memorial but sincere not scorn 'd in heav'n though little notic 'd here could time his flight revers 'd restore the hours when playing with thy vesture 's tissued flow'rs the violet the pink and jessamine i prick 'd them into paper with a pin and thou wast happier than myself the while would'st softly speak and stroke my head and smile could those few pleasant hours again appear might one wish bring them would i wish them here i would not trust my heart—the dear delight seems so to be desir 'd perhaps i might.— but no—what here we call our life is such so little to be lov 'd and thou so much that i should ill requite thee to constrain thy unbound spirit into bonds again thou as a gallant bark from albion 's coast the storms all weather 'd and the ocean cross 'd shoots into port at some well-haven 'd isle where spices breathe and brighter seasons smile there sits quiescent on the floods that show her beauteous form reflected clear below while airs impregnated with incense play around her fanning light her streamers gay so thou with sails how swift hast reach 'd the shore '' where tempests never beat nor billows roar '' and thy lov 'd consort on the dang'rous tide of life long since has anchor 'd at thy side but me scarce hoping to attain that rest always from port withheld always distress'd— me howling winds drive devious tempest toss 'd sails ript seams op'ning wide and compass lost and day by day some current 's thwarting force sets me more distant from a prosp'rous course but oh the thought that thou art safe and he that thought is joy arrive what may to me my boast is not that i deduce my birth from loins enthron 'd and rulers of the earth but higher far my proud pretensions rise— the son of parents pass 'd into the skies and now farewell—time unrevok 'd has run his wonted course yet what i wish 'd is done by contemplation 's help not sought in vain i seem t have liv 'd my childhood o'er again to have renew 'd the joys that once were mine without the sin of violating thine and while the wings of fancy still are free and i can view this mimic shew of thee time has but half succeeded in his theft— thyself remov 'd thy power to sooth me left

how easily happiness begins by dicing onions a lump of sweet butter slithers and swirls across the floor of the sauté pan especially if its errant path crosses a tiny slick of olive oil then a tumble of onions this could mean soup or risotto or chutney from the sanskrit chatni to lick slowly the onions go limp and then nacreous and then what cookbooks call clear though if they were eyes you could see clearly the cataracts in them it ’ s true it can make you weep to peel them to unfurl and to tease from the taut ball first the brittle caramel-colored and decrepit papery outside layer the least recent the reticent onion wrapped around its growing body for there ’ s nothing to an onion but skin and it ’ s true you can go on weeping as you go on in through the moist middle skins the sweetest and thickest and you can go on in to the core to the bud-like acrid fibrous skins densely clustered there stalky and in- complete and these are the most pungent like the nuggets of nightmare and rage and murmury animal comfort that infant humans secrete this is the best domestic perfume you sit down to eat with a rumor of onions still on your twice-washed hands and lift to your mouth a hint of a story about loam and usual endurance it ’ s there when you clean up and rinse the wine glasses and make a joke and you leave the minutest whiff of it on the light switch later when you climb the stairs

over the sea our galleys went with cleaving prows in order brave to a speeding wind and a bounding wave a gallant armament each bark built out of a forest-tree left leafy and rough as first it grew and nailed all over the gaping sides within and without with black bull-hides seethed in fat and suppled in flame to bear the playful billows game so each good ship was rude to see rude and bare to the outward view but each upbore a stately tent where cedar-pales in scented row kept out the flakes of the dancing brine and an awning drooped the mast below in fold on fold of the purple fine that neither noontide nor star-shine nor moonlight cold which maketh mad might pierce the regal tenement when the sun dawned oh gay and glad we set the sail and plied the oar but when the night-wind blew like breath for joy of one day 's voyage more we sang together on the wide sea like men at peace on a peaceful shore each sail was loosed to the wind so free each helm made sure by the twilight star and in a sleep as calm as death we the voyagers from afar lay stretched along each weary crew in a circle round its wondrous tent whence gleamed soft light and curled rich scent and with light and perfume music too so the stars wheeled round and the darkness past and at morn we started beside the mast and still each ship was sailing fast now one morn land appeared —a speck dim trembling betwixt sea and sky '' avoid it '' cried our pilot `` check the shout restrain the eager eye '' but the heaving sea was black behind for many a night and many a day and land though but a rock drew nigh so we broke the cedar pales away let the purple awning flap in the wind and a statue bright was on every deck we shouted every man of us and steered right into the harbour thus with pomp and paean glorious a hundred shapes of lucid stone all day we built its shrine for each a shrine of rock for every one nor paused we till in the westering sun we sat together on the beach to sing because our task was done when lo what shouts and merry songs what laughter all the distance stirs a loaded raft with happy throngs of gentle islanders `` our isles are just at hand '' they cried '' like cloudlets faint in even sleeping our temple-gates are opened wide our olive-groves thick shade are keeping for these majestic forms '' —they cried oh then we awoke with sudden start from our deep dream and knew too late how bare the rock how desolate which had received our precious freight yet we called out— '' depart our gifts once given must here abide our work is done we have no heart to mar our work '' —we cried

who is your lady of love o ye that pass singing and is it for sorrow of that which was that ye sing sadly or dream of what shall be for gladly at once and sadly it seems ye sing — our lady of love by you is unbeholden for hands she hath none nor eyes nor lips nor golden treasure of hair nor face nor form but we that love we know her more fair than anything — is she a queen having great gifts to give — yea these that whoso hath seen her shall not live except he serve her sorrowing with strange pain travail and bloodshedding and bitterer tears and when she bids die he shall surely die and he shall leave all things under the sky and go forth naked under sun and rain and work and wait and watch out all his years — hath she on earth no place of habitation — age to age calling nation answering nation cries out where is she and there is none to say for if she be not in the spirit of men for if in the inward soul she hath no place in vain they cry unto her seeking her face in vain their mouths make much of her for they cry with vain tongues till the heart lives again — o ye that follow and have ye no repentance for on your brows is written a mortal sentence an hieroglyph of sorrow a fiery sign that in your lives ye shall not pause or rest nor have the sure sweet common love nor keep friends and safe days nor joy of life nor sleep — these have we not who have one thing the divine face and clear eyes of faith and fruitful breast — and ye shall die before your thrones be won — yea and the changed world and the liberal sun shall move and shine without us and we lie dead but if she too move on earth and live but if the old world with all the old irons rent laugh and give thanks shall we be not content nay we shall rather live we shall not die life being so little and death so good to give — and these men shall forget you.—yea but we shall be a part of the earth and the ancient sea and heaven-high air august and awful fire and all things good and no man 's heart shall beat but somewhat in it of our blood once shed shall quiver and quicken as now in us the dead blood of men slain and the old same life 's desire plants in their fiery footprints our fresh feet — but ye that might be clothed with all things pleasant ye are foolish that put off the fair soft present that clothe yourselves with the cold future air when mother and father and tender sister and brother and the old live love that was shall be as ye dust and no fruit of loving life shall be — she shall be yet who is more than all these were than sister or wife or father unto us or mother — is this worth life is this to win for wages lo the dead mouths of the awful grey-grown ages the venerable in the past that is their prison in the outer darkness in the unopening grave laugh knowing how many as ye now say have said how many and all are fallen are fallen and dead shall ye dead rise and these dead have not risen —not we but she who is tender and swift to save — are ye not weary and faint not by the way seeing night by night devoured of day by day seeing hour by hour consumed in sleepless fire sleepless and ye too when shall ye too sleep — we are weary in heart and head in hands and feet and surely more than all things sleep were sweet than all things save the inexorable desire which whoso knoweth shall neither faint nor weep — is this so sweet that one were fain to follow is this so sure where all men 's hopes are hollow even this your dream that by much tribulation ye shall make whole flawed hearts and bowed necks straight — nay though our life were blind our death were fruitless not therefore were the whole world 's high hope rootless but man to man nation would turn to nation and the old life live and the old great world be great — pass on then and pass by us and let us be for what light think ye after life to see and if the world fare better will ye know and if man triumph who shall seek you and say — enough of light is this for one life 's span that all men born are mortal but not man and we men bring death lives by night to sow that man may reap and eat and live by day
my youth i hear it mostly in the long volleying echoes of billiards in the pool halls where i spent it all extravagantly believing my delicate touch on a cue would last for years outside the vineyards vanished under rain and the trees held still or seemed to hold their breath when the men i worked with pruning orchards sang their lost songs amapola la paloma jalisco no te rajes—the corny tunes their sons would just as soon forget at recess where they lounged apart in small groups of their own still even when they laughed they laughed in spanish i hated high school then on weekends drove a tractor through the widowed fields it was so boring i memorized poems above the engine ’ s monotone sometimes whole days slipped past without my noticing and birds of all kinds flew in front of me then i learned to tell them apart by their empty squabblings the slightest change in plumage or the inflection of a call and why not admit it i was happy then i believed in no one i had the kind of solitude the world usually allows only to kings criminals who are extinct who disdain this world who rot corrupt shallow as fields i disced i turned up the same gray earth for years still the land made a glum raisin each autumn made that little hell of days— the vines must have seemed like cages to the mexicans who were paid seven cents a tray for the grapes they picked inside the vines it was hot spiders strummed their emptiness black widow daddy longlegs the vine canes whipped our faces none of us cared and the girls i tried to talk to after class sailed by then each night lay enthroned in my bed with nothing on but the jewels of their embarrassment eyes lips dreams no one the sky the road a life like that it seemed to go on forever— reading poems in school then driving a stuttering tractor warm afternoons then billiards on blue october nights the thick stars but mostly now i remember the trees wearing their mysterious yellow sullenness like party dresses and parties i didn ’ t attend and then the first ice hung like spider lattices or the embroideries of great aunt no one and then the first dark entering the trees— and inside the adults with their cocktails before dinner the way they always seemed afraid of something and sat so rigidly although the land was theirs

as i walked up the rue des martyrs with my bag of small perfect waxy potatoes i doffed my imaginary hat to monsieur parmentier well i do have a hat and wore it a lot not so long ago to cover a healing wound on my forehead but this wasn ’ t necessary anymore and anyway the hat wasn ’ t with me now in paris nor was monsieur parmentier though any remains of him lie in a plot in père lachaise ringed by potato plants i would not be intending to cook my potatoes if not for the duplicitous actions of parmentier back in the late years of the 18th century after he ’ d realized that this odd-shaped tuber looted from the incas in peru along with their gold and silver was extremely nutritious and no one would believe him he ’ d come up with a ruse using money given to him by king louis xvi he purchased a plot of impoverished ground outside paris in neuilly-sur-seine and planted it with potatoes when the time to dig them came he built a fence around them and put armed guards outside it these men wore uniforms the color of potatoes they were told to leak the news that they were guarding an extremely precious food then one night they left their post thieves arrived within a couple of hours and stole the entire crop over the next few days the potatoes were sold in the city ’ s markets as the food of kings so my guests wouldn ’ t know they would be eating the food of kings nor would i tell them though i might well concoct a story about the breed of pigs their pork chops had come from and the posh wine that had yielded the wine vinegar i ’ d used in the salad dressing i could try telling them i ’ d climbed over the fence of père lachaise the previous night armed with a phone-torch a troweling spade and a canvas bag and dug the potatoes from monsieur parmentier ’ s plot — only taking the small ones that were right for pommes sautées of course — but i know they wouldn ’ t believe me i was distracted from these smug reveries by my mobile phone ringing i dug it out of my pocket and answered it thinking one advantage of being in france was that nobody rang me the voice at the other end was not one i recognized it said at first quietly “ are you ok ” then in a louder voice “ please tell me you ’ re ok over there ” and that was it when i went to check the number it had been withheld what had i landed myself in i wondered i went home to deal with my 19th-century french meal
i walked along rue du faubourg du temple on the way to belleville and i stopped at a shop selling rat poison to my astonishment and my amusement they had a window full of stuffed rats including four small rats standing round a table playing cards i liked that very much paris was full of weird turnarounds it seemed — poisoning and elevating the rats to art at the same time i nearly went in and asked how much the four rats and the tiny table would cost but i remembered i ’ d be going back to ireland pretty soon and the people at airport security might not see the joke it was not the first time i ’ d seen rat poison on sale here paris seemed to have a problem with rats someone i ’ d met for lunch recently had said she ’ d seen them running around the métro platform when she was coming home once around midnight i remembered a rat had made a dramatic appearance in one of baudelaire ’ s little poems in prose a rich boy had lost interest in his expensive toy because he ’ d seen a poor boy poking a rat in an improvised cage i ’ m pretty sure that wasn ’ t an invention on baudelaire ’ s part — lots of poor parents probably thought of giving their children or at least their sons rats as pets hadn ’ t i had a pet mouse myself the rich boy who ’ d seen the rat certainly was delighted at the idea of having the creature as a pet many years ago a friend of mine who worked as a chef gave me his original copy of larousse gastronomique — an edition first published in the 1920s or 30s in there i think was a recipe called cassoulet de grand souris this was basically rat meat given the coq au vin or boeuf bourguignon treatment i.e cooked in red wine with mushrooms and tiny onions i can ’ t remember which top parisian restaurant introduced the dish onto their menu during the siege of paris in 1870–71 but apparently it proved very popular it made sense too as the siege lasted for more than four months and no meat was getting in while rats were plentiful then as now i seem to recall the menus of the time sometimes also included rat salami and a rat sauce called sauce robert it ’ s no use looking in a current edition of larousse as the book has been cleaned up — all mention of rats have been removed i had some experience of rats when i was a child in donegal i commonly saw water rats swimming in the stream or small river that flowed behind my primary school the house i grew up in had rats under the floorboards i used to love spending time under the stairs and sometimes the rats would come in through a hole in the back i don ’ t remember ever having been afraid of them but i never touched them or wanted them to walk on top of me and i certainly never thought of capturing one and making it my pet my little pink-eyed albino mouse was rodent enough for me and even that was a trial for my mother
costa rica i finally find the witch she is branch- boned old with knowing fingers she says nothing walks me to a tall tree a gourd hanging from a long line of jute she pulls out a phone asks me to type a note to my family i do it but can ’ t see how it can be sent from somewhere so deep she scolds me says that only tourists think the world can be escaped the jungle ’ s green is the wild mind of god the witch puts the phone into the gourd hand-over-hand she raises this cradle to the top of the holy canopy
walking at el pulguero a tarp shines next to the dog track the dog track a bowl similar to the colosseum but with steel poles subdividing the voyeurs and attending bidders tickets yellow and flapping in their hands greyhounds on the billboards ... i walk under the stands bracelets in a jumble under the black- marker-scribbled advertisement brown board it exemplifies the innocent rebuttal to being cultured by my particular country — the country of my birth though not quite my teaching the cuba of the womb of the in-walking-distance- of-the-beach land in my memory with shouts beside our houses at the corner belonging to the distribution agency fruits mangoes milk soy beef when that traveled our way divided and partitioned by an old minibus with a man in an apron and a smudged baby blue shirt i remember soda bottles being carried off up our streets but by who i don ’ t remember too vintage a memory to properly retell orangey glued to the burn of sunset on time that young inside — i as well draw from that very same exclusion a pleasure from this participating memory my childhood was a happy one albeit the pangs existed sharp like a battery violent sorrowful but elastic coming back at night home be it dark inside the house this indictment the personal exclusion goes timid up my skin and neck at the pulguero or not i ’ ll find something to bother about it is that time turbulent and worrisome until later it is just not only this place and so i reap from the crystalline sky the mangled trees the faux marble and jet furniture with gold filigree forming a subtle chinese dragon what i can the gold iron floor lamps the off-brand running shoes — fila but not really always apart from what includes me vaguely includes me is chummy enough falling out of the tether when more incisive probing corners along and so in my cooperation- less demeanor i shuffle further into the flea market never benefitting from the seductive resignation of allowing everything a true potential buying power • the baby marmoset gurgles when belly-rubbed deserted by its mother the video lector tells us the youtube bubble incarnadine in the corner a hibiscus a bee dropping from its flight one dreams it could be okay to keep the little monkey for an alarm clock in the a.m. a gang of marmosets intertwines among the branches the ground heaves an ash coloring i bogey my apprehensions on the little primates flinging bug-eyed i read their spastic jerking as uncohesive with my stock of reality • the stony wheel gurgling in its solar pickling moss underhand the water running its cataracts of limpid murk the wheel has cracks in the stony center • a frittata offered to us by a resident he ’ s a culinary student it was surplus practice and oats on the bread loaves also in the offer he ’ s a kind gentleman toughened by who knows what he ’ s staying here at the shelter and i ’ m too coward to ask about his life like a scouter of fumy billows we all happen upon the hits which we must report to someone and god knows how they ’ ll take it • i listen in on the praxis applied to the nexus in accelerating intimate make-out fondling i feel it with every go at the mouth and lips teeth testing their courtship at submittal effusive biting • the phone shelly an onyx coat warm in the jacket pocket a regulator ’ s annual finish like a yearling passerine flickering on the computer screen

i grew up bent over a chessboard i loved the word endgame all my cousins looked worried it was a small house near a roman graveyard planes and tanks shook its windowpanes a retired professor of astronomy taught me how to play that must have been in 1944. in the set we were using the paint had almost chipped off the black pieces the white king was missing and had to be substituted for i ’ m told but do not believe that that summer i witnessed men hung from telephone poles i remember my mother blindfolding me a lot she had a way of tucking my head suddenly under her overcoat in chess too the professor told me the masters play blindfolded the great ones on several boards at the same time
the poet pursues his beautiful theme the preacher his golden beatitude and i run after a vanishing dream— the glittering will-o ’ -the-wispish gleam of the properly scholarly attitude— the highly desirable the very advisable the hardly acquirable properly scholarly attitude i envy the savage without any clothes who lives in a tropical latitude it ’ s little of general culture he knows but then he escapes the worrisome woes of the properly scholarly attitude— the unceasingly sighed over wept over cried over the futilely died over properly scholarly attitude i work and i work till i nearly am dead and could say what the watchman said—that i could but still with a sigh and a shake of the head “ you don ’ t understand ” it is ruthlessly said “ the properly scholarly attitude— the aye to be sought for wrought for and fought for the ne ’ er to be caught for properly scholarly attitude— ” i really am sometimes tempted to say that it ’ s merely a glittering platitude that people have just fallen into the way when lacking a subject to tell of the sway of the properly scholarly attitude— the easily preachable spread-eagle speechable in practice unreachable properly scholarly attitude
the porter in the pullman car was charming as they sometimes are he scanned my baggage tags “ are you the man who wrote of lady lou ” when i said “ yes ” he made a fuss — oh he was most assiduous and i was pleased to think that he enjoyed my brand of poetry he was forever at my call so when we got to montreal and he had brushed me off i said “ i ’ m glad my poems you have read i feel quite flattered i confess and if you give me your address i ’ ll send you autographed of course one of my little books of verse. ” he smiled — his teeth were white as milk he spoke — his voice was soft as silk i recognized despite his skin the perfect gentleman within then courteously he made reply “ i thank you kindly sir but i with many other cherished tome have all your books of verse at home “ when i was quite a little boy i used to savour them with joy and now my daughter aged three can tell the tale of sam mcgee while tom my son that ’ s only two has heard the yarn of dan mcgrew ... don ’ t think your stuff i ’ m not applaudin ’ — my taste is eliot and auden. ” so as we gravely bade adieu i felt quite snubbed — and so would you and yet i shook him by the hand impressed that he could understand the works of those two tops i mention so far beyond my comprehension — a humble bard of boys and barmen disdained alas by pullman carmen
heads were rolling down the highway in high slat trucks i knew it was time to buy you and found you the last sphere unscarred and undistorted in the store big as my own head it was time too to leave you uncut and full-featured like the grandpa of twenty-five pumpkins in my past khrushchev-cheeked and dwelling on yourself great knee of my childhood i plainly thought you would rot i remembered the fetor of other pumpkins their blue populations coming out of hiding as if at the end of some apocalypse i devoted a day to reading up on minor cucurbits i learned your dozen names in african and came home ready to raise or raze you positive of change but so far—eternity i think i would not like eternity after i had used my senses up as i ’ ve tried with you—fingertips dragging over your world pole to pole till they go dead like explorers nostril cilia detecting your fragrance more delicate than they— and my patience it ’ s christmas it ’ s a new year and i hear of a family who ’ s kept you for four ... you endure like matter manufactured and indeed your stem seems punched into your orange gathers like a button in a mattress shall i give you a room or a shrine and shall i purchase you a mate and family when ours is so inadequate fixed upon your window deathbed as we are centered upon a time and birth new holiday new friends new pumpkins celebrating when all that has failed us has passed away you have not failed
don ’ t hurt the radio for against all solid testimony machines have feelings too brush past it lightly with a fine regard for allowing its molecules to remain 100 intact machines can think like wittgenstein and the radio ’ s a machine thinking softly to itself of the midnight flower as her tawny parts unfold in slow motion the boat rocks on the ocean as her tawny parts unfold the radio does something mental to itself singingly as her tawny parts unfold inside its wires and steal away its heart two minutes after eleven the color dream communicates itself the ink falls on the paper as if magically the scalp falls away a pain is felt deep in the radio i take out my larynx and put it on the blue chair and do my dance for the radio it ’ s my dance in which i kneel in front of the radio and while remaining motionless elsewise force my eyeballs to come as close together as possible while uttering a horrible and foreign word which i can not repeat to you without now removing my larynx and placing it on the blue chair the blue chair isn ’ t here so i can ’ t do that trick at the present time the radio is thinking a few licks of its own pianistic thoughts attuned to tomorrow ’ s grammar beautiful spas of seltzery coition plucked notes like sandpaper attacked by woody woodpecker the radio says edwardian farmers from minnesota march on the mafia armed with millions of radioactive poker chips the radio fears foul play it turns impersonal a piggy bank was smashed a victim was found naked radio how can you tell me this in such a chipper tone your structure of voices is a friend the best kind the kind one can turn on or off whenever one wants to but that is wrong i know for you will intensely to continue and in a deeper way you do hours go by and i watch you as you diligently apply a series of audible frequencies to tiny receptors located inside my cranium resulting in much pleasure for someone who looks like me although he is seated about two inches to my left and the both of us are listening to your every word with a weird misapprehension it ’ s the last of the tenth and harmon killebrew is up with a man aboard he blasts a game-winning home run the 559th of his career but no one cares because the broadcast is studio-monitored for taping to be replayed in 212 years heaven must be like this radio to not care about anything because it ’ s all being taped for replay much later heaven must be like this for as her tawny parts unfold the small lights swim roseate as if of sepals were the tarp made as it is invisibly unrolled and sundown gasps its old ray charles 45 of georgia only through your voice
black reapers with the sound of steel on stones are sharpening scythes i see them place the hones in their hip-pockets as a thing that ’ s done and start their silent swinging one by one black horses drive a mower through the weeds and there a field rat startled squealing bleeds his belly close to ground i see the blade blood-stained continue cutting weeds and shade
there was a roaring in the wind all night the rain came heavily and fell in floods but now the sun is rising calm and bright the birds are singing in the distant woods over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters all things that love the sun are out of doors the sky rejoices in the morning 's birth the grass is bright with rain-drops —on the moors the hare is running races in her mirth and with her feet she from the plashy earth raises a mist that glittering in the sun runs with her all the way wherever she doth run i was a traveller then upon the moor i saw the hare that raced about with joy i heard the woods and distant waters roar or heard them not as happy as a boy the pleasant season did my heart employ my old remembrances went from me wholly and all the ways of men so vain and melancholy but as it sometimes chanceth from the might of joys in minds that can no further go as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low to me that morning did it happen so and fears and fancies thick upon me came dim sadness—and blind thoughts i knew not nor could name i heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky and i bethought me of the playful hare even such a happy child of earth am i even as these blissful creatures do i fare far from the world i walk and from all care but there may come another day to me— solitude pain of heart distress and poverty my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought as if life 's business were a summer mood as if all needful things would come unsought to genial faith still rich in genial good but how can he expect that others should build for him sow for him and at his call love him who for himself will take no heed at all i thought of chatterton the marvellous boy the sleepless soul that perished in his pride of him who walked in glory and in joy following his plough along the mountain-side by our own spirits are we deified we poets in our youth begin in gladness but thereof come in the end despondency and madness now whether it were by peculiar grace a leading from above a something given yet it befell that in this lonely place when i with these untoward thoughts had striven beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven i saw a man before me unawares the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a sea-beast crawled forth that on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself such seemed this man not all alive nor dead nor all asleep—in his extreme old age his body was bent double feet and head coming together in life 's pilgrimage as if some dire constraint of pain or rage of sickness felt by him in times long past a more than human weight upon his frame had cast himself he propped limbs body and pale face upon a long grey staff of shaven wood and still as i drew near with gentle pace upon the margin of that moorish flood motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth all together if it move at all at length himself unsettling he the pond stirred with his staff and fixedly did look upon the muddy water which he conned as if he had been reading in a book and now a stranger 's privilege i took and drawing to his side to him did say '' this morning gives us promise of a glorious day '' a gentle answer did the old man make in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew and him with further words i thus bespake '' what occupation do you there pursue this is a lonesome place for one like you '' ere he replied a flash of mild surprise broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes his words came feebly from a feeble chest but each in solemn order followed each with something of a lofty utterance drest— choice word and measured phrase above the reach of ordinary men a stately speech such as grave livers do in scotland use religious men who give to god and man their dues he told that to these waters he had come to gather leeches being old and poor employment hazardous and wearisome and he had many hardships to endure from pond to pond he roamed from moor to moor housing with god 's good help by choice or chance and in this way he gained an honest maintenance the old man still stood talking by my side but now his voice to me was like a stream scarce heard nor word from word could i divide and the whole body of the man did seem like one whom i had met with in a dream or like a man from some far region sent to give me human strength by apt admonishment my former thoughts returned the fear that kills and hope that is unwilling to be fed cold pain and labour and all fleshly ills and mighty poets in their misery dead —perplexed and longing to be comforted my question eagerly did i renew '' how is it that you live and what is it you do '' he with a smile did then his words repeat and said that gathering leeches far and wide he travelled stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pools where they abide `` once i could meet with them on every side but they have dwindled long by slow decay yet still i persevere and find them where i may '' while he was talking thus the lonely place the old man 's shape and speech—all troubled me in my mind 's eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually wandering about alone and silently while i these thoughts within myself pursued he having made a pause the same discourse renewed and soon with this he other matter blended cheerfully uttered with demeanour kind but stately in the main and when he ended i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind `` god '' said i `` be my help and stay secure i 'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor ''
because he was a butcher and thereby did earn an honest living and did right i would not have you think that reuben bright was any more a brute than you or i for when they told him that his wife must die he stared at them and shook with grief and fright and cried like a great baby half that night and made the women cry to see him cry and after she was dead and he had paid the singers and the sexton and the rest he packed a lot of things that she had made most mournfully away in an old chest of hers and put some chopped-up cedar boughs in with them and tore down the slaughter-house

that year of the cloud when my marriage failed i slept in a chair by the flagstone hearth fighting my sleep and one night saw a hessian soldier stand at attention there in full regalia till his head broke into flames my only other callers were the fbi sent to investigate me as a russian spy by patriotic neighbors on the river road and flying squirrels parachuting from the elms who squeaked in rodent heat between the walls and upstairs rumbled at their nutty games i never dared open the attic door even my nervous leghorns joined the act indulging their taste for chicken from behind a glazed look swam into the survivors ’ eyes they caught a sort of dancing-sickness a variation of the blind staggers that hunched their narrow backs and struck a stiffened wing akimbo as round and round the poultry yard they flapped and dropped and flapped again the county agent shook his head not one of them was spared the cyanide that year of the cloud when my marriage failed i paced up and down the bottom-fields tamping the mud-puddled nurslings in with a sharp blow of the heel timed to the chop-chop of the hoe red pine and white larch balsam fir one stride apart two hundred to the row until i heard from rossiter ’ s woods the downward spiral of a veery ’ s song unwinding on the eve of war lord lord who has lived so long count it ten thousand trees ago five houses and ten thousand trees since the swallows exploded from bowman tower over the place where the hermit sang while i held a fantail of squirming roots that kissed the palm of my dirty hand as if in reply to a bird the stranger who hammers no trespass signs to the staghorn sumac along the road must think he owns this property i park my car below the curve and climbing over the tumbled stones where the wild foxgrape perseveres i walk into the woods i made my dark and resinous blistered land through the deep litter of the years
it ’ s a kitchen its curtains fill with a morning light so bright you can ’ t see beyond its windows into the afternoon a kitchen falling through time with its things in their places the dishes jingling up in the cupboard the bucket of drinking water rippled as if a truck had just gone past but that truck was thirty years no one ’ s at home in this room its counter is wiped and the dishrag hangs from its nail a dry leaf in housedresses of mist blue aprons of rain my grandmother moved through this life like a ghost and when she had finished her years she put them all back in their places and wiped out the sink turning her back on the rest of us forever
coldly sadly descends the autumn-evening the field strewn with its dank yellow drifts of wither 'd leaves and the elms fade into dimness apace silent —hardly a shout from a few boys late at their play the lights come out in the street in the school-room windows —but cold solemn unlighted austere through the gathering darkness arise the chapel-walls in whose bound thou my father art laid there thou dost lie in the gloom of the autumn evening but ah that word gloom to my mind brings thee back in the light of thy radiant vigour again in the gloom of november we pass'd days not dark at thy side seasons impair 'd not the ray of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear such thou wast and i stand in the autumn evening and think of bygone autumns with thee fifteen years have gone round since thou arosest to tread in the summer-morning the road of death at a call unforeseen sudden for fifteen years we who till then in thy shade rested as under the boughs of a mighty oak have endured sunshine and rain as we might bare unshaded alone lacking the shelter of thee o strong soul by what shore tarriest thou now for that force surely has not been left vain somewhere surely afar in the sounding labour-house vast of being is practised that strength zealous beneficent firm yes in some far-shining sphere conscious or not of the past still thou performest the word of the spirit in whom thou dost live— prompt unwearied as here still thou upraisest with zeal the humble good from the ground sternly repressest the bad still like a trumpet dost rouse those who with half-open eyes tread the border-land dim 'twixt vice and virtue reviv'st succourest —this was thy work this was thy life upon earth what is the course of the life of mortal men on the earth — most men eddy about here and there—eat and drink chatter and love and hate gather and squander are raised aloft are hurl 'd in the dust striving blindly achieving nothing and then they die— perish —and no one asks who or what they have been more than he asks what waves in the moonlit solitudes mild of the midmost ocean have swell 'd foam 'd for a moment and gone and there are some whom a thirst ardent unquenchable fires not with the crowd to be spent not without aim to go round in an eddy of purposeless dust effort unmeaning and vain ah yes some of us strive not without action to die fruitless but something to snatch from dull oblivion nor all glut the devouring grave we we have chosen our path— path to a clear-purposed goal path of advance —but it leads a long steep journey through sunk gorges o'er mountains in snow cheerful with friends we set forth— then on the height comes the storm thunder crashes from rock to rock the cataracts reply lightnings dazzle our eyes roaring torrents have breach'd the track the stream-bed descends in the place where the wayfarer once planted his footstep—the spray boils o'er its borders aloft the unseen snow-beds dislodge their hanging ruin alas havoc is made in our train friends who set forth at our side falter are lost in the storm we we only are left with frowning foreheads with lips sternly compress 'd we strain on on—and at nightfall at last come to the end of our way to the lonely inn 'mid the rocks where the gaunt and taciturn host stands on the threshold the wind shaking his thin white hairs— holds his lantern to scan our storm-beat figures and asks whom in our party we bring whom we have left in the snow sadly we answer we bring only ourselves we lost sight of the rest in the storm hardly ourselves we fought through stripp 'd without friends as we are friends companions and train the avalanche swept from our side but thou woulds't not alone be saved my father alone conquer and come to thy goal leaving the rest in the wild we were weary and we fearful and we in our march fain to drop down and to die still thou turnedst and still beckonedst the trembler and still gavest the weary thy hand if in the paths of the world stones might have wounded thy feet toil or dejection have tried thy spirit of that we saw nothing—to us thou wage still cheerful and helpful and firm therefore to thee it was given many to save with thyself and at the end of thy day o faithful shepherd to come bringing thy sheep in thy hand and through thee i believe in the noble and great who are gone pure souls honour 'd and blest by former ages who else— such so soulless so poor is the race of men whom i see— seem 'd but a dream of the heart seem 'd but a cry of desire yes i believe that there lived others like thee in the past not like the men of the crowd who all round me to-day bluster or cringe and make life hideous and arid and vile but souls temper 'd with fire fervent heroic and good helpers and friends of mankind servants of god —or sons shall i not call you because not as servants ye knew your father 's innermost mind his who unwillingly sees one of his little ones lost— yours is the praise if mankind hath not as yet in its march fainted and fallen and died see in the rocks of the world marches the host of mankind a feeble wavering line where are they tending —a god marshall 'd them gave them their goal ah but the way is so long years they have been in the wild sore thirst plagues them the rocks rising all round overawe factions divide them their host threatens to break to dissolve —ah keep keep them combined else of the myriads who fill that army not one shall arrive sole they shall stray in the rocks stagger for ever in vain die one by one in the waste then in such hour of need of your fainting dispirited race ye like angels appear radiant with ardour divine beacons of hope ye appear languor is not in your heart weakness is not in your word weariness not on your brow ye alight in our van at your voice panic despair flee away ye move through the ranks recall the stragglers refresh the outworn praise re-inspire the brave order courage return eyes rekindling and prayers follow your steps as ye go ye fill up the gaps in our files strengthen the wavering line stablish continue our march on to the bound of the waste on to the city of god
it will be an island on strings well out to sea and austere bobbing as if at anchor green with enormous fir trees formal as telephone poles we will arrive there slowly hand over hand without oars last out you will snip the fragile umbilicus white as a beansprout that sewed us into our diaries we will be two bleached hermits at home in our patches and tears we will butter the sun with our wisdom our days will be grapes on a trellis perfectly oval and furred at night we will set our poems adrift in ginger ale bottles each with a clamshell rudder each with a piggyback spider waving them off by dogstar and nothing will come from the mainland to tell us who cares who cares and nothing will come of our lovelock except as our two hearts go soft and black as avocado pears
often visitors there saddened by lack of trees go out to a promontory then backed by the banded sunset the trail of the conquistadores the father puts on the camera the leather albatross and has the children imitate saguaros one at a time they stand there smiling fingers up like the tines of a fork while the stately saguaro goes on being entered by wrens diseases and sunlight the mother sits on a rock arms folded across her breasts to her the cactus looks scared its needles like hair in cartoons with its arms in preacher or waltz position it gives the impression of great effort in every direction like the mother thousands of these gray-green cacti cross the valley nature repeating itself children repeating nature father repeating children and mother watching later the children think the cactus was moral had something to teach them some survival technique or just regular beauty but what else could it do the only protection against death was to love solitude

go for they call you shepherd from the hill go shepherd and untie the wattled cotes no longer leave thy wistful flock unfed nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats nor the cropp 'd herbage shoot another head but when the fields are still and the tired men and dogs all gone to rest and only the white sheep are sometimes seen cross and recross the strips of moon-blanch 'd green come shepherd and again begin the quest here where the reaper was at work of late— in this high field 's dark corner where he leaves his coat his basket and his earthen cruse and in the sun all morning binds the sheaves then here at noon comes back his stores to use— here will i sit and wait while to my ear from uplands far away the bleating of the folded flocks is borne with distant cries of reapers in the corn— all the live murmur of a summer 's day screen 'd is this nook o'er the high half-reap 'd field and here till sun-down shepherd will i be through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep and round green roots and yellowing stalks i see pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep and air-swept lindens yield their scent and rustle down their perfumed showers of bloom on the bent grass where i am laid and bower me from the august sun with shade and the eye travels down to oxford 's towers and near me on the grass lies glanvil 's book— come let me read the oft-read tale again the story of the oxford scholar poor of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain who tired of knocking at preferment 's door one summer-morn forsook his friends and went to learn the gipsy-lore and roam 'd the world with that wild brotherhood and came as most men deem 'd to little good but came to oxford and his friends no more but once years after in the country-lanes two scholars whom at college erst he knew met him and of his way of life enquired whereat he answer 'd that the gipsy-crew his mates had arts to rule as they desired the workings of men 's brains and they can bind them to what thoughts they will `` and i '' he said `` the secret of their art when fully learn 'd will to the world impart but it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill '' this said he left them and return 'd no more.— but rumours hung about the country-side that the lost scholar long was seen to stray seen by rare glimpses pensive and tongue-tied in hat of antique shape and cloak of grey the same the gipsies wore shepherds had met him on the hurst in spring at some lone alehouse in the berkshire moors on the warm ingle-bench the smock-frock 'd boors had found him seated at their entering but 'mid their drink and clatter he would fly and i myself seem half to know thy looks and put the shepherds wanderer on thy trace and boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks i ask if thou hast pass 'd their quiet place or in my boat i lie moor 'd to the cool bank in the summer-heats 'mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills and watch the warm green-muffled cumner hills and wonder if thou haunt'st their shy retreats for most i know thou lov'st retired ground thee at the ferry oxford riders blithe returning home on summer-nights have met crossing the stripling thames at bab-lock-hithe trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet as the punt 's rope chops round and leaning backward in a pensive dream and fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers pluck 'd in shy fields and distant wychwood bowers and thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream and then they land and thou art seen no more — maidens who from the distant hamlets come to dance around the fyfield elm in may oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam or cross a stile into the public way oft thou hast given them store of flowers—the frail-leaf 'd white anemony dark bluebells drench 'd with dews of summer eves and purple orchises with spotted leaves— but none hath words she can report of thee and above godstow bridge when hay-time 's here in june and many a scythe in sunshine flames men who through those wide fields of breezy grass where black-wing 'd swallows haunt the glittering thames to bathe in the abandon 'd lasher pass have often pass 'd thee near sitting upon the river bank o'ergrown mark 'd thine outlandish garb thy figure spare thy dark vague eyes and soft abstracted air— but when they came from bathing thou wast gone at some lone homestead in the cumner hills where at her open door the housewife darns thou hast been seen or hanging on a gate to watch the threshers in the mossy barns children who early range these slopes and late for cresses from the rills have known thee eyeing all an april-day the springing pasture and the feeding kine and mark 'd thee when the stars come out and shine through the long dewy grass move slow away in autumn on the skirts of bagley wood— where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way pitch their smoked tents and every bush you see with scarlet patches tagg 'd and shreds of grey above the forest-ground called thessaly— the blackbird picking food sees thee nor stops his meal nor fears at all so often has he known thee past him stray rapt twirling in thy hand a wither 'd spray and waiting for the spark from heaven to fall and once in winter on the causeway chill where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go have i not pass 'd thee on the wooden bridge wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow thy face tow'rd hinksey and its wintry ridge and thou has climb 'd the hill and gain 'd the white brow of the cumner range turn 'd once to watch while thick the snowflakes fall the line of festal light in christ-church hall— then sought thy straw in some sequester 'd grange but what—i dream two hundred years are flown since first thy story ran through oxford halls and the grave glanvil did the tale inscribe that thou wert wander 'd from the studious walls to learn strange arts and join a gipsy-tribe and thou from earth art gone long since and in some quiet churchyard laid— some country-nook where o'er thy unknown grave tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave under a dark red-fruited yew-tree 's shade —no no thou hast not felt the lapse of hours for what wears out the life of mortal men 't is that from change to change their being rolls 'tis that repeated shocks again again exhaust the energy of strongest souls and numb the elastic powers till having used our nerves with bliss and teen and tired upon a thousand schemes our wit to the just-pausing genius we remit our worn-out life and are—what we have been thou hast not lived why should'st thou perish so thou hadst one aim one business one desire else wert thou long since number 'd with the dead else hadst thou spent like other men thy fire the generations of thy peers are fled and we ourselves shall go but thou possessest an immortal lot and we imagine thee exempt from age and living as thou liv'st on glanvil 's page because thou hadst—what we alas have not for early didst thou leave the world with powers fresh undiverted to the world without firm to their mark not spent on other things free from the sick fatigue the languid doubt which much to have tried in much been baffled brings o life unlike to ours who fluctuate idly without term or scope of whom each strives nor knows for what he strives and each half lives a hundred different lives who wait like thee but not like thee in hope thou waitest for the spark from heaven and we light half-believers of our casual creeds who never deeply felt nor clearly will 'd whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds whose vague resolves never have been fulfill 'd for whom each year we see breeds new beginnings disappointments new who hesitate and falter life away and lose to-morrow the ground won to-day— ah do not we wanderer await it too yes we await it —but it still delays and then we suffer and amongst us one who most has suffer 'd takes dejectedly his seat upon the intellectual throne and all his store of sad experience he lays bare of wretched days tells us his misery 's birth and growth and signs and how the dying spark of hope was fed and how the breast was soothed and how the head and all his hourly varied anodynes this for our wisest and we others pine and wish the long unhappy dream would end and waive all claim to bliss and try to bear with close-lipp 'd patience for our only friend sad patience too near neighbour to despair— but none has hope like thine thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray roaming the country-side a truant boy nursing thy project in unclouded joy and every doubt long blown by time away o born in days when wits were fresh and clear and life ran gaily as the sparkling thames before this strange disease of modern life with its sick hurry its divided aims its heads o'ertax 'd its palsied hearts was rife— fly hence our contact fear still fly plunge deeper in the bowering wood averse as dido did with gesture stern from her false friend 's approach in hades turn wave us away and keep thy solitude still nursing the unconquerable hope still clutching the inviolable shade with a free onward impulse brushing through by night the silver 'd branches of the glade— far on the forest-skirts where none pursue on some mild pastoral slope emerge and resting on the moonlit pales freshen thy flowers as in former years with dew or listen with enchanted ears from the dark tingles to the nightingales but fly our paths our feverish contact fly for strong the infection of our mental strife which though it gives no bliss yet spoils for rest and we should win thee from thy own fair life like us distracted and like us unblest soon soon thy cheer would die thy hopes grow timorous and unfix 'd thy powers and thy clear aims be cross and shifting made and then thy glad perennial youth would fade fade and grow old at last and die like ours then fly our greetings fly our speech and smiles —as some grave tyrian trader from the sea descried at sunrise an emerging prow lifting the cool-hair 'd creepers stealthily the fringes of a southward-facing brow among the ægæan isles and saw the merry grecian coaster come freighted with amber grapes and chian wine green bursting figs and tunnies steep 'd in brine— and knew the intruders on his ancient home the young light-hearted masters of the waves— and snatch 'd his rudder and shook out more sail and day and night held on indignantly o'er the blue midland waters with the gale betwixt the syrtes and soft sicily to where the atlantic raves outside the western straits and unbent sails there where down cloudy cliffs through sheets of foam shy traffickers the dark iberians come and on the beach undid his corded bales
then it was the future though what ’ s arrived isn ’ t what we had in mind all chrome and cybernetics when we set up exhibits in the cafeteria for the judges to review what we ’ d made of our hypotheses the class skeptic he later refused to sign anyone ’ s yearbook calling it a sentimental degradation of language chloroformed mice weighing the bodies before and after to catch the weight of the soul wanting to prove the invisible real as a bagful of nails a girl who knew it all made cookies from euglena a one-celled compromise between animal and plant she had cultured in a flask we ’ re smart enough she concluded to survive our mistakes showing photos of farmland poisoned gouged eroded no one believed he really had built it when a kid no one knew showed up with an atom smasher confirming that the tiniest particles could be changed into something even harder to break and one whose mother had cancer hard to admit now it was me distilled the tar of cigarettes to paint it on the backs of shaven mice she wanted to know what it took a little vial of sure malignancy to prove a daily intake smaller than a single aspirin could finish something as large as a life i thought of this because today the dusky seaside sparrow became extinct it may never be as famous as the pterodactyl or the dodo but the last one died today a resident of walt disney world where now its tissue samples lie frozen in case someday we learn to clone one from a few cells like those instant dinosaurs that come in a gelatin capsule—just add water and they inflate one other thing this brings to mind the euglena girl won first prize both for science and i think in retrospect for hope

when first i walked here i hobbled along ties set too close together for a boy to step easily on each i thought my stride one day would reach every other and from then on i would walk in time with the way toward that lobachevskian haze up ahead where the two rails meet here we put down our pennies dark on shined steel they trembled fell still then the locomotive out of attleboro rattling its berserk wheel-rods into perfect circles brightened them into wafers the way a fork mashes into view the inner light of a carrot in a stew in this late march sunshine crossing the trees at the angle of a bow when it effleurages out of the chanterelle the c three octaves above middle c the vertical birthwood remembers its ascent lines shrunken by half exactly back down each tree on its fallen summer back then these rocks often asked blood offerings—but this one once asked bone the time billy wallace tripped and broke out his front teeth fitted with gold replicas he asked speaking more brightly “ what good are golden teeth given what we ’ ve got to eat ” nebuchadnezzar spent seven years down on all fours eating vetch and alfalfa ruminating the mouth-feel of “ bloom ” and “ wither ” until he was whole if you held a grass blade between both thumbs and blew hard you could blurt a shriek out of it—like that beseeching leaves oaks didn ’ t drop last winter just now scratch on a breeze maybe billy lured by bones ’ memory comes back sometimes too to the seekonk woods to stand in the past and just look at it here he might kneel studying this clump of grass as a god might inspect the strands of a human sneeze that percusses through or he might stray into the now untrafficked whistling-lanes of the mourning doves who used to call and call into the future and give a start as though this very minute by awful coincidence they reach it and at last traipse off down the tracks with arrhythmic gait as wanderers must do once they realize the over-the-unknown route too ends up where time wants on this spot i skinned the muskrat the musk breezed away i buried the rat of the fur i made a hat which as soon as put on began to rot off causing my scalp to crawl in circles of course keeping to the skull one day could this scrap of damp skin crawl all the way off and the whole organism follow to do what effuse with musk or rot with rat when a quarter- turn after the sun the half-moon too goes down and we find ourselves in the night 's night then somewhere hereabouts in the dark must be death knowledge of it beforehand is surely among existence ’ s most spectacular feats—and yet right here on this ordinary afternoon in these woods with a name meaning “ black goose ” in wampanoag or in modern seekonkese “ slob blowing fat nose ” this unlikely event happens—a creature walking the tracks knows it will come then too long to touch every tie his stride is now just too short to reach every other and so he is to be still the wanderer the hirtle of too much replaced by the common limp of too little but he almost got there almost stepped in consonance with the liturgical sleeping gods ’ snores you can hear humming up from former times inside the ties he almost set foot in that border zone where what follows blows back shimmering everything making walking like sleepwalking railroad tracks a country lane on a spring morning on which a man limping but blissful makes his way homeward his lips suppled by kissing to bunch up like that blowing these short strands of hollowed-out air haunted by future into a tune on the tracks i think i ’ m about to be shocked awake as i was in childhood when i battered myself back to my senses against a closed door or woke up hanging out of an upstairs window somnambulism was my attempt to slip under cover of nightmare across no father ’ s land and embrace a phantasm if only i had found a way to enter his hard time served at labor by day by night in solitary and put my arms around him in reality i might not now be remaking him in memory still anti-alchemizing bass kettle ’ s golden reverberations back down to hair flesh blood bone the base metals i want to crawl face down in the fields and graze on the wild strawberries my clothes stained pink even for seven years if i must if they exist i want to lie out on my back under the thousand stars and think my way up among them through them and a little distance past them and attain a moment of absolute ignorance if i can if human mentality lets us i have always intended to live forever but not until now to live now the moment i have done one or the other i here swear no one will have to drag me i ’ ll come but never will i agree to burn my words the poplar logs creosoted asleep under the tracks have stopped snoring maybe they ’ ve already waked up the bow saws at g. an oak leaf rattles on its tree the rails may never meet o fellow euclideans for you for me so what if we groan that ’ s our noise laughter is our stuttering in a language we can ’ t speak yet behind the world made of wishes goes dark ahead if not now then never shines what is

others abide our question thou art free we ask and ask—thou smilest and art still out-topping knowledge for the loftiest hill who to the stars uncrowns his majesty planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place spares but the cloudy border of his base to the foil 'd searching of mortality and thou who didst the stars and sunbeams know self-school 'd self-scann 'd self-honour 'd self-secure didst tread on earth unguess 'd at.—better so all pains the immortal spirit must endure all weakness which impairs all griefs which bow find their sole speech in that victorious brow
i like it quiet like this alton i like to think i love the way spring light falls easy soft this morning i was driving the cruiser savoring gold pollen everywhere out in the south of the county real nice seeing forsythia and daffodils ditch irises and a few cherokee roses opening white it was a blue day and i had a tampa jewel just counting cows seeing an april breeze in the catkins and new leaves the radio off i know that ’ s hardly right but curse any citizen who ’ d grudge me an hour ’ s peace then i started seeing this marksmanship in the caution signs the yellow diamonds that warn of deer or curves ahead a steep grade—there ’ s one of those four circles and a jagged hole likely a thirty-eight slug smack in the center neater than willard cleaves meat at the joint a dozen and more i got mad because i get paid to protect what the county commission declares holy— the park with its petting zoo the rebel sentry on the square and all the highway signs— and here ’ s all indications that some felon has no respect some felon who can shoot i admit my feelings were mixed that right indignation at the broken law but envy of his eye for centers mind you i saw nary a rip on the fringes or a near miss bull ’ s-eyes every sign i saw a fool is what i feel you understand cause i motored over to pig burton ’ s store near the bottle and asked him—he was stacking feed sacks on robert ring ’ s vehicle— who the hell was the target king of beat three pig always has his hands in every pie he ’ d know if some individual had been hauling off all the turkey shoot prizes i know i should know too but a sheriff ’ s got beaucoup chores to do mostly idiot paperwork i ’ ve lost touch since the last bond vote hired me four new deputies all dirt-dumb well old pig has that laugh he can ’ t hold back and he points his finger pistol-like at robert who ’ s got a shamed look on his face “ pow ” he says at me or bob looking back and forth just “ pow. ” seems bob ’ s boy earl the one that ain ’ t got the sense of a chicken under that cowlick red as a rooster comb is known to have sneaked bob ’ s colt a week before and shot every yellow sign he could till his pa ran him down and whacked him good then locked him in the fall-down curing shed overnight—he ’ s a hard man but he loves that boy i remember once ... but how the hell can any half-wit you wouldn ’ t trust to milk hit the bull by the eye first time he ever gets loose with a handgun “ it ’ s easy ” says bob less shamed than afraid now he ’ ll have to pay for fresh metal—his people have always been tight—but he ’ s showing a grin i don ’ t like “ real easy he just cuts loose from the hip five short feet back sometimes maybe six and comes back later to paint the target circles wheresomever his bullet hits he aims that paintbrush right smart. ” blessed if i don ’ t feel the fool for being full dumbstruck at a trick earl ’ s not bright enough to see as a joke but i didn ’ t write it up nor charge a soul just ground my cigar in the dirt and helped myself to a dr. pepper made believe it didn ’ t mean a thing but all day i ’ ve been riding listening to crime reports on state radio— robbery at the mall attempted rape maybe wrecks on the bypass and a set fire in brill ’ s deer woods it gets to be too much i shouldn ’ t even take the time to sit here watching this dark space where folks have been dancing all evening hearing the quiet after all those raucous songs but alton don ’ t you see the feeble boy ’ s right or half right at least it all comes to the same whether you get what you want in the end or want what you get the law works that way each law makes more crime but it ’ s not my job to say warm up my cup just one last time i ’ ve got to circle ampex once more before i turn it home god this dark feels right no matter what flowers out there shed spring light the dark is what hits me as holy i ’ m calling it a day catch you later night
there were bees about from the start i thought the day was apt to hurt there is a high hill of sand behind the sea and the kids were dropping from the top of it like schools of fish over falls cracking skulls on skulls i knew the holiday was hot i saw the august sun teeming in the bodies logged along the beach and felt the yearning in the brightly covered parts turning each to each for lunch i bit the olive meat a yellow jacket stung me on the tongue i knelt to spoon and suck the healing sea ... a little girl was digging up canals with her toes her arm hanging in a cast as white as the belly of a dead fish whose dead eye looked at her with me as she opened her grotesque system to the sea ... i walked away now quietly i heard a child moaning from a low mound of sand abandoned by his friend the child was tricked trapped upon his knees in a shallow pit the older ones will say you can get out i dug him up his legs would not unbend i lifted him and held him in my arms as he wept oh i was gnarled as a witch or warlock by his naked weight was slowed in the sand to a thief ’ s gait when his strength flowed he ran and i rested by the sea ... a girl was there i saw her drop her hair let it fall from the doffed cap to her breasts tanned and swollen over wine red woolen a boy his body blackened by the sun rose out of the sand stripping down his limbs with graceful hands he took his gear and walked toward the girl in the brown hair and wine and then past me he brushed her with the soft brilliant monster he lugged into the sea ... by this tide i raised a small cairn of stone light and smooth and clean and cast the shadow of a stick in a perfect line along the sand my own shadow followed then until i felt the cold swirling at the groin
—for frank espada the beer company did not hire blacks or puerto ricans so my father joined the picket line at the schaefer beer pavilion new york world ’ s fair amid the crowds glaring with canine hostility but the cops brandished nightsticks and handcuffs to protect the beer and my father disappeared in 1964 i had never tasted beer and no one told me about the picket signs torn in two by the cops of brewery i knew what dead was dead was a cat overrun with parasites and dumped in the hallway incinerator i knew my father was dead i went mute and filmy-eyed the slow boy who did not hear the question in school i sat studying his framed photograph like a mirror my darker face days later he appeared in the doorway grinning with his gilded tooth not dead though i would come to learn that sometimes puerto ricans die in jail with bruises no one can explain swelling their eyes shut i would learn too that “ boycott ” is not a boy ’ s haircut that i could sketch a picket line on the blank side of a leaflet that day my father returned from the netherworld easily as riding the elevator to apartment 14-f and the brewery cops could only watch in drunken disappointment i searched my father ’ s hands for a sign of the miracle
—brook and road were fellow-travellers in this gloomy pass and with them did we journey several hours at a slow step the immeasurable height of woods decaying never to be decayed the stationary blasts of waterfalls and in the narrow rent at every turn winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn the torrents shooting from the clear blue sky the rocks that muttered close upon our ears black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside as if a voice were in them the sick sight and giddy prospect of the raving stream the unfettered clouds and region of the heavens tumult and peace the darkness and the light— were all like workings of one mind the features of the same face blossoms upon one tree characters of the great apocalypse the types and symbols of eternity of first and last and midst and without end

it is important to remember that you will die lifting the fork with the sheep 's brain lovingly speared on it to the mouth the little piece smooth on the one side as a baby mouse pickled in wine on the other blood- plush and intestinal atop its bed of lentils the lentils were once picked over for stones in the fields of india perhaps the sun shining into tractor blades slow moving as the swimmer ’ s arms that pierce then rise then pierce again the cold water of this river outside your window called the heart or the breast even but meaning something more than this beyond the crudeness of flesh though what is crude about flesh anyway watching yourself every day lose another bit of luster it is wrong to say one kind of beauty replaces another isn ’ t it your heart along with its breast muscles that has started to weaken solace isn ’ t possible for every loss or why else should we clutch stroke grasp love the little powers we once were born with perhaps the worst thing in the world would be to live forever otherwise what would be the point of memory without which we would have nothing to hurt or placate ourselves with later look it is only getting worse from here on out thank god otherwise the sun on this filthy river could never be as boring or as poignant the sheep ’ s brain trembling on the fork wouldn ’ t seem once stung by the tang of grass by the call of some body distant and beloved to it still singing through the milk the fork would be only a fork and not the cool heft of it between your fingers the scratch of lemon in the lentils onions parsley slick with blood food that even as you lift it to your mouth you never thought you ’ d eat and do
1 “ naked woman surrounded by police ” that ’ s one way to start the poem but would she mean anything devoid of her context in this case a lushly late-august deciduous forest some maple mostly oak she carries no prop—for example no bike chain which the cops could be sawing from the tree trunk that she ’ s wedded to her body but let ’ s start with her pure and untranslated as the famous cartoon of the door is a mystery until we post the word ladies at a point that would be four feet up from the ground if this door were not drawn two inches tall—it ’ s us you see who make believe it corresponds to a “ true-life ” human door does it help if i say the naked woman is “ really ” my true- life friend she of the tangled dago surname we don ’ t need to get into here and if i say next that she has been swimming—in lake tiorati— 2. you can see how straightaway the tangling subdivides into a where the hell is lake tiorati and b why naked —to the last let me answer that it ’ s 1978 and she is twenty at college she ’ s been reading simone de beauvoir and learning words like patriarchy and oppression and these have been mixmastered into her thinking even about swimsuits—i.e. that not to wear one is to rip the sign off the door and stomp it underfoot when she lies on a rock the last thing she expects is the tingling she feels now against her wrist from a guy peeing brazenly at her perimeter this is an impasse whose bud she thought she had nipped by aggravating her muscles into interlaced mounds so her body resembles a relief map of the appalachians in whose northernmost range this story unfolds hence the much-delayed answer to item a above 3 “ naked woman dadadadada police ” not a story but words at the end of a chain whose first link is her realizing that the puerto rican kids across the lake splashing and whooping are not having fun— though this is the sign that she ’ d stuck on their door no there ’ s another word for the kid slapping his palms on the water drowning even the urinater abruptly stops his stream and stumbles back from her ashamed and because she ’ s the one with the lifeguard build and because all the guys are much too drunk without even thinking she finds herself paddling toward the spot these kids are now screaming julio at where she draws a mental x upon the water of course it is a fantasy the correspondence that would make a drawing equal life and so you understand how amazing it is when she dives to the bottom and her hand happens on the child 4. perhaps what she expected was for the men on shore to pay her no mind as in manet ’ s déjeuner the naked woman sits among them yet she is a ghost but the kids keep yelling julio even after she ’ s hauled the wet one out the one she points to julio okay no they shriek julio otro words she knows just enough spanish to know mean there ’ s another julio in the lake whom she can not save despite her next round of diving which lasts until the cops come hiking down the trail in their cop shoes then she comes ashore and stands shivering among them telling the story calmly enough until she ends it with for christ ’ s sake can ’ t anyone give her a t-shirt they ’ re staring as if somehow she ’ s what ’ s to blame seeing a naked woman not the miracle which is of course the living boy that with these words—julio otro — we manage to make sense to anyone at all

“ speak speak thou fearful guest who with thy hollow breast still in rude armor drest comest to daunt me wrapt not in eastern balms but with thy fleshless palms stretched as if asking alms why dost thou haunt me ” then from those cavernous eyes pale flashes seemed to rise as when the northern skies gleam in december and like the water ’ s flow under december ’ s snow came a dull voice of woe from the heart ’ s chamber “ i was a viking old my deeds though manifold no skald in song has told no saga taught thee take heed that in thy verse thou dost the tale rehearse else dread a dead man ’ s curse for this i sought thee “ far in the northern land by the wild baltic ’ s strand i with my childish hand tamed the gerfalcon and with my skates fast-bound skimmed the half-frozen sound that the poor whimpering hound trembled to walk on “ oft to his frozen lair tracked i the grisly bear while from my path the hare fled like a shadow oft through the forest dark followed the were-wolf ’ s bark until the soaring lark sang from the meadow “ but when i older grew joining a corsair ’ s crew o ’ er the dark sea i flew with the marauders wild was the life we led many the souls that sped many the hearts that bled by our stern orders “ many a wassail-bout wore the long winter out often our midnight shout set the cocks crowing as we the berserk ’ s tale measured in cups of ale draining the oaken pail filled to o ’ erflowing “ once as i told in glee tales of the stormy sea soft eyes did gaze on me burning yet tender and as the white stars shine on the dark norway pine on that dark heart of mine fell their soft splendor “ i wooed the blue-eyed maid yielding yet half afraid and in the forest ’ s shade our vows were plighted under its loosened vest fluttered her little breast like birds within their nest by the hawk frighted “ bright in her father ’ s hall shields gleamed upon the wall loud sang the minstrels all chanting his glory when of old hildebrand i asked his daughter ’ s hand mute did the minstrels stand to hear my story “ while the brown ale he quaffed loud then the champion laughed and as the wind-gusts waft the sea-foam brightly so the loud laugh of scorn out of those lips unshorn from the deep drinking-horn blew the foam lightly “ she was a prince ’ s child i but a viking wild and though she blushed and smiled i was discarded should not the dove so white follow the sea-mew ’ s flight why did they leave that night her nest unguarded “ scarce had i put to sea bearing the maid with me fairest of all was she among the norsemen when on the white sea-strand waving his armed hand saw we old hildebrand with twenty horsemen “ then launched they to the blast bent like a reed each mast yet we were gaining fast when the wind failed us and with a sudden flaw came round the gusty skaw so that our foe we saw laugh as he hailed us “ and as to catch the gale round veered the flapping sail ‘ death ’ was the helmsman ’ s hail ‘ death without quarter ’ mid-ships with iron keel struck we her ribs of steel down her black hulk did reel through the black water “ as with his wings aslant sails the fierce cormorant seeking some rocky haunt with his prey laden — so toward the open main beating to sea again through the wild hurricane bore i the maiden “ three weeks we westward bore and when the storm was o ’ er cloud-like we saw the shore stretching to leeward there for my lady ’ s bower built i the lofty tower which to this very hour stands looking seaward “ there lived we many years time dried the maiden ’ s tears she had forgot her fears she was a mother death closed her mild blue eyes under that tower she lies ne ’ er shall the sun arise on such another “ still grew my bosom then still as a stagnant fen hateful to me were men the sunlight hateful in the vast forest here clad in my warlike gear fell i upon my spear oh death was grateful “ thus seamed with many scars bursting these prison bars up to its native stars my soul ascended there from the flowing bowl deep drinks the warrior ’ s soul skoal to the northland skoal ” thus the tale ended
we can not push ourselves away from this quiet even in our sprees of inattention the departing passengers stubbing out their smokes arrivees in tears lots of cellophane the rumpus over parking wind scrapes leaves across the road first flashes of snow it is dark then it ’ s really dark forgive me for not writing for so long i ’ ve been right beside you one of the vaguer divinities blocking your way with its need to confess all its botched attempts at love what started the whole mess i love this place its absurd use of balustrade the chairs that dig into the spine motorcyclists propping their drunk girlfriends in the sun men playing timed chess with themselves the guarantees and warnings that entice us to the brink of what they warn about but we can do no more than pass through these rooms and their sudden chills where once a plea was entered almost unintentionally that seemed at last to reveal ourselves to ourselves immaculate bereft deserving to be found

i. did he think that disguise would fool me gathering about his balding head those filthy rags poor-mouthing his way beside my fire then gazing into the looking glass of my bride ’ s-mind to summon up the legend i ’ d seen last at the ashwood threshold twenty years ago the husband who ’ d upped and sailed away on a black oar-swept ship of war to a place he called i call destroy “ your son will vouch for me ” he claimed “ i saw your king on foreign soil he wore a wine-dark woolen cape fastened by a brooch inlaid with gold a brooch on which a great hound clenched and throttled to death a dappled fawn. ” he knew of course i ’ d given odysseus that very cape had dyed its wool that royal red had buckled its folds with that same brooch and so i suppose i passed his test the salt tears soaked my cheek a fact he took in silently beneath his rags though how could i not have recognized him with his poet ’ s words his poet ’ s unfazed self-concern so skillfully playing my emotions the truth is however much i loved that man in the wine-dark cape however much i ’ d longed for him i ’ d have settled for the man with thinning hair the beggar-king of ithaca ii having slept alone year after year in the upper story of our high-roofed home having awakened nightly in that rooted rightly far-famed bed he ’ d built by hand around the bole of a thickset olive tree i soon discovered there are two known gates through which all dreams must come to pass the first is made of ivory cleanly carved the second of polished horn through ivory our dreams are will-o ’ -the-wisps scant tracings on the air through horn they ’ re star-signs we ’ d be wise to chart our futures by it was through horn it came that night he questioned me beside the fire the contest of twelve axes one for each month of the year i ’ d lived through twenty times for him housebound to the labor of my hardwood loom the thwarted suitors watched agog he watched them watch though no one saw how could they how the hand that strung his bow recalled my own hand spooling out new wool that drew on strength enough to strike an arrow through a dozen axe-helve socket rings recalled the heart it took each night to climb back into the vaulted tomb of our empty tree-housed bed iii waiting at the doorway while i was brushing back my hair odysseus stood and stared across the unraked terrace gardens trashed from last night ’ s welcome home one guttering pine-pitch torch still burned its pool of light apotheosized to a ringing lyre—the singer ’ s who had begged him calm his bloodlust spare one pauper soul among that heavy haul of slaughtered men he ’ d been every inch the hero then spattered with gore his forehead glistening dripping red but this morning he looked to me just as he had looked before his thin shirt clung like onion skin to his boxer ’ s ropy shoulders his young man ’ s muscled chest and arms and as before those faraway slightly moonstruck eyes seemed focused on a flyspeck at the world ’ s end it struck me then that even as he stood there steeped in the memory of all this place brought home to him he labored at the anchor of whatever in me refused that death his heart most longed to master and as before i could see it coming his going away those maddened gulls scavenging after the trim black ship my harbored longings had driven out of reach

now swarthy summer by rude health embrowned precedence takes of rosy fingered spring and laughing joy with wild flowers prank 'd and crown 'd a wild and giddy thing and health robust from every care unbound come on the zephyr 's wing and cheer the toiling clown happy as holiday-enjoying face loud tongued and `` merry as a marriage bell '' thy lightsome step sheds joy in every place and where the troubled dwell thy witching charms wean them of half their cares and from thy sunny spell they greet joy unawares then with thy sultry locks all loose and rude and mantle laced with gems of garish light come as of wont for i would fain intrude and in the world 's despite share the rude wealth that thy own heart beguiles if haply so i might win pleasure from thy smiles me not the noise of brawling pleasure cheers in nightly revels or in city streets but joys which soothe and not distract the ears that one at leisure meets in the green woods and meadows summer-shorn or fields where bee-fly greets the ear with mellow horn the green-swathed grasshopper on treble pipe sings there and dances in mad-hearted pranks there bees go courting every flower that 's ripe on baulks and sunny banks and droning dragon-fly on rude bassoon attempts to give god thanks in no discordant tune the speckled thrush by self-delight embued there sings unto himself for joy 's amends and drinks the honey dew of solitude there happiness attends with inbred joy until the heart o'erflow of which the world 's rude friends nought heeding nothing know there the gay river laughing as it goes plashes with easy wave its flaggy sides and to the calm of heart in calmness shows what pleasure there abides to trace its sedgy banks from trouble free spots solitude provides to muse and happy be there ruminating 'neath some pleasant bush on sweet silk grass i stretch me at mine ease where i can pillow on the yielding rush and acting as i please drop into pleasant dreams or musing lie mark the wind-shaken trees and cloud-betravelled sky there think me how some barter joy for care and waste life 's summer-health in riot rude of nature nor of nature 's sweets aware when passions vain intrude these by calm musings softened are and still and the heart 's better mood feels sick of doing ill. there i can live and at my leisure seek joys far from cold restraints—not fearing pride— free as the winds that breathe upon my cheek rude health so long denied here poor integrity can sit at ease and list self-satisfied the song of honey-bees the green lane now i traverse where it goes nought guessing till some sudden turn espies rude batter 'd finger post that stooping shows where the snug mystery lies and then a mossy spire with ivy crown cheers up the short surprise and shows a peeping town i see the wild flowers in their summer morn of beauty feeding on joy 's luscious hours the gay convolvulus wreathing round the thorn agape for honey showers and slender kingcup burnished with the dew of morning 's early hours like gold yminted new and mark by rustic bridge o'er shallow stream cow-tending boy to toil unreconciled absorbed as in some vagrant summer dream who now in gestures wild starts dancing to his shadow on the wall feeling self-gratified nor fearing human thrall or thread the sunny valley laced with streams or forests rude and the o'ershadow 'd brims of simple ponds where idle shepherd dreams stretching his listless limbs or trace hay-scented meadows smooth and long where joy 's wild impulse swims in one continued song i love at early morn from new mown swath to see the startled frog his route pursue to mark while leaping o'er the dripping path his bright sides scatter dew the early lark that from its bustle flies to hail his matin new and watch him to the skies to note on hedgerow baulks in moisture sprent the jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn with earnest heed and tremulous intent frail brother of the morn that from the tiny bent 's dew-misted leaves withdraws his timid horn and fearful vision weaves or swallow heed on smoke-tanned chimney top wont to be first unsealing morning 's eye ere yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop of honey on his thigh to see him seek morn 's airy couch to sing until the golden sky bepaint his russet wing or sauntering boy by tanning corn to spy with clapping noise to startle birds away and hear him bawl to every passer by to know the hour of day while the uncradled breezes fresh and strong with waking blossoms play and breathe æolian song i love the south-west wind or low or loud and not the less when sudden drops of rain moisten my glowing cheek from ebon cloud threatening soft showers again that over lands new ploughed and meadow grounds summer 's sweet breath unchain and wake harmonious sounds rich music breathes in summer 's every sound and in her harmony of varied greens woods meadows hedge-rows corn-fields all around much beauty intervenes filling with harmony the ear and eye while o'er the mingling scenes far spreads the laughing sky see how the wind-enamoured aspen leaves turn up their silver lining to the sun and hark the rustling noise that oft deceives and makes the sheep-boy run the sound so mimics fast-approaching showers he thinks the rain 's begun and hastes to sheltering bowers but now the evening curdles dank and grey changing her watchet hue for sombre weed and moping owls to close the lids of day on drowsy wing proceed while chickering crickets tremulous and long light 's farewell inly heed and give it parting song the pranking bat its flighty circlet makes the glow-worm burnishes its lamp anew o'er meadows dew-besprent the beetle wakes inquiries ever new teazing each passing ear with murmurs vain as wanting to pursue his homeward path again hark 't is the melody of distant bells that on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds by fitful starts then musically swells o'er the dim stilly grounds while on the meadow-bridge the pausing boy listens the mellow sounds and hums in vacant joy now homeward-bound the hedger bundles round his evening faggot and with every stride his leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound till silly sheep beside his path start tremulous and once again look back dissatisfied and scour the dewy plain how sweet the soothing calmness that distills o'er the heart 's every sense its opiate dews in meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills that softens and subdues with gentle quiet 's bland and sober train which dreamy eve renews in many a mellow strain i love to walk the fields they are to me a legacy no evil can destroy they like a spell set every rapture free that cheer 'd me when a boy play—pastime—all time 's blotting pen conceal 'd comes like a new-born joy to greet me in the field for nature 's objects ever harmonize with emulous taste that vulgar deed annoys which loves in pensive moods to sympathize and meet vibrating joys o'er nature 's pleasing things nor slighting deems pastimes the muse employs vain and obtrusive themes

to one who has been long in city pent 't is very sweet to look into the fair and open face of heaven —to breathe a prayer full in the smile of the blue firmament who is more happy when with heart 's content fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair of wavy grass and reads a debonair and gentle tale of love and languishment returning home at evening with an ear catching the notes of philomel —an eye watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career he mourns that day so soon has glided by e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear that falls through the clear ether silently
is this the world miss bliss stacks of ingots on the docks where my brother works work and things on the threshold of raw and radiated bananas gassed in shacks to ripen by the forklifts ships of foreign port ships of car parts and dyes the beef-stripping business things miss bliss and work flavors translated from costa rica volatile oils seized cargoes incensed loads cracked coal after a week the exposed skin around his wrists was blue vein color the color of the world labor and the union of the senses to deliver us from our geography everywhere is here when the stevedores break for lunch one is responsible for the pot-luck of cold meats the deep dish leftovers from the wedding while one is responsible for inviting the office women these men set the table with the pomp of the late elizabeth linen gilt plates a taster and a trumpeted summons they force the choice bits on each other they talk about blood and solomon ’ s operation they talk about lily ’ s kids and the dead as they come hack to speak to lonnie in his sleep and they talk about food they could not eat the boss and a dream of playing lead before they switch on the tv with its loud prophecies of soap they eat deeply in gratitude the pot scraped with a spoon that sound the world ’ s a word and a lever the ghosts at the banquet want something miss bliss from one world i come to you with two blue wrists my brother ’ s rage against the living the world owes and everything i do that ’ s duplicate my cells split they can ’ t be true i smoke i turn out a little verse i make a small sacrifice i throw what can not be eaten away i throw it on the ground here some things you can ’ t eat
the skies they were ashen and sober the leaves they were crispéd and sere— the leaves they were withering and sere it was night in the lonesome october of my most immemorial year it was hard by the dim lake of auber in the misty mid region of weir— it was down by the dank tarn of auber in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir here once through an alley titanic of cypress i roamed with my soul— of cypress with psyche my soul these were days when my heart was volcanic as the scoriac rivers that roll— as the lavas that restlessly roll their sulphurous currents down yaanek in the ultimate climes of the pole— that groan as they roll down mount yaanek in the realms of the boreal pole our talk had been serious and sober but our thoughts they were palsied and sere— our memories were treacherous and sere— for we knew not the month was october and we marked not the night of the year— ah night of all nights in the year we noted not the dim lake of auber— though once we had journeyed down here — we remembered not the dank tarn of auber nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir and now as the night was senescent and star-dials pointed to morn— as the star-dials hinted of morn— at the end of our path a liquescent and nebulous lustre was born out of which a miraculous crescent arose with a duplicate horn— astarte 's bediamonded crescent distinct with its duplicate horn and i said— '' she is warmer than dian she rolls through an ether of sighs— she revels in a region of sighs she has seen that the tears are not dry on these cheeks where the worm never dies and has come past the stars of the lion to point us the path to the skies— to the lethean peace of the skies— come up in despite of the lion to shine on us with her bright eyes— come up through the lair of the lion with love in her luminous eyes '' but psyche uplifting her finger said— '' sadly this star i mistrust— her pallor i strangely mistrust — oh hasten oh let us not linger oh fly —let us fly —for we must '' in terror she spoke letting sink her wings till they trailed in the dust— in agony sobbed letting sink her plumes till they trailed in the dust— till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust i replied— '' this is nothing but dreaming let us on by this tremulous light let us bathe in this crystalline light its sybilic splendor is beaming with hope and in beauty to-night — see —it flickers up the sky through the night ah we safely may trust to its gleaming and be sure it will lead us aright— we safely may trust to a gleaming that can not but guide us aright since it flickers up to heaven through the night '' thus i pacified psyche and kissed her and tempted her out of her gloom— and conquered her scruples and gloom and we passed to the end of the vista but were stopped by the door of a tomb— by the door of a legended tomb and i said— '' what is written sweet sister on the door of this legended tomb '' she replied— '' ulalume—ulalume— 't is the vault of thy lost ulalume '' then my heart it grew ashen and sober as the leaves that were crispèd and sere— as the leaves that were withering and sere and i cried— '' it was surely october on this very night of last year that i journeyed—i journeyed down here— that i brought a dread burden down here— on this night of all nights in the year oh what demon has tempted me here well i know now this dim lake of auber— this misty mid region of weir— well i know now this dank tarn of auber— in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir '' said we then—the two then— '' ah can it have been that the woodlandish ghouls— the pitiful the merciful ghouls— to bar up our way and to ban it from the secret that lies in these wolds— from the thing that lies hidden in these wolds— had drawn up the spectre of a planet from the limbo of lunary souls— this sinfully scintillant planet from the hell of the planetary souls ''
after his ham cheese in the drape factory cafeteria having slipped by the bald shipping foreman to ride a rattling elevator to the attic where doves flicker into the massive eaves and where piled boxes of out-of-style cotton and lace won ’ t ever be decorating anyone ’ s sun parlor windows having dozed off in that hideout he fixed between five four-by-six cardboard storage cartons while the rest of us pack mediterranean dreams and colonial ruffles and drapes colored like moons and he wakes lost— shot through into a world of unlocked unlocking light— suddenly he knows where he is and feels half nuts and feels like killing some pigeons with a slingshot that ’ s all and that ’ s why he pokes his calloused fingers into the broken machinery hunting for loose nuts a half inch wide— five greasy cold ones that warm in his pocket— and yanks back the snag-cut strip of inner tube with a nut snug at the curve to snap it at the soft chest of a dopey bird then the noise of pigeons flopping down to creosoted hardwood and then a grin the guy gives me all his other pals later and afternoon tightens down on all our shoulders until the shift whistle blasts blowing through the plant like air through lace as it always has as it does that bright that stunned
in tunis we try to discuss divorce and dying but give up to lounge with rug merchants under a plum tree from its corner the lamb ’ s severed head watches the flies drink from its eyes and its fat disappear into the fire the light rinses the edge of your sandal the two wasps that ornament the blur of screened window my grandmother would have loved a night like this in the wind chimes i can hear her tea cart with its china rolling through cook street ’ s stony yard one summer when i was always thirsty and she moved like a figure on a clock from my lawn chair to the cart or swabbed me with alcohol or cut my hair with the straight razor i was a week out of the hospital beneath my breasts an incision was crossed with stitches of surgical thread the scalpel came so close it gave my heart a quick kiss i nearly died years later i can still see the skin flutter on the inside of my left breast and my heart limps like a great uncle who because he was a jew and lame was dragged by cossacks across the steppes he became a friend asking a favor of a horse who ran so hard so perfectly hard that the green grass rose to meet him
traveling through the dark i found a deer dead on the edge of the wilson river road it is usually best to roll them into the canyon that road is narrow to swerve might make more dead by glow of the tail-light i stumbled back of the car and stood by the heap a doe a recent killing she had stiffened already almost cold i dragged her off she was large in the belly my fingers touching her side brought me the reason— her side was warm her fawn lay there waiting alive still never to be born beside that mountain road i hesitated the car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights under the hood purred the steady engine i stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red around our group i could hear the wilderness listen i thought hard for us all—my only swerving— then pushed her over the edge into the river

i went to turn the grass once after one who mowed it in the dew before the sun the dew was gone that made his blade so keen before i came to view the levelled scene i looked for him behind an isle of trees i listened for his whetstone on the breeze but he had gone his way the grass all mown and i must be as he had been —alone ‘ as all must be ’ i said within my heart ‘ whether they work together or apart. ’ but as i said it swift there passed me by on noiseless wing a ‘ wildered butterfly seeking with memories grown dim o ’ er night some resting flower of yesterday ’ s delight and once i marked his flight go round and round as where some flower lay withering on the ground and then he flew as far as eye could see and then on tremulous wing came back to me i thought of questions that have no reply and would have turned to toss the grass to dry but he turned first and led my eye to look at a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared i left my place to know them by their name finding them butterfly weed when i came the mower in the dew had loved them thus by leaving them to flourish not for us nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him but from sheer morning gladness at the brim the butterfly and i had lit upon nevertheless a message from the dawn that made me hear the wakening birds around and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground and feel a spirit kindred to my own so that henceforth i worked no more alone but glad with him i worked as with his aid and weary sought at noon with him the shade and dreaming as it were held brotherly speech with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach ‘ men work together ’ i told him from the heart ‘ whether they work together or apart ’

shed a tear for twickham tweer who ate uncommon meals who often peeled bananas and then only ate the peels who emptied jars of marmalade and only ate the jars and only ate the wrappers off of chocolate candy bars when twickham cooked a chicken he would only eat the bones he discarded scoops of ice cream though he always ate the cones he ’ d boil a small potato but he ’ d only eat the skin and pass up canned asparagus to gobble down the tin he sometimes dined on apple cores and bags of peanut shells on cottage cheese containers cellophane from caramels but twickham tweer passed on last year that odd and novel man when he fried an egg one morning and then ate the frying pan

drunk on the umbrian hills at dusk and drunk on one pink cloud that stood beside the moon drunk on the moon a marble smile and drunk two young americans on one another far from home and wanting this forever— who needed god we had our bodies bread and glasses of a raw green local wine and watched our godless perfect darkness breed enormous softly burning ancient stars who needed god and why do i ask now because i ’ m older and i think god stirs in details that keep bringing back that time details that are just as vivid now— our bodies bread a sharp umbrian wine

you ’ re clean shaven in this country where trees grow beards of moss where even bank tellers look a little like banditos in vests as pungent as sweatsuits still you prefer the vegetable air to almost any other place on the map after the heart attack you considered paris— the flying buttresses the fractured light of its cathedrals the entire city refined and otherworldly ascending on its architectural wings— but decided you had no use for glory boulevards fur-lined with statues and expensive trees you admit on the whole the towns in this country are ugly one summer you drove toward nicoya a beautiful name that became your destination expecting a fragrant town of mango trees but found cattle grazing in the plaza rattling the tin plates in the ubiquitous chinese restaurant a coca-cola sign hung weathered and askew that ’ s perhaps why you like it it ’ s a country you can ’ t count on a country of misfits unable to take root in the mud the twentieth century has failed miserably creating neither factory nor industry but a thirst for soda pop like cosmetic surgery it is skin deep the clock is stuck in the rain and the mud of four o ’ clock there ’ s nothing to do but wait as if in a dry cave a room with a view of the waterfall pinned as you are beneath the downpour the waiter bends over your cup without filling it the storekeeper holds your change until the rain hypnotic and dramatic leaves the streets and the gutters the balcony and the air greener heavier— mildew blooming in the closet where your shoes powdered with a sea-green lichen resembles old bronze a pair of ancient goblets while iguanas lounge in the attic a prehistoric version of the domestic rat the office of the ministry a pink and crumbling building surrounded by dusty rose trees prints more money to prop the flimsy flowered currency you can ’ t predict what your american dollars will bring by morning in the hotel restaurant you meet the undesirable american he learns just enough of the local lingo to swing by living on a dwindling account and here and there a real estate swindle or the pensionado who buys two cigars offering you one the day his social security arrives like the cockroach the displaced have crawled through the cracks and selected for themselves an agreeable niche a place to start from scratch they thrive in the vegetable air you wonder how you ’ ll survive unfit unable to work lacking the predatory skills you ’ ve stayed in the trees a dreamer all your life even now wanting to believe a change of scenery will get you back on your feet a brief hiatus in the vegetable air tonight you walk along the damp streets an average steak a glass of wine swishing in your belly to your small room wedged between a jukebox and a dance hall there are so many things you can ’ t change— like the dull thrashing music you draw the blinds switch on the tiny cassette silence the click of the tape and then the familiar aria rising like the moon lifts you out of yourself transporting you to another country where for a moment you travel light
they are weighing the babies again on color television they are hanging these small bags of bones up in canvas slings to determine which ones will receive the dried-milk mush the concentrate made out of ground-up trash fish for years we have watched them back-lit by the desert these miles of dusty hands holding out goatskins or cups their animals dead or dying of rinderpest and after the credits come up i continue to sit through dinner with julia where in a french fish poacher big enough for a small brown baby an alaska salmon simmers in a court bouillon for a first course steak tartare to awaken the palate with it julia suggests a zinfandel this scene has a polite a touristy flavor to it and i let it play but somewhere oxfam goes on spooning gluey gruel between the parched lips of potbellied children the ones who perhaps can be saved from kwashiorkor—an ancient ghanaian word— though with probable lowered iqs the voiceover explains caused by protein deficiencies linked to the drought and the drought has grown worse with the gradual increase in herds overgrazing the thin forage grasses of the sahel this says the voice can be laid to the natural greed of the nomad deceived by technicians digging new wells which means a slow pan of the sand that the water table has dropped and now to julia ’ s table is borne the resplendent fish always the camera is angled so that the guests look up among them i glimpse that sly dean jonathan swift after the credits come up i continue to sit with those who are starving to death in a distant nation squatting back-lit by the desert hands out in my head and the dublin dean squats there too observing the population that waits for too little dried milk white rice trash fish always the camera is angled so they look up while their babies are weighed in slings on color television look into our living rooms and the shaded rooms we sleep in

the social instincts ... naturally lead to the golden rule —charles darwin the descent of man 1 holding her steady into the pitch and roll in raw midwestern hands ten thousand tons of winter wheat for the fall of rome still swallowing the hunger of the war the binnacle glows like an open fire east-southeast and steady anderssen the viking mate belaboring me for contraband my little book of einstein that “ commie jew. ” so much for the social instincts pacifism humanism the frail and noble causes i speak my piece for western civ light bends ... stars warp ... mass converts ... “ pipe dreams ” says the dane “ pipe dreams. ” “ well mate remember those jewish dreams made nightmares out of hiroshima and blew us out of uniform alive. ” he stomps down off the bridge some day he ’ ll fire me off his rusty liberty i read too much the ocean tugs and wrestles with ten thousand deadweight tons of charity trembling on degrees and minutes anderssen steams back in with coffee to contest the stars with einstein full ahead we haven ’ t come to darwin 2 freezing on the flying bridge staring at the night for nothing running lights of freighters lost in a blur of blowing snow we hold on through the midnight watch waiting out the bells with einstein in our wake the tricks are easier liberty churns on ten knots an hour toward rome one starry night we ride at last with darwin on the beagle endless ocean sea sickness revelations of toxodon and megalonyx—a voyage old as the eocene the watery death of genesis the going gets rough again the threat of all those bones churning the heavy swells anderssen a true believer skeptical and darwin trapped in a savage earthquake the heave of coastal strata conjuring the wreck of england lofty houses gone government in chaos violence and pillage through the land and afterward fossils gleaming white along the raw ridges “ limeys. ” anderssen puts his benediction to empire “ stupid limeys. ” after that we breathe a bit and watch the stars and tell sad stories of the death of tribes the bones the countless bones we talk about the war we talk about extinction 3 okinawa iwo jima slouching toward tokyo the only good jap is a dead jap we must get the bomb einstein writes to f.d.r. waking from the dreams of peace the noble causes get it first before the nazis do the only good nazi is an extinct nazi at the death of hiroshima all day long we celebrate extinction chugalugging free beer down at the px teen- age kids in khaki puking pints of three-point-two in honor of the fire no more island-hopping now to the murderous heart of empire later in the luxury of peace the bad dreams come “ certainly ” darwin broods “ no fact in the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated extermination of its inhabitants. ” 4 off somewhere to starboard the canaries palma tenerife sunrise backlights the rugged peaks as darwin twenty-two years old gazes at the clouds along the foothills longitudes ease westward it ’ s my birthday twenty-two years old as tenerife falls into the sunset i ’ m as greedy for the old world as darwin for the new bahia desire the palms and crimson flowers of the mediterranean clear water dancing with mines ahead of us a tanker burns the war will never end 5 “ you talk a lot ” says the melancholy dane “ you sure you ’ re not jewish yourself you got a funny name. ” “ well mate i ’ m pure celtic on one side pure orphan on the other therefore half of anything at all—jewish danish what you will a problem isn ’ t it for hitler say or the klan or even gregor mendel sweating out the summer in his pea patch ” the fact is i know those ancestors floating through my sleep an animal that breathed water had a great swimming tail an imperfect skull undoubtedly hermaphrodite ... i slide through all the oceans with these kin salt water pulsing in my veins and aeons follow me into the trees a hairy tailed quadruped arboreal in its habits scales slipping off my flanks the angle of my spine thrust upward brain bulging the skull until i ride the beagle down the eastern trades to earthquake to naked cannibals munching red meat and spanish grandees with seven names crushing the fingers of slaves who are my fathers mothers who will i ever father i will sire the one in my rubber sea-boots who has sailed the seas and come to the bones of megatherium from the war of nature from famine and death we stand at last creators of ourselves “ the greatest human satisfaction ” darwin muses “ is derived from following the social instincts. ” well the thing i want to father is the rarest most difficult thing in any nature i want to be knee-deep in these rivers of innocent blood a decent animal 6 landfall yankee liberty discharges calories on the docks where kids with fingers formed by hairy quadrupeds cross mumbo jumbo on their chests and rub small signs for hope and charity liberty sucked empty of its social instincts follows the beagle down the empty avenues of water to amber waves of grain to feed the children of our fathers ’ wars new generations of orphans lives our quaint old-fashioned bombs had not quite ended 7 alone on the fantail i hear the grind of rigging and darwin is beside me leaning on the rail watching the wake go phosphorescent we ’ ve been out five years have seen the coral islands the dark skins of tahiti i have questions “ darwin ” i whisper “ tell me now have you entered into the springs of the sea or have you walked in search of the depth did you give the gorgeous wings to peacocks or feathers to the ostrich have you given the horse his strength and clothed his neck with thunder who has put wisdom in the inward parts and given understanding to the heart answer me. ” the breeze is making eddies in the mist and out of those small whirlwinds come the words “ i have walked along the bottom of the sea wrenched into the clouds at valparaiso i have seen the birth of islands and the build of continents i know the rise and fall of mountain ranges i understand the wings of pigeons peacock feathers finches my mind creates general laws out of large collections of facts. ” the rigging sighs a little god is slipping away without saying goodbye goodbye to jewish dreams “ but the activities of the mind ” darwin murmurs “ are one of the bases of conscience. ” astern the pious spaniards go on praying and crushing the fingers of slaves somewhere the mylodon wanders away out of the animal kingdom and into the empire of death for five billion years we have seen the past and it works 8 so this is the final convoy of the social instincts the next time missiles fly to rome they will carry einstein ’ s dream of fire and afterward there will be no need for liberties hope or charity now we ride the oceans of imagination all horizon and no port darwin will soon be home his five-year voyage on this little brig all over but when will i be home when will i arrive at that special creation a decent animal the land is failing the horizons and we only know to take the wheel and test the ancient strength of human struggle remembering that we ourselves the wonder and glory of the universe bear in our lordly bones the indelible stamp of our lowly origin

`` the sun was shining on the sea shining with all his might he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright — and this was odd because it was the middle of the night the moon was shining sulkily because she thought the sun had got no business to be there after the day was done — '' it 's very rude of him '' she said `` to come and spoil the fun '' the sea was wet as wet could be the sands were dry as dry you could not see a cloud because no cloud was in the sky no birds were flying overhead — there were no birds to fly the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand if this were only cleared away they said it would be grand if seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year do you suppose the walrus said that they could get it clear i doubt it said the carpenter and shed a bitter tear o oysters come and walk with us the walrus did beseech a pleasant walk a pleasant talk along the briny beach we can not do with more than four to give a hand to each the eldest oyster looked at him but never a word he said the eldest oyster winked his eye and shook his heavy head — meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster-bed but four young oysters hurried up all eager for the treat their coats were brushed their faces washed their shoes were clean and neat — and this was odd because you know they had n't any feet four other oysters followed them and yet another four and thick and fast they came at last and more and more and more — all hopping through the frothy waves and scrambling to the shore the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so and then they rested on a rock conveniently low and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax — of cabbages — and kings — and why the sea is boiling hot — and whether pigs have wings but wait a bit the oysters cried before we have our chat for some of us are out of breath and all of us are fat no hurry said the carpenter they thanked him much for that a loaf of bread the walrus said is what we chiefly need pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed — now if you 're ready oysters dear we can begin to feed but not on us the oysters cried turning a little blue after such kindness that would be a dismal thing to do the night is fine the walrus said do you admire the view it was so kind of you to come and you are very nice the carpenter said nothing but cut us another slice i wish you were not quite so deaf — i 've had to ask you twice it seems a shame the walrus said to play them such a trick after we 've brought them out so far and made them trot so quick the carpenter said nothing but the butter 's spread too thick i weep for you the walrus said i deeply sympathize with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size holding his pocket-handkerchief before his streaming eyes o oysters said the carpenter you 've had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again but answer came there none — and this was scarcely odd because they 'd eaten every one ''
the mornings are his blue and white like the tablecloth at breakfast he ’ s happy in the house a sweep of the spoon brings the birds under his chair he sings and the dishes disappear or holding a crayon like a candle he draws a circle it is his hundredth dragonfly calling for more paper this one is red-winged and like the others he wills it to fly simply by the unformed curve of his signature waterwings he calls them the floats i strap to his arms i wear an apron of concern sweep the morning of birds to the water he returns plunging where it ’ s cold moving and squealing into sunlight the water from here seems flecked with gold i watch the circles his small body makes fan and ripple disperse like an echo into the sum of water light and air his imprint on the water has but a brief lifespan the flicker of a dragonfly ’ s delicate wing this is sadness i tell myself the morning he chooses to leave his wings behind because he will not remember that he and beauty were aligned skimming across the water nearly airborne on his first solo flight i ’ ll write “ how he could not contain his delight. ” at the other end in another time frame he waits for me— having already outdistanced this body the one that slipped from me like a fish floating free of itself
from an epigram by plato when i was a boy a relative asked for me a job at the weeks cemetery think of all i could have raised that summer that money and me living at home fattening and getting ready to live my life out on my knees humming kneading up docks and sumac from those flawless clerks-at-court those beautiful grocers and judges the polished dead of whom we make so much i could have stayed there with them cheap too imagine never to have turned wholly away from the classic cold the hill so laid out measure by seemly measure clipped and mown by old man albright the sexton that would have been a hell of a way to make a living thank you no i am going to take my last nourishment of measure from a dark blue ripple on swell on ripple that makes its own garlands my dead are the secret wine jars of tyrian commercial travelers their happiness is a lost beginning their graves drift in and out of the mediterranean one of these days the immortals clinging to a beam of sunlight under water delighted by delicate crustaceans will dance up thirty-foot walls of radiance and waken the sea shining on their shoulders the fresh wine in their arms their ships have drifted away they are stars and snowflakes floating down into your hands love
the way to the river leads past the names of ash the sleeves the wreaths of hinges through the song of the bandage vendor i lay your name by my voice as i go the way to the river leads past the late doors and the games of the children born looking backwards they play that they are broken glass the numbers wait in the halls and the clouds call from windows they play that they are old they are putting the horizon into baskets they are escaping they are hiding i step over the sleepers the fires the calendars my voice turns to you i go past the juggler ’ s condemned building the hollow windows gallery of invisible presidents the same motion in them all in a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing sort of poker with somebody ’ s old snapshots game i don ’ t understand they lose the rivers one after the other i begin to know where i am i am home be here the flies from the house of the mapmaker walk on our letters i can tell and the days hang medals between us i have lit our room with a glove of yours be here i turn to your name and the hour remembers its one word now be here what can we do for the dead the footsteps full of money i offer you what i have my poverty to the city of wires i have brought home a handful of water i walk slowly in front of me they are building the empty ages i see them reflected not for long be here i am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its hands have no names i have passed it i know oh necessity you with the face you with all the faces this is written on the back of everything but we will read it together

i wrap the blue towel after washing around the damp weight of hair bulky as a sleeping cat and sit out on the porch still dripping water it ’ ll be dry by supper by the time the dust settles off your shoes though it ’ s only five past noon think of the luxury how to use the afternoon like the stretch of lawn spread before me there ’ s the laundry sun-warm clothes at twilight and the mountain of beans in my lap each one i ’ ll break and snap thoughtfully in half but there is this slow arousal the small buttons of my cotton blouse are pulling away from my body i feel the strain of threads the swollen magnolias heavy as a flock of birds in the tree already the orange sponge cake is rising in the oven i know you ’ ll say it makes your mouth dry and i ’ ll watch you drench your slice of it in canned peaches and lick the plate clean so much hair my mother used to say grabbing the thick braided rope in her hands while we washed the breakfast dishes discussing dresses and pastries my mind often elsewhere as we did the morning chores together sometimes a few strands would catch in her gold ring i worked hard then anticipating the hour when i would let the rope down at night strips of sheets knotted and tied while she slept in tight blankets my hair freshly washed like a measure of wealth like a bridal veil crouching in the grass you would wait for the signal for the movement of curtains before releasing yourself from the shadow of moths cloth hair and hands smuggling you in
because a black bird flew across the road because the attendant at the pump turned surly because the uncertain weather made mother nervous and back home the telephone kept ringing in an empty house because a white bird flew across the road how far had they come how far did they go seeing along river after river between shores of brush and willow only the bend ahead and the bend behind under a sky featureless and hard as a shallow bowl through tautologies of a landscape unendingly repeated mile after mile down main street after main street replications of the same petty civic scenery hearing the ghosts of trains crossing between cornfields clattering over the points moaning above creosote and cinders as if the imagination could produce nothing more than the same landscape cornfields rivers and main streets pulling them like a magnet not toward but away from not into the future but away from the past until a white bird flew across the road with its mysterious message that said to some “ turn back ” and to the rest “ go on ”
at dawn wind out of the north hailflecks pebbly skates against windows i lie thinking the drainspout ’ s drip comes again in the basement faucet where i am crying a child betrayed by death ’ s new cardinal and the cat yawning on the porch where my grandmother found me risen now i see the river full-bodied its white wind-knotted hair swirling like hers the polar hickory is naked as a saber recalled by a girl long gone in the gold sauce of apples two leaves that might be cardinals returned tumble in the hard light at the brick fence nothing moves in boxwood where gray soldiers lie among the last of them she walked cupping apples staining her white frock who took a boy far back into the haze the shenandoah hills held where family stallions might walk aimless ground littered with purpling flesh beyond the cull of seasons through a gate nailed with leather belts in my mind i pass and enter the arthritic orchard tended by widows what i gather wakes me to think how bright on the tongue was the taste kept concealed sustained of flesh abiding months beneath the wintering house floors to reach this i must go down storm-worn stones and pick my steps past the sealed boxes of family debris nightgowns flannels ribbons birthspoons a pair of dulled skates flowers pressed in a moldy bible why is it we keep what we can not bear to use and can ’ t escape shoving ourselves into shrunken rooms edged with old foolishness unforgiven and unforgotten i fumble to the center and pull a yellow light down the ancient string still dependably there and stand in my head as she did playfully asking where they went i know i know i say back there in the dust where i ’ ve come again to look through tiny windows into skirts of boxwood a morning that sends me alive among gray soldiers at the house roots i see also blue preserving jars full of slick pulpy flesh she has put up in a juice thick as blood behind it all in dark eaves baskets of apples split pine boxes like generations steeping undisturbed by the tick and groan of housepipes veining the overhead i leave oh let me see her light bring back those stallion-feeders little red handfuls of joy look how long i ’ ve slept learning to walk straight into a dawn-silvered web where secret spiders spin ceaseless as the seasons above me ice takes each room i can hear feet pacing fretful halls yet here i lift my face and puff back all the silk in the world i hold every core peeled on this slab my fingers claw the meat of family stillness parting all the way to seeds oh widows of the air fill me with your cidery useless lying those bladed hours you fed me the dark rotting dreams of your love
in ocean 's wide domains half buried in the sands lie skeletons in chains with shackled feet and hands beyond the fall of dews deeper than plummet lies float ships with all their crews no more to sink nor rise there the black slave-ship swims freighted with human forms whose fettered fleshless limbs are not the sport of storms these are the bones of slaves they gleam from the abyss they cry from yawning waves `` we are the witnesses '' within earth 's wide domains are markets for men 's lives their necks are galled with chains their wrists are cramped with gyves dead bodies that the kite in deserts makes its prey murders that with affright scare school-boys from their play all evil thoughts and deeds anger and lust and pride the foulest rankest weeds that choke life 's groaning tide these are the woes of slaves they glare from the abyss they cry from unknown graves `` we are the witnesses ''
loaf after loaf in several sizes and never does it not look fresh as though its insides weren ’ t moist or warm crust not the kind that spices a room with the plump aroma of toast found on the table among shadows next to the kitchen phone dispatched fedex without return address though someone possibly more than one person loves me well then who amazing that bread should be so weightless down-light when handled as a me dying to taste it takes a slice which lasts just long enough to reach my mouth but then at the first bite nothing nothing but air thin air ... oh one more loaf of wonderbread only a pun for bread seductive visually but you could starve get rid of it throw it in the river— beyond which grain fields future food for the just and the unjust those who love and do not love
for maxine kumin a cylinder of maple set in place feet spread apart— and the heavy maul fat as a hammer but honed like an axe draws a semicircle overhead and strikes through the two new halves to leave the steel head sunk a half-inch in the block and the ash handle rigid in the air a smack of the palm gripping as it hits the butt end and the blade rolls out of the cut the half-logs are still rocking on the flagstones so much less than what we have been persuaded to dream this necessity for wood might have sufficed but it is what we have been taught to disown and forget yet just such hardship is what saves for if the stacked cords speak of felled trees of countless five-foot logs flipped end over end downhill till the blood is wrung from your back and snowbound warmth must seem so far off you would rather freeze yet each thin tongue torn from the grain when log-halves were sundered at one stroke will sing in the stove to remind you of hands of how mere touch is song in the silence where hands live—the song of muddy bark the song of sawdust like cornmeal and down and the song of one hand over another two of us holding the last length of the log in the sawbuck as inches away the chainsaw keeps ripping through hickory
out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day i paused and said 'i will turn back from here no i will go on farther—and we shall see the hard snow held me save where now and then one foot went through the view was all in lines straight up and down of tall slim trees too much alike to mark or name a place by so as to say for certain i was here or somewhere else i was just far from home a small bird flew before me he was careful to put a tree between us when he lighted and say no word to tell me who he was who was so foolish as to think what he thought he thought that i was after him for a feather— the white one in his tail like one who takes everything said as personal to himself one flight out sideways would have undeceived him and then there was a pile of wood for which i forgot him and let his little fear carry him off the way i might have gone without so much as wishing him good-night he went behind it to make his last stand it was a cord of maple cut and split and piled—and measured four by four by eight and not another like it could i see no runner tracks in this year 's snow looped near it and it was older sure than this year 's cutting or even last year 's or the year 's before the wood was gray and the bark warping off it and the pile somewhat sunken clematis had wound strings round and round it like a bundle what held it though on one side was a tree still growing and on one a stake and prop these latter about to fall i thought that only someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks could so forget his handiwork on which he spent himself the labor of his ax and leave it there far from a useful fireplace to warm the frozen swamp as best it could with the slow smokeless burning of decay
lines composed 21st february 1825 all nature seems at work slugs leave their lair— the bees are stirring—birds are on the wing— and winter slumbering in the open air wears on his smiling face a dream of spring and i the while the sole unbusy thing nor honey make nor pair nor build nor sing yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow bloom o ye amaranths bloom for whom ye may for me ye bloom not glide rich streams away with lips unbrightened wreathless brow i stroll and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul work without hope draws nectar in a sieve and hope without an object can not live
when the earth is turned in spring the worms are fat as anything and birds come flying all around to eat the worms right off the ground they like the worms just as much as i like bread and milk and apple pie and once when i was very young i put a worm right on my tongue i did n't like the taste a bit and so i did n't swallow it but oh it makes my mother squirm because she thinks i ate that worm
it was the schooner hesperus that sailed the wintry sea and the skipper had taken his little daughtèr to bear him company blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax her cheeks like the dawn of day and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds that ope in the month of may the skipper he stood beside the helm his pipe was in his mouth and he watched how the veering flaw did blow the smoke now west now south then up and spake an old sailòr had sailed to the spanish main '' i pray thee put into yonder port for i fear a hurricane `` last night the moon had a golden ring and to-night no moon we see '' the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe and a scornful laugh laughed he colder and louder blew the wind a gale from the northeast the snow fell hissing in the brine and the billows frothed like yeast down came the storm and smote amain the vessel in its strength she shuddered and paused like a frighted steed then leaped her cable 's length `` come hither come hither my little daughtèr and do not tremble so for i can weather the roughest gale that ever wind did blow '' he wrapped her warm in his seaman 's coat against the stinging blast he cut a rope from a broken spar and bound her to the mast `` o father i hear the church-bells ring oh say what may it be '' `` 't is a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast '' — and he steered for the open sea `` o father i hear the sound of guns oh say what may it be '' `` some ship in distress that can not live in such an angry sea '' `` o father i see a gleaming light oh say what may it be '' but the father answered never a word a frozen corpse was he lashed to the helm all stiff and stark with his face turned to the skies the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow on his fixed and glassy eyes then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed that savèd she might be and she thought of christ who stilled the wave on the lake of galilee and fast through the midnight dark and drear through the whistling sleet and snow like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept tow'rds the reef of norman 's woe and ever the fitful gusts between a sound came from the land it was the sound of the trampling surf on the rocks and the hard sea-sand the breakers were right beneath her bows she drifted a dreary wreck and a whooping billow swept the crew like icicles from her deck she struck where the white and fleecy waves looked soft as carded wool but the cruel rocks they gored her side like the horns of an angry bull her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice with the masts went by the board like a vessel of glass she stove and sank ho ho the breakers roared at daybreak on the bleak sea-beach a fisherman stood aghast to see the form of a maiden fair lashed close to a drifting mast the salt sea was frozen on her breast the salt tears in her eyes and he saw her hair like the brown sea-weed on the billows fall and rise such was the wreck of the hesperus in the midnight and the snow christ save us all from a death like this on the reef of norman 's woe
in a cerulean ruckus of quilts we played house off the big room where they laughed slowdragged weekends the eagle flies on friday the jukebox pulsed a rainbow through the papery walls we were paid a dollar to guard each other i was eight s. c. mae fourteen as we experimented with the devil mill workers changed money in the briny glow of bootleg overpowered by the smell of collards catfish candied yams granddaddy gabriel worked the cash register beside his second wife rosie belle i heard my mother father laugh like swimmers underwater a raw odor of lilies sweat filled the room my cousin ’ s hands moved over me smooth tough as a blues guitar somebody swore they saw a silhouette with a gasoline can the night s. c. mae ran away with a woman ’ s husband for weeks they sifted ashes but the gutted studs braces only leaned against the wind weak as a boy girl entwined on the floor that june granddaddy drove a busload up north the growers paid him a dollar a day for each pair of hands he wanted to rebuild those nights their circle of blurred cards the bus grunted between orchards by late august i had enough fire-blackened nickels dimes to fill a sock but only a few pickers came back after a season of wine-stained greenbacks sewn inside coats taped to the soles of their feet

you ask me why tho ill at ease within this region i subsist whose spirits falter in the mist and languish for the purple seas it is the land that freemen till that sober-suited freedom chose the land where girt with friends or foes a man may speak the thing he will a land of settled government a land of just and old renown where freedom slowly broadens down from precedent to precedent where faction seldom gathers head but by degrees to fullness wrought the strength of some diffusive thought hath time and space to work and spread should banded unions persecute opinion and induce a time when single thought is civil crime and individual freedom mute tho power should make from land to land the name of britain trebly great— tho every channel of the state should fill and choke with golden sand— yet waft me from the harbour-mouth wild wind i seek a warmer sky and i will see before i die the palms and temples of the south

the sky has been dark for many years my skin has become as damp and pale as rice paper and feels the way mother ’ s used to before the drying sun parched it out there in the fields lately when i touch my eyelids my hands react as if i had just touched something hot enough to burn my skin aspirin colored tingles with migraine mother has been massaging the left side of my face especially in the evenings when the pain flares up this morning her breathing was graveled her voice gruff with affection when i wheeled her into the bath she was in a good humor making jokes about her great breasts floating in the milky water like two walruses flaccid and whiskered around the nipples i scrubbed them with a sour taste in my mouth thinking six children and an old man have sucked from these brown nipples i was almost tender when i came to the blue bruises that freckle her body places where she has been injecting insulin for thirty years i soaped her slowly she sighed deeply her eyes closed it seems it has always been like this the two of us in this sunless room the splashing of the bathwater in the afternoons when she has rested she prepares our ritual of tea and rice garnished with a shred of gingered fish a slice of pickled turnip a token for my white body we eat in the familiar silence she knows i am not to be trusted even now planning my escape as i toast to her health with the tea she has poured a thousand cranes curtain the window fly up in a sudden breeze
strange bird his song remains secret he worked too hard to read books he never heard how sherwood anderson got out of it and fled to chicago furious to free himself from his hatred of factories my father toiled fifty years at hazel-atlas glass caught among girders that smash the kneecaps of dumb honyaks did he shudder with hatred in the cold shadow of grease maybe but my brother and i do know he came home as quiet as the evening he will be getting dark soon and loom through new snow i know his ghost will drift home to the ohio river and sit down alone whittling a root he will say nothing the waters flow past older younger than he is or i am

what over the gable-end and high up under tangled cloud that raven might be saying to its tumble-soaring mate or what the blackbird might intend when chattering among scattered breadcrumbs or what the bellowing of one cow then another in the near field might mean remains beyond my ken—being all noise for which no words will manage though all is language settling and unsettling the world beyond me and yet there ’ s the dunnock in all its dun colours at work among the small stones and patchy grass of the driveway and here ’ s the robin ’ s aggressive tilt at breadcrumbs and there goes the sudden shriek of the blackbird all alive inside the inhuman breath-pattern of the wind trawling every last leaf and blade of grass and flinging rain like velvet pebbles onto the skylight nothing but parables in every bristling inch of the out-of-sight unspoken never-to-be-known pure sense-startling untranslatable there of the world as we find it
—cincinnati ohio 1972 dear sister america late nights we lie under the spread and listen to the stereo jazz sounds of wtko on the fm station he says i am so fine in my tight pulled-back and strapless bed-sheet gown imagine the polyester with sequins a sultry dinah washington turn he puts a pillow on his stomach a finger to his lips and blows — he can do a louis like nobody else turn to the golden oldies sometimes he calls me his favorite supreme or his one and only apollo showgirl with the switch of a dial we move in unison in the infinite dark our flickering stations turn
this is a day when i covered no ground just pushed and shuffled my papers around nudged at letters and winced at bills sorting them out into different hills hunted fretfully for a ruler worried the overworked water cooler sharpened pencils and filled my pen then shuffled my papers around again
the twenty-fifth is imminent and every known expedient designed for making christmas pay is getting swiftly under way observe the people swarming to and fro somnambulating through the stores in search of ties and shirts and gloves to give until it hurts they 're eyeing gifts in saks and hearn 's and macy 's not to mention stern 's while earnest copywriters are hitching their copy to the star of bethlehem quite shamelessly for they are duty bound to see that peace on earth good will to men gets adequate results again
i shall foot it down the roadway in the dusk where shapes of hunger wander and the fugitives of pain go by i shall foot it in the silence of the morning see the night slur into dawn hear the slow great winds arise where tall trees flank the way and shoulder toward the sky the broken boulders by the road shall not commemorate my ruin regret shall be the gravel under foot i shall watch for slim birds swift of wing that go where wind and ranks of thunder drive the wild processionals of rain the dust of the travelled road shall touch my hands and face
october and the leaves turned late but strong rock maples and the reds clear brazen blaze long-burning feats of sugar through our ways their strident hold upon the back roads pulls our morning drive out to where oak woods road crosses the river that they call great works the nearby fields so rich it ’ s hard to breathe— the hay treacly with auburn grasses bronzed— we stop before a red farmhouse just shy of where the river runs where maple trees have laid the front lawns ravished with their loss from booker ’ s truck we pull out sacks and tools proceed to gather up the autumn ’ s spoils he holds each big bag open and i rake the broad red leaves together and inside the crop is so much greater than our work could ever capture even as we press it in right close to fill october ’ s urge but we have cleared a windfall just the same a clarity the season ’ s morning hues and our sweet chore have worked an art of fall as autumn and the great works trickle by we skim as much brimmed crimson as these few stout bags will hold within enough to lay four inches of the fall upon his fields october 's task has raked the colors high to turn 'em in the soil to bed with yield is just as good as planting winter rye
he startled to see a statue of blind justice really did loom over the courtroom but remained determined to scorn symbolism she needed a quarter to call her lover— the docket was full she ’ d be late for lunch— and he gave her one it was not a taunt acquiescence wager or plea it was a quarter the fact that they had done this— even this —together and cordially late nights at the dining room table with a bottle of cabernet sharp pencils a love supreme and an “ e-z workbook ” from the well-reviewed—the fact that they ’ d read reviews —don ’ t pay an attorney series as if they were learning portuguese or origami was not “ as if ” or “ like ” anything but just that a fact and not to be pressed for further significance this was part of the agreement they filled out the forms asked lawyer friends for language made stacks of books and towels cooked dinner together said “ excuse me ” passing in the hallway and even remembered each other ’ s mother ’ s birthdays as if not as if waiting for their case to be called they got hungry the bailiff pointed toward the snack bar in the basement which was packed with a class trip from the school for the blind in illo tempore such a gift would have caused them to turn to each other in love and wonder now no they didn ’ t even look to see she asked for fish sticks and he wondered if fish sticks were fish or like fish the children chewed their chicken fingers with calm deliberation staring out at what they saw then conveyed their limp paper plates with startling grace to the hinged swinging mouths of the trash cans which swallowed everything offered saying thank you thank you
chile 1834 a month before his dinner with the visiting spanish lawyer he had “ set out for the purpose of geologizing ” and rode back over the ridge of the chilecauquen with a huge jute bag of living shells from the sandy flats at the coast and with another as full of dead barnacles scraped from the rock a few months forward from that dinner —on the island of san pedro where the beagle was anchored awaiting him—he would be sneaking up on a fox “ of a kind very rare ” and donking it stoutly “ on the head with my geological hammer. ” the fox he ’ ll write “ is now in the zoological society. ” so what does he think when the spanish lawyer expresses a disbelief that the king of england would be so loco as to bother to ship to this sensible orderly country a man “ to pick up beetles and lizards and to break stones ” no the whiff of something “ off ” —like suspect meat—attends eccentric stunts like these “ i do not like it if one of us were to go and do such things in england do not you think the king of england would very shortly command us to leave his shores ” renous another student of bugs and rocks from germany is also there at dinner and he mentions then that once in a house in san fernando he ’ d been discovered contemplating the transformation of caterpillars to butterflies he couldn ’ t deny it there they were the writhing green proof in an open box “ the padres and the governor consulted and agreed it must be some heresy ” —and so renous was arrested darwin can only shake his head in a quiet bemusement as his guests converse those inchling creatures crawling over their chopped-up foliage heads as blunt as thimbled thumbs heretical how could anybody believe that the innocent jumble in the baskets and flasks of a naturalist is dangerous and lillian colton—the woman in owatonna minnesota who for forty years has avidly collected the seeds of that state and with them “ poking them into place with toothpicks and gluing them down ” has portraitured “ american presidents movie stars country musicians rock and roll legends scientific and religious leaders including mother teresa ” —what suspiciousness might seize the spanish lawyer if he saw her on her rounds what edgy wariness would grip him if he chanced on nellie staves “ at 87 perhaps the most famous adirondack trapper ” out in the summer to harvest shell-shaped fungus off the dead trees of those shaded spinous hills —she ’ ll work for twenty hours straight on one with the point of an old school compass stippling it into the scene of a great alert-eyed ram or a sunrise watching as the fungus ’ s own interior brown juices dye the image into permanence who would these represent for the spanish lawyer what forbidden other —a girl in the corner walling her attention

san ’ angelo there where he ’ d spent eight years as the inquisition hammered at his ideas and his calm resolve it was february 19th 1600 he was tied to an iron stake a wedge was stuffed in his mouth to prevent any final utterance of blasphemy and he was burned alive the leg skin bubbled off of his body like a christmas pig ’ s it turns out that a redone sky implies a redone god—and a god is intolerant of this a god is jealous of any counter claim to the pedigree of his cosmos yes but surely not this mushroom picker not this boy who simply speaks to invisible friends as he wanders around the alleys oh but that would depend on the given spanish lawyer of that given day and circumstance in ghent a cock was put on trial and sentenced to death for repeatedly disturbing the peace of the

favor in their reading life although we get along some shared affinity enables the church of the gay girls and the orthodox congregation of guy to coexist with an amiability still i ’ ve witnessed other people pass them by with the slitted ophidian stare of xenophobia suzette and edie —are they the new apostasy are they our own anne hutchinson in 1638 she was found guilty after a two-day trial of heresy—of being “ a woman not fitt for our society. ” with will she had embraced doctrinal misinterpretations “ some of them blasphemus others erroneus and all unsafe and of the devill of hell ” and she was excommunicated from massachusetts bay colony “ evermore. ” her actual crime —a claim “ the holy spirit illumines the heart of every true believer ” without the need of a minister intervening for this she was harried into the wilds —it was called a “ hiving-out ” —and set at the mercy of wolf and of winter “ and it were death to return. ” her other actual crime —that after a pregnancy she had been delivered “ of thirtie monstrus births or therabowts at once some of them bigger some lessr some of one shape some of an other few of any perfect shape none at all of them of human shape ” —which perhaps is what you ’ d expect from a woman of “ nimble witt and active spirit and verie voluble tonggue. ” at the republican convention it was indeed the voluble tongue that edie always flapped so saucily and too i ’ d guess her rainbow-hue we ’ re already bedded why not wedded t-shirt that on her side led inevitably to the violence a surly officer suggested that she move she pointed out how she was already in the caged-off square allowed for free-speech protest and had no intention of leaving there were “ gestures they exchanged ” and then a stun gun ’ s 50,000 volts were suddenly alive inside her just enough to crumple her into helplessness so that when the panic began she was trampled by friends and police alike a lung was crushed and when i visited three weeks later her skin was still a nightmare turkish rug of bruise for a moment i saw in the air around her the first disabling gust of snow in the woods at the border of massachusetts bay in 1638 to be fair i should add that the confrontational officer doing crowd control went home with his head little more than a pocket of blood and neural damage do not i warn you ever lightly cross a wiccan bowler terms

him are generations of him solemn and knowing we ’ re standing there in front of the house in a dim autumnal downpour and it wouldn ’ t look to anyone else like an even match my scrawny shouts his

teetotum and i ’ m screaming this and screaming this and screaming this until i see the rain become his face and for the only time except his mother ’ s funeral on a similar day of wet and chill in a shivering mix my father cries in front of me and god if he ’ s there must write my name down on a list that he ’ ll turn over to his deputies on earth —his spanish lawyers there are many terms for this but only one rain now it ’ s falling grayish twill on a hill along the coast of the chonos archipelago islands 1835. a mound of seals in the distance “ huddled together asleep they appeared to be of a loving disposition but even pigs would be ashamed of their dirt ” which is picked at by the turkey-buzzards terns gulls black-necked swans a deposit of sandstone “ four great snowy cones ” of the

never the bark and abalone mask cracked by storms of a mastering god never the gods ’ favored glamour never the pelagic messenger bearing orchards in its beak never allegory not wisdom or valor or cunning much less hunger demanding vigilance industry invention or the instinct to claim some small rise above the plain and from there to assert the song of another day ending lentil brown uncounted overlooked in the clamorous public of the flock so unlikely to be noticed here by arrivals faces shining with oils of their many miles where it hops and scratches below the baggage carousel and lights too high too bright for any real illumination looking more like a fumbled punch line than a stowaway whose revelation recalls how lightly we once traveled
featherweight lawn chair cooler for a footrest and me a squatter on the landlord 's dock where baitstealers teased a thousand times a day until rowdy boats and summer scared them deep day and night i snoozed on the porch beneath a filthy orbit of fanblades to the opera of my neighbors fighting and reconciling in the glow of stolen wattage i saw them swimming once maybe naked judging from their skittish talk but the water smeared their bodies pale particulars it was just me and the tickfaw river me with the taste of a tin can in my mouth feeling no pain lighting a cigarette backwards the tickfaw tricking me closer and closer with echoes and music out of nowhere is it funny that i was too lit to notice twenty-five orange yards of extension cord stretching from my outlet over the driveway shells to feed the hungry plug of their deep freezer mother would have pitched a fit if she discovered the stash of whiskey in the woodpile and my father was n't laughing if he looked down from his company of stars

the little pitiful worn laughing faces begging of life for joy i saw the little daughters of the poor tense from the long day 's working strident gay hurrying to the picture-place there curled a hideous flushed beggar at the door trading upon his horror eyeless maimed complacent in his profitable mask they mocked his horror but they gave to him from the brief wealth of pay-night and went in to the cheap laughter and the tawdry thoughts thrown on the screen in to the seeking hand covered by darkness to the luring voice of horror boy-masked whispering of rings of silks of feathers bought—so cheap —with just their slender starved child-bodies palpitant for beauty laughter passion that is life a frock of satin for an hour 's shame a coat of fur for two days servitude “ and the clothes last ” the thought runs on within the poor warped girl-minds drugged with changeless days “ who cares or knows after the hour is done ” —poor little beggars at life 's door for joy the old man crouched there eyeless horrible complacent in the marketable mask that earned his comforts—and they gave to him but ah the little painted wistful faces questioning life for joy
the day had finally come when everything there seemed misplaced or out of place as an ex 's box of things the unused beside the irreplaceable the easy- to-assemble uncomplicated now by disuse some hand of randomness leaving behind its lampshades stained like ancient maps its ladders still climbing upward and enough old tools to restart a world every drawer filled with the other half of things everything care embraced and held once as new left too ragged for another winter to wear its ring of keys dangling by a nail for rooms left long ago and whatever i said i 'd never forget found just as it seemed completely forgot—all its letters beginning with dear ...
down in the blue-green water at nightfall some selving shapes float fluorescing trance-dancing trembling to the rhythm of theodoxical marching- music that they hear over the mere noise of the breaking tide above stars in certain places along the shore roads cars carrying people on uncertain errands sordid and sacred and all the kinds in between halogen-lit a woman gets down from her all-wheel-drive velocipede enters through an obeying door a cyclopean store to buy unintelligent fresh fish and other objects whether formerly alive or formerly dead she comes out again a poor man calls to her selling his no-news- paper the disastrous head- lines smile and nod they announce the plans of steel patriots and undertakers ad-men and fallen vice-generals doping their stolen crusades but the woman has learned as i have learned as all of us must keep learning if we are to be good subjects how to make of a newspaper the mask of a locust calmly put it on and begin once more to eat everything up
my son 's been learning time big hand and little powers of sixty and of twenty-four the slow semaphore of days he 's brought home paper plates from kindergarten arrows pointing at his favorite hours so far the face of every clock has smiled and before we read to sleep each night he crosses off another square on the calendar above his bed counting down to christmas or to nothing in particular sometimes just a line he draws uphill or down check marks like the ones his teacher leaves on sheets he 's filled with capitals and lower cases other times a pair of thick lines like the crossed bones on a pirate 's flag an x as if to mark the treasure buried in some ordinary week no day yet a cross to bear
i happen in from another unremarkable tuesday in the realm of gratuitous sound but here i can hear again the quiet voices of the ontological the clink of ice cubes in uplifted glasses the scrape of chairs the mournful lowing of floorboards the long history of blood retold in my ears i scuffle to the bar thoughts drowned by my suddenly thunderous presence in this world and the silence flowing from the neon jukebox the silence going down smooth as the shot of loneliness that would naturally follow a billie holiday song if one were playing— —while everywhere hands are fluttering like sheets in winds of gossip hollering above last call for one more round

my dear children do you remember the morning when we climbed into the old plymouth and drove west straight toward the pacific we were all the people there were we followed dylan 's songs all the way west it was seventy the war was over almost and we were driving to the sea we had closed the farm tucked in the flap and were eating the honey of distance and the word `` there '' oh whee we 're gon na fly down into the easy chair we sang that over and over that 's what the early seventies were like we were n't afraid and a hole had opened in the world we laughed at las vegas there was enough gaiety for all of us and ahead of us was the ocean tomorrow's the day my bride 's gon na come and the war was over almost
quasi-scientific maybe but think of beautician a word that assumes loveliness is brought off by technology she prefers cosmetologist— how it seems to have something to do with the stars she believes she can see the future when she stares face-down at the globe of a stranger 's scalp and adjusts the tilt of his head at the academy she is learning about the tendencies of things to remain where they fall she knows some tricks— spritz and gel the so-called permanent wave she wonders where they come from this galaxy of dowdy customers some days her precision cuts hang like torn drapes on a dirty window i see you 've tried an asymmetrical look her instructor might say snipping corrections at the academy asymmetrical is spelled with a d. she came here to verify what she always suspected that straight hair must be curled curly hair straightened long hair cut short hair extended that what comes to us by fate is wrong
it is very stretchy we know that even if many details remain sketchy it is complexly woven that much too has pretty well been proven we are loath to continue our lessons which consist of slaps as sharp and dispersed as bee stings from a smashed nest when any strand snaps— hurts working far past the locus of rupture attacking threads far beyond anything we would have said connects
all evening i hunted the bird that wanted a cage of glass here where cemetery slides into creek fronting what was once the largest indoor leather mill in the world there the skins gathered for cleansing coloring scraping shipping off it closed three years after a lone sparrow set up camp behind the only desk in the only full-serve service station left in town where from four to seven nightly one summer i blackened the pages of books with my thumbs whatever it sought there— thumping its frightened body against glass into cabinets or out to the bays scrubbed raw with gasoline where the broken waited to be raised up hosed off fastened together in hope of coughing to life again— whatever it sought was not a dollar slipped through a window cracked because patronage was right for the aging ladies of august to provide from chryslers cool in the sun there was nothing to be found in books or boxes of parts and the tools hanging from pegs were as useless as my hands which could not patch together those straggling conveyances any more than i could with a tattered broom batter the bird to freedom as i swung at fluttering terror as i sought with useless devices some fortune reposed in corners of grease and dust
dropping napkins corks and non-compostables into the trash i see that friends have mistaken my everyday chopsticks for disposables helpfully discarding them alongside inedibles pork bones shrimp shells bitter melon among napkins and corks they do look compostable off-white wooden warped from continual washing — no lacquer no ornament but anyone who thinks these chopsticks are disposable doesn ’ t live with chopsticks in the comfortable way of a favorite robe oversized a bit broken thin paper napkins plastic forks and non-compostable takeout boxes constitute the chopstick ’ s natural habitat to many i hold dear with family or alone i ’ ll maintain that chopsticks aren ’ t disposable but if i can make peace with the loss of utensils when breaking bao with guests i ’ ll be one of them not digging in the napkins and corks compostable chopsticks are the answer everyday and disposable

the gods do not interest him nor their debris nor their terrible storms he already knows how a body is made to glow precursor to neon lights — how hunger is hereditary sons should not be haunted except by the dead and his father is sober now accepts tribute in silence and coca-cola he is thankful for strong knees for momentum that lives in the mouth and the hands here is the fish with the filigree scales here is the pot of rice — here here the grain of rice that makes the bowl a bowl tuna ’ s blood hardening in the water here is the night through which he runs realizing the floor has turned to tissue paper tearing into morning no the gods do not compel him he can not bear the sight of the sun an open sore — prefers the colors of its setting how they reflect the ocean ’ s currents always giving rise to something new or something he has forgotten the sky as a table mounds of rice glazed with soy gleaming like a display of mackerel like snow general upon the island ’ s winter spine days parade in their uniform hearts attack close markets open new ones he teaches his sons to gut fish does not despair his own hands ’ speed salt bandaging a cut memory fraying at the edges reaching always — the top of the ladder buried in light —
the two of them stood in the middle water the current slipping away quick and cold the sun slow at his zenith sweating gold once in some sullen summer of father and daughter maybe he regretted he had brought her— she 'd rather have been elsewhere her look told— perhaps a year ago but now too old still she remembered lessons he had taught her to cast towards shadows where the sunlight fails and fishes shelter in the undergrowth and when the unseen strikes how all else pales beside the bright-dark struggle the rainbow wroth life and death weighed in the shining scales the invisible line pulled taut that links them both
the loneliest days damp and indistinct sea and land a haze and purple fog horns blossomed over tides— bruises being born in silence so slow so out there around above and below in such hurts of sound the known world became neither flat nor round the steaming tea pot was all we fathomed of is and is not the hours were hallways with doors at the ends opened into days fading into night and the scattering particles of light nothing was done then nothing was ever done then it was done
i 've watched his eyelids sag spring open vaguely and gradually go sliding shut again fly up with a kind of drunken surprise then wobble peacefully together to send him home from one school early soon his lashes flutter in rem sleep i suppose he 's dreaming what all of us kings and poets and peasants have dreamed of not making the grade of draining the inexhaustible horn cup of the cerebral cortex where ganglions are ganging up on us with more connections than atoms in heaven but coming up once more empty i see a clear stillness settle over his face a calming of the surface of water when the wind dies somewhere down there he 's taking another course whose resonance let 's hope resembles the muttered thunder the gutter bowling the lightning of minor minions of thor the groans and gurgling of feral lovers and preliterate mowglis the songs of shamans whistled through bird bones a worried neighbor gives him the elbow and he shudders awake recollects himself brings back his hands from aboriginal outposts takes in new light reorganizes his shoes stands up in them at the buzzer barely recalls his books and notebooks meets my eyes and wonders what to say and whether to say it then keeps it to himself as today 's lesson
we are tender and our lives are sweet and they are already over and we are visiting them in some kind of endless reprieve from oblivion we are walking around in them and after we shatter with love for everything we settle in thou tiger on television chowing thou very fact of dreams thou majestical roof fretted with golden fire thou wisdom of the inner parts thou tintinnabulation is it not sweet to hand over the ocean's harvest in a single wave of fish to bounce a vineyard of grapes from one 's apron and into the mouth of the crowd to scoop up bread and offer up one 's armful to the throng let us live as if we were still among the living let our days be patterned after theirs is it not marvelous to be forgetful
pindar poet of the victories fitted names and legends into verses for the chorus to sing names recalled now only in the poems of pindar o nearly unpronounceable immortals in the dash oionos was champion oionos likmynios 's son who came from midea in wrestling echemos won—the name of his home city tegea proclaimed to the crowds doryklos of tiryns won the prize in boxing and the record for a four-horse team was set by samos from mantinea halirothios 's son and pindar poet of the olympian and isthmian and pythian games wrote also of the boundless and forgetful savannas of time what is someone the chorus sing in a victory ode—what is a nobody creatures of a day they chant in answer creatures of a day so where is the godgiven glory pindar says settles on mortals —bright as gold among the substances say the chorus paramount as water among the elements not in the victory itself petty or great of rich young greeks contending in games not in the poetry itself with its forgotten dances and pindar spinning among tiresome or stirring myths and genealogies the chanted names of cities and invoked gods and dignitaries— striving o nearly unpronounceable athletes to animate the air with dancing feet raising a golden pollen of dust a pervasive blur of seedlets in the sunlight whirling—beyond mere victory or applause or performance as victory is beyond defeat the one who threw the javelin furthest sang the chorus chanting pindar 's incantation against envy and oblivion was phrastor and when nikeus grunting whirled the stone into the air and it flew past the marks of all the competitors nikeus 's countrymen shouted his name after it nikeus nikeus and the syllables so say the lines pindar composed for the sweating chorus to chant—radiated for a spell like the silvery mirror of the moon
can the bald lie the nature of the skin says not it 's newborn-pale erection-tender stuff every thought visible —pure knowledge mind in action—shining through the skull i saw one a woman hairless absolute cleaning she mopped the green floor dusted bookshelves all cloth and concentration queen of the moon you can tell with the bald that the air speaks to them differently touches their heads with exquisite expression as she danced her laundry dance with the motes everything she ever knew skittered under her scalp it was clear just from the texture of her head she was about to raise her arms to the sky i covered my ears as she prepared to sing roar to let the big win resonate in the little room
the chain uncouples and his jacket hangs on the peg over hers and he 's inside she stalls in the kitchen putting the kettle on buys herself a minute looking for two matching cups for the lime-flower tea not really lime but linden heart-shaped leaves and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze she talks a wall around her twists the string tighter around the tea bag in her spoon but every conversation has to break somewhere and at the far end of the sofa he sits warming his hands around the cup he has n't tasted yet and listens on with such an exasperating show of patience it 's almost a relief to hear him ask it if you 're not using your body right now maybe you 'd let me borrow it for a while it is n't what you 're thinking no it 's worse why on earth did she find him so attractive the first time she met him propping the wall at an awkward party clearly trying to drink himself into some sort of conversation was it the dark uncomfortable reserve she took upon herself to tease him out of asking are you a vampire that depends he stammered are you a virgin no not funny but why did she laugh at him what made her think that he needed her that she could teach him something why did she let him believe she was drunk and needed a ride home why did she let him take her shirt off fumble around a bit on the spare futon passing back and forth the warm breath of a half-hearted kiss they kept falling asleep in the middle of and when he asked her why did she not object i 'd like to try something i need you to trust me younger and given to daydreams she imagined trading bodies with someone a best friend the boy she had a crush on but the fact was more fantastic a fairy-tale adventure where the wolf wins and hides in the girl 's red hood how it happens she does n't really remember drifting off with a vague sense of being drawn out through a single point of her skin like a bedsheet threaded through a needle 's eye and bundled into a body that must be his sometimes she startles as on the verge of sleep you can feel yourself fall backward over a brink and snaps her eyelids open to catch herself slipping out of the bed her legs swinging over the edge and feels the sudden sick split-screen impression of being for a second both she and her what he does with her while she 's asleep she never really knows flickers only conducted back in dreams walking in neighborhoods she does n't know and would n't go to overpasses ragweed cars dry-docked on cinderblocks wolf-whistles wanting to run away and yet her steps planted sure and defiant performing tasks too odd to recognize and too mundane to have made up like fixing a green salad with the sunflower seeds and peppers that she hates pouring on twice the oil and vinegar that she would like and being unable to stop her hands feel but are somehow not her own running over the racks of stacked fabric in a clothing store stroking the slick silk teased cotton and polar fleece as if her fingers each were a tongue tasting the knits and weaves harmless enough it 's what she does n't dream that scares her panic she ca n't account for faces familiar but not known déjà vu making a mess of memory coming to with a fresh love-bite on her left breast and the aftershock of granting another 's flesh of having gripped slipped in and fluttered tender mmm unbraided and spent the whole slow day clutching her thighs to keep the chafe from fading and furious at being joyful less at the violation less the danger than the sense he 'd taken her enjoyment for his own that was the time before the time she swore would be the last—returning to her senses she 'd grabbed his throat and hit him around the face and threw him out and sat there on the floor shaking she had n't known how hard it was to throw a punch without pulling it back now as they sit together on her couch with the liquid cooling in the stained chipped cups that would never match no matter how hard she stared at them he seems the same as ever a quiet clumsy self-effacing ghost with the gray-circled eyes that she once wanted so badly to defy that seemed to see her seeing him—and she has to admit she 's missed him why she scrolls back through their conversations searching for any reason not to hate him she 'd ask him what 's it like being a girl when you 're not a girl his answers when he gave them were n't helpful so evasively poetic it 's like a sponge somebody else is squeezing a radio tuned to all stations at once like having skin that 's softer but more thick then she remembers the morning she awoke with the smear of tears still raw across her cheeks and the spent feeling of having cried herself down to the bottom of something why was i crying she asked and he looked back blankly with that little curve of a lip that served him for a smile because i ca n't and that would be their secret the power to feel another appetite pass through her like a shudder like a cold lungful of oxygen or hot sweet smoke fill her and then be stilled the freedom to fall asleep behind the blinds of his dark body and wake cleanly and when she swings her legs over the edge of the bed to trust her feet to hit the carpet and know as not before how she never quite trusted the floor to be there no not since she was a girl first learning to swim hugging her skinny breastless body close to the pool-gutter skirting along the dark and darker blue of the bottom dropping out— now she can stand and take the cup out of his giving hand and feel what they have learned inside each other fair and enough and not without a kind of satisfaction that she can put her foot down clear to the bottom of desire and find that it can stop and go no deeper
miss a who graduated six years back has air-expressed me an imposing stack of forms in furtherance of her heart 's desire a ph.d. not wishing to deny her i dredge around for something laudatory to say that wo n't be simply a tall story in fact i search for memories of her and draw a blank—or say at best a blur was hers the class in that ungodly room whose creaking door slammed with a sonic boom whose radiators twangled for the first ten minutes and then hissed and this was worst subsided with a long regretful sigh yes there as every wednesday we would try to overlook cacophony and bring our wits to bear on some distinguished thing some poet sometime wrote miss a would sit calm in a middle row and ponder it blonde i believe and quiet so many are a dutiful note-taker not a star roundheads and cavaliers received their due notice from her before the term was through she wrote a paper on could it have been '' milton 's idea of original sin '' or was it `` deathbed imagery in donne '' whichever it was likely not much fun for her it was n't bad though i 've seen better but i can hardly say that in a letter like this one now refusing to take shape even as wispy memories escape the reach of certitude try as i may i can not render palpable miss a who with five hundred classmates left few traces when she decamped those mortarboard-crowned faces multitudes beaming ardent to improve a world advancing dumbly in its groove crossing the stage that day—to be consigned to a cold-storage portion of the mind what could be sadder she remembered me the transcript says i gave miss a a b

parmi beaucoup de poèmes il y en avait un dont je ne parvenais pas à me souvenir sinon que je l'avais composé autrefois en descendant cette rue du côté des numéros pairs de cette rue baignée d'une matinée limpide une rue de petites boutiques persistantes entre la seine sinistrée et l'hôpital un poème écrit avec mes pieds comme je compose toujours les poèmes en silence et dans ma tête et en marchant mais je ne me souviens de rien que de la rue de la lumière et du hasard qui avait fait entrer dans ce poème le mot `` respect '' que je n'ai pas l'habitude de faire vibrer dans les pages mentales de la poésie au-delà de lui il n'y a rien et ce mot ce mot qui ne bouge pas atteste la cessation de la rue comme un arbre oublié de l'espace among many poems among many poems there was one which i could n't remember except having made it up long ago while going down that street on the even-numbered side of that street bathed in a limpid morning a street of little shops still lasting between the hospital and the wounded seine a poem written with my feet as i always make up my poems in silence and in my head while walking but i remember nothing except the street the light and the chance that had caused the entry in the poem of the word `` respect '' that i do n't usually set resounding in poetry 's mental pages beyond it there is nothing and this word this unmoving word awaits the ending of the street like a tree space has forgotten

surprised by a frill of white flower where i 'd never planted an eye i decided to fence it with sticks and let the renegade live in undoctored soil where the garden gave way to volunteer poplars and acidic white pine why not after all away from the tribe in clay where beetles drill and weeds emerge inspired it might grow eccentric proliferate and thrive when autumn air said disinter to fill the bin for winter i troweled under and pulled the stem until a rabble of rough spuds red as etruscan urns emerged as if to prove that whatever urge drove the rogue to sow itself and strive beyond all cultivation might offer a vital lesson to any apostate instinct aspiring to survive

green and brown current of river reverberant iron bridge crossing over woman and child fixed at the center holding hands and both weeping because her child is weeping because his mother weeps because the river far underfoot glitters through cracks in the wooden flooring that widen perceptively as he steps ahead heightened by a hill dwarfed in yellow trees the house is made ready all should have been primer-perfect including the train rushing headlong past the station always in arrears never deigning to stop and put down a stepping-stool nothing more is given except perhaps an assignment of cause a plank has fallen away to the river the two figures clasp hands across the gulf rocking back and forth in soundless oscillation there on the bridge where my mind proposes to leave them in place my mother and me on the first day of school 1921
when they first came their mouths agape their bodies shining like beetles about to stir every edge poised for the multitude of steps some moment of leaping not yet taken their hides stiff shielding some tenderness within warming to the creak of movement over penitent steps or dusty wastes unyielding tasks or stony memorials of waiting through the heat of day's quiet middle every icy threshold or soggy spring their heels flush with pavement their soles flung aside only for love all the tattered maps of their seams every unforgiving rub
there is the sudden silence of the crowd above a player not moving on the field and the silence of the orchid the silence of the falling vase before it strikes the ﬂoor the silence of the belt when it is not striking the child the stillness of the cup and the water in it the silence of the moon and the quiet of the day far from the roar of the sun the silence when i hold you to my chest the silence of the window above us and the silence when you rise and turn away and there is the silence of this morning which i have broken with my pen a silence that had piled up all night like snow falling in the darkness of the house— the silence before i wrote a word and the poorer silence now

can you imagine the air filled with smoke it was the city was vanishing before noon or was it earlier than that i ca n't say because the light came from nowhere and went nowhere this was years ago before you were born before your parents met in a bus station downtown she 'd come on friday after work all the way from toledo and he 'd dressed in his only suit back then we called this a date some times a blind date though they 'd written back and forth for weeks what actually took place is now lost it 's become part of the mythology of a family the stories told by children around the dinner table no they are n't dead they 're just treated that way as objects turned one way and then another to catch the light the light overflowing with smoke go back to the beginning you insist why is the air filled with smoke simple we had work work was something that thrived on fire that without fire could n't catch its breath or hang on for life we came out into the morning air bernie stash williams and i it was late march a new war was starting up in asia or closer to home one that meant to kill us but for a moment the air held still in the gray poplars and elms undoing their branches i understood the moon for the very first time why it came and went why it was n't there that day to greet the four of us before the bus came a small black bird settled on the curb fearless or hurt and turned its beak up as though questioning the day `` a baby crow '' someone said your father knelt down on the wet cement his lunchbox balanced on one knee and stared quietly for a long time `` a grackle far from home '' he said one of the four of us mentioned tenderness a word i was n't used to so it was n't me the bus must have arrived i 'm not there today the windows were soiled we swayed this way and that over the railroad tracks across woodward avenue heading west just like the sun hidden in smoke

a reflection on my students they are so beautiful and so very young they seem almost to glitter with perfection these creatures that i briefly move among i never get to stay with them for long but even so i view them with affection they are so beautiful and so very young poised or clumsy placid or high-strung they 're expert in the art of introspection these creatures that i briefly move among— and if their words do n't quite trip off the tongue consistently with just the right inflection they remain beautiful and very young still i have to tell myself it 's wrong to think of them as anything but fiction these creatures that i briefly move among— because like me they 're traveling headlong in that familiar vertical direction that coarsens beautiful blackmails young— the two delusions we all move among

along the airy azure of the larkspur spires would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales with tool-evasive rapture phrase on phrase where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash and the black cypress like a deep bassoon would hum a clouded amber melody but all across the trudging ragged chords that are the tangled grasses in the heat the mariposa lilies fluttering like trills upon some archangelic

wake me in south galway or better yet in clare you 'll know the pub i have in mind improvise a hearse—one of those decrepit postal vans would suit me down to the ground— a rust-addled renault kelly green with a splash of oscar wilde yellow stirred in to clash with the dazzling perfect meadows and limestone on the coast road from kinvara down toward ballyvaughan once you 've got in off the road at newquay push aside some barstools and situate me up in front by the door where the musicians sit their table crowded with pints and a blue teapot a pouch of drum some rolling papers and tin whistles ask charlie piggott to play a tune that sounds like loss and guinness turf smoke and rain while brenda dips in among the punters like a hedge-wren will i hear it maybe not but i hear it now the smoke of the music fills my nostrils i feel the attuned box and fiddle in harness pulling the plough of the melody turning the bog-dark root-tangled ground even the ceramic collie on the windowsill cocks an ear as the tune lifts and the taut sail of the galway hooker trills wildly in its frame on the wall rippling to the salt pulse and seabreeze of a west clare reel many a night two octaves of one tune we sat here side by side your body awake to a jig or slide me mending the drift of a line as the music found a path to my notebook lost in its lilt and plunge i would disappear into the heathery freedom of a slow air or walk out under the powerful stars to clear my head of thought and breathe their cooled-down fire when my own session ends let me leave like that porous to the wind that blows off the ocean goodbye to the company and step into the night completed and one-off like a well-played tune— beyond the purified essence of hearth fires rising from the life of the parish past smoke and stars released from everything i 've done and known i wo n't go willingly it 's true but i 'll be gone
because someone thirsty enough to trust old testament wisdom followed the deepening greens and found a spring silver in the shadow of blue ridges i can kneel beneath this spill of willow limbs a century later and drink water risen from roots to enter the evening through a spout the way cherokee stories say the first people were born washing into the world of such trees whose bark like the water i cup to my parched mouth tastes leafy and sweet and has the power the old ones say to heal
i imagined the atmosphere would be clear shot with pristine light not this sulphurous haze the air ionized as before a thunderstorm many have pictured a river here but no one mentioned all the boats their benches crowded with naked passengers each bent over a writing tablet i knew i would not always be a child with a model train and a model tunnel and i knew i would not live forever jumping all day through the hoop of myself i had heard about the journey to the other side and the clink of the final coin in the leather purse of the man holding the oar but how could anyone have guessed that as soon as we arrived we would be asked to describe this place and to include as much detail as possible— not just the water he insists rather the oily fathomless rat-happy water not simply the shackles but the rusty iron ankle-shredding shackles— and that our next assignment would be to jot down off the tops of our heads our thoughts and feelings about being dead not really an assignment the man rotating the oar keeps telling us— think of it more as an exercise he groans think of writing as a process a never-ending infernal process and now the boats have become jammed together bow against stern stern locked to bow and not a thing is moving only our diligent pens

here in italy the buildings are the color of dead skin and the sky is “ tragic ” and the rivers are brown and turbulent and everybody is always stopping by to say “ ciao ” and then “ ciao ” we think a lot about emotion chiefly the emotion of love there is much to cry about and after sleep one falls in love so as not to fall asleep i have just awakened to the fact that i am not in love and am about to fall asleep or write an opera in which someone falls asleep and dies or write a letter to a friend or call somebody up to meet me later for a drink maybe it ’ s too late tomorrow i will go out and buy something to make me happy i remember standing in the train station in pisa hoping to catch the sound of an american voice in the crowd it ’ s good to remember such things when you think you haven ’ t “ lived ” enough because you need to learn not to regret what you ’ ve never done fortunately i remember everything that 's ever happened to me i remember asking a woman i did n't know whether or not she was the person i was looking for and she said “ yes much to my regret. ” that wasn ’ t difficult to remember because it just happened a few minutes ago other things are harder i don ’ t remember right away what i had for breakfast two weeks ago last thursday or the specific date of my first masturbation though i ’ m sure that with some effort i could recover the lasting details i remember my father using a green hair tonic called “ h-a ” which stood for “ hair arranger. ” i remember the night my father tore out a big clump of my mother 's hair in an argument they were drunk and i came out of my room in my pajamas and asked them to stop if i said i wanted to fall apart in someone ’ s arms you would have to assume i was being sarcastic and you would be right no one has arms in which i care to fall apart at least not at the moment tomorrow night i am going to see a play about “ a contemporary man in the process of falling apart. ” i think everyone falls apart about twenty times a day i ’ m still confused about why i mentioned italy at the beginning of this poem especially since it ’ s all a terrible lie my students would say it means “ the poet does not know where he is some catastrophe has distorted his perceptions. ” i am drowsy but happy and resemble the corner of a big empty room i am drunk and staring into the bathtub a lot of people are standing around listening to music my fingers smell like cigarettes i am wondering if there is any way to describe the pleasure someone derives from seeing a man ’ s cock shoved up someone ’ s ass or how one can go on like this even after having given up completely to nervousness and to death i remember the one night i spent on a ship the porters woke us at dawn we stood at the railing to sight the blue and transparent island gaping through mist in the distance for breakfast we ate peaches i hated the people i was with but i must have been incredibly stupid we spent the day on the island seesawed in the park and waded in the sea
there is a brand of play called muteness beneath the play yard ’ s interlacing branches it appeals to children born entre deux guerres whose specialty it is it is mutiny that is a tongue of foreign origin ending in grunts one such child uses his tongue on a frozen fence for the embrace of it for the mutating appendage makes of speech a combat an internment there is a brand of child assisted to the play yard by his keeper fussing with his zipper yes it is cold in the high hemisphere and nothing will be the death of him as he sets hard sweets on his tongue he neither chews nor swallows such children can never swing too freely from the elm ’ s loping barkless arm it is mutual there is smoke on the air tarry commuting the industry on high as the children simmer within their word-cloud and someone or something is calling them home a familiar voice if they have one

—for fleda it seems so different art that moves me now from the sort of art i longed for long ago soaring vatic agon i waited yesterday on the unsure shoulder of a drenched back road from my car i could behold our highway agent gordon fill a rut with a spade climb up on his grader and smooth things smooth as the top of a kitchen table there were frost heaves by the score and culverts clotted shut by april floods so it was brilliant what gordon did with mud on wallace hill pure mire out there the road goes narrow as a needle on which you might wonder could dance how many angels i do n't care i didn't no earthly need to summon spirits daemons no sign of them at all nor would i dream one i might have once but wouldn't nor gyre nor golem nor great leviathan nor djinn nor fiend nor signifying wind nor elementargeist that lingering in that lane might make me conjure i had to get somewhere and fetch my daughter to bring her home sweet christ she might be standing in that mix of sleet and ugly rain which called for gordon 's art i 'm trying to be a grownup better late than never i suppose or am i only jaded i do n't know it was as though i 'd shown up just to see him wield his spade and blade out there it kept me from surmising some furor divinis why should i bother now that i moved on thanks be to gordon who signaled with his thumb for me to pass him he pulled the grader over yes give me something useful here i said impromptu in my car it sounded odd to say it now sounds different i hope that gordon watched me yesterday as i signaled back i 'd never have made my way without a skillful agent i hope he saw me wave
why and by whose power were you sent what do you see that you may wish to steal why this dancing why do your dark bodies drink up all the light what are you demanding that we feel have you stolen something then what is that leaping in your chest what is the nature of your mission do you seek to offer a confession have you anything to do with others brought by us to harm then why are you afraid and why do you invade our night hands raised eyes wide mute as ghosts is there something you wish to confess is this some enigmatic type of test what if we fail how and to whom do we address our appeal
for the geechee gullah ring shouters one of the women greeted me i love you she said she didn't know me but i believed her and a terrible new ache rolled over in my chest like in a room where the drapes have been swept back i love you i love you as she continued down the hall past other strangers each feeling pierced suddenly by pillars of heavy light i love you throughout the performance in every handclap every stomp i love you in the rusted iron chains someone was made to drag until love let them be unclasped and left empty in the center of the ring i love you in the water where they pretended to wade singing that old blood-deep song that dragged us to those banks and cast us in i love you the angles of it scraping at each throat shouldering past the swirling dust motes in those beams of light that whatever we now knew we could let ourselves feel knew to climb o woods—o dogs o tree—o gun—o girl run o miraculous many gone— o lord—o lord—o lord— is this love the trouble you promised
on the pan american highway somewhere between the north and south continent you come across a chain of volcanoes a coast with a thick growth of palm trees crunching waves of the sea an isthmus neruda called “ slender earth like a whip. ” when the road bends turns into a street the walls splattered with “ yanqui go home ” you see a boy fifteen years old barefoot sniffing glue in a small plastic bag an old woman in an apron will step out say “ this is the right street. ” in the public square there will be no friend from school to welcome you no drive to sonsonate city of coconuts no one to order cold pilseners oyster cocktails or convince the waitress into dancing a cumbia or two with you instead at the local bar you ’ ll raise a bottle next to strangers stub your cigarette out on the floor you ’ ll watch a country ten years after the civil war an old man sitting on the curb head between knees open hand stretched out everything will hurt your hair your toenails even your shoes you ’ ll curse dusty streets demented sun slowly burning the nape of your neck stray dogs following you to the park by nightfall you drag yourself back to the bars looking for a lost country in a shot of tíc táck against the wall three men with their guitars when you lie on a hotel bed too tired to sleep when you feel torn twisted like an old newspaper blown from city to city you have reached the place you have begun to speak like a man by the side of the road barefoot
in the first taxi he was alone tra-la no extras on the clock he tipped ninepence but the cabby while he thanked him looked askance as though to suggest someone had bummed a ride in the second taxi he was alone tra-la but the clock showed sixpence extra he tipped according and the cabby from out his muffler said ‘ make sure you have left nothing behind tra-la between you ’ in the third taxi he was alone tra-la but the tip-up seats were down and there was an extra charge of one-and-sixpence and an odd scent that reminded him of a trip to cannes as for the fourth taxi he was alone tra-la when he hailed it but the cabby looked through him and said ‘ i can ’ t tra-la well take so many people not to speak of the dog ’
yes i wanted them to levitate unfortunately i had n't a leg to stand on cut-out camels plodded across the blackboard 's high sill yet the desert below refused to unfurl its mica wings when i asked them to try to remember to release a soap bubble from their marvelous arsenal of wands they resisted they lined up suspicious in individual spotlights the fountain inside the scissored palm could only rise so high maybe just a trumpeted c. which is high but not like those huge blue dreams that used to float by shot from cloud-atomizers the original public breeze on its back in the grass let 's try to guess who or what is being borne up by this caravan of thin- skinned humps a-bulge inoculated i tell you every one has a rider a crop it 's been done this way for some time if we pause here by the pillars of sand up to our poet-knees in anarchy wo n't each gulp of hoarded water from the toppled monument be sweeter passed hand to hand in the sun-colored dipper up to our thighs in it now and spared what drills it- self into the rock daily so it can claim to know zero after zero and make that nothing into a sound like silent bells split parched hooves plodding
it 's best to wake early four five a.m. while the neighbors sleep and the moon floats like a pearl in a pool of ink in half-light the empty house is less familiar less sad—the walls with their nail holes the carpet—its patterns of wear curtains with no job to do i sit on my suitcase eat powdered donuts a napkin for a plate juice out of a paper cup make one last check of the cupboards the drawers run my hand along the countertops the stair rail trace the walls with my fingertips each scar proof of my childhood my initials carved into the tree of this our sixth house my family could write a handbook for leaving— the way we pack up during summer solstice disconnect from people and places like an abrupt shutting off of electricity my father 's convinced himself that the unknown is always better the way the retina sees images upside down and the brain corrects here i smoked candy cigarettes my breath in winter passing for smoke pale green of my bedroom i counted the number of intersections on the way to school four i bundle memories together weight them with stones like unwanted kittens drowned in a creek what kind of animal constantly moves the point of migration is the return we 're nomads without the base knowledge of where to find water these moves are like arranged marriages economics now love later maybe it 's not against nature to move most of the body is no more than ten years old and blood renews itself every 90 days but leaving disturbs the fabric of a place i 'd rather stay and witness change my mother always wanting to plant perennials that we never stay to see i pour some water on the marigolds clattering around the mailbox aztec flowers of death their strong scent a beacon to lost souls then we drive away the blank windows like the blank eyes of the dead waiting for someone to seal the past with a penny
let ’ s say i ’ m captain cook setting sail to drift until currents push me into a certain lane certain highway with its humpbacked traffic bobbing along my young aren ’ t strapped in the back flinging cheerios into the crevices like a game of darts but moored in the house with my patient wife so i can seek my destiny here— and i have no destination not the friendly center or aquarium—i journey only to find a usable route i ’ m stewing the bones a fourth time to leach any last savor for my broth— not gumming pirate birthday cake with seafoam-colored frosting nor placing my order at the drive-thru no not a frosty not a mcrib ­­— place-names are still to be scrawled new-minted to mark this passage its weather and bits of luck the usable route ’ s a velvet highway i ’ ll trace to parchment—a new day a new world not the gps lady recalculating— these words held in my mouth these words a way to inscribe we are not lost in a vast expanse of lostness
gay little girl-of-the-diving-tank i desire a name for you nice as a right glove fits for you—who amid the malodorous mechanics of this unlovely thing are darling of spirit and form i know you—a glance and what you are sits-by-the-fire in my heart my limousine-lady knows you or why does the slant-envy of her eye mark your straight air and radiant inclusive smile guilt pins a fig-leaf innocence is its own adorning the bull-necked man knows you—this first time his itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health and thinks not of his avocation i came incuriously— set on no diversion save that my mind might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds in the presence of a blind crowd the color of life was gray everywhere the setting seemed right for my mood here the sausage and garlic booth sent unholy incense skyward there a quivering female-thing gestured assignations and lied to call it dancing there too were games of chance with chances for none but oh girl-of-the-tank at last gleaming girl how intimately pure and free the gaze you send the crowd as though you know the dearth of beauty in its sordid life we need you—my limousine-lady the bull-necked man and i. seeing you here brave and water-clean leaven for the heavy ones of earth i am swift to feel that what makes the plodder glad is good and whatever is good is god the wonder is that you are here i have seen the queer in queer places but never before a heaven-fed naiad of the carnival-tank little diver destiny for you like as for me is shod in silence years may seep into your soul the bacilli of the usual and the expedient i implore neptune to claim his child to-day

a peacock on an olive branch looks beyond the grove to the road beyond the road to the sea blank-lit where a sailboat anchors to a cove as it is morning below deck a man is pouring water into a cup listening to the radio-talk of the ships barges dead in the calms awaiting port call pleasure boats whose lights hours ago went out fishermen setting their nets for mullet as summer tavernas hang octopus to dry on their lines whisper smoke into wood ovens sweep the terraces clear of night putting the music out with morning light and for the breath of an hour it is possible to consider the waters of this sea wine-dark to remember that there was no word for blue among the ancients but there was the whirring sound before the oars of the great triremes sang out of the seam of world through pine-sieved winds silvered by salt flats until they were light enough to pass for breath from the heavens troubled enough to fell ships and darken thought — then as now the clouds pass roosters sleep in their huts the sea flattens under glass air but there is nothing to hold us there not the quiet of marble nor the luff of sail fields of thyme a vineyard at harvest and the sea filled with the bones of those in flight from wars east and south our wars their remains scavenged on the seafloor and in its caves belongings now a flotsam washed to the rocks stand here and look into the distant haze there where the holy mountain with its thousand monks wraps itself in shawls of rain then look to the west where the rubber boats tipped into the tough waves rest your eyes there remembering the words of anacreon himself a refugee of war who appears in the writings of herodotus i love and do not love i am mad and i am not mad like you he thought himself not better nor worse than anyone else

essay 1 mrs. goldberg ’ s ap intro to lit shakespeare understood the blues he knew parting was such sweet sorrow mr. shakespeare was the main mc of the elizabethan scene and so i figure to be or not to be similar to how you be be as timeless as hell and as universal since such questions never go out of style i only wish othello had sussed out iago and taken iago down to the crossroads and asked iago the devil ’ s true-true name juliet is like lady gaga in my hbo rewrite and romeo lives in harlem with his moms — though that ’ s only his nom-de-plume he wants to be the first rapper with a phd and robert burns smiles to keep from crying and when he penned the best-made plans of mice and men not rats often go astray what he really meant was shit happens dead old white men they knew the blues though they didn ’ t always know what they knew okay maybe not even in 1619 by which time shakespeare was auld lang syne and burns was not yet in this world but the blues isn ’ t stuck on color or cp time
i early morning the rain gray god with its huge hands has shredded the roses and clapping kept us up all night the bridge washed out the troll waiting to gobble a goat how long has he been there wet and cold impatient starving his coat rent with welts and matted with mist father thundering his voice full of bracken and leaves leaves that in the autumn clogged the gutters who goes over the bridge who goes there the billy goats stammering pawing the air but i am the goat and the troll and so can not pass nor grant passage ii the high meadow filled with sweet grass the spindle puts the moon to bed the window latched the sheets pulled tight pincushion star ram butting his head my brother and sister behind and ahead — his sister was no use to him either she took what was his cat ’ s cradle bridge made of sharp goat ’ s thread who goes there now over the rickety bridge tiny steps lickety-split my place is in the pause between the thunder and the bridge father shouting over the torn white water hoofprints mark the place last seen iii at the museum bellows for alexander nemerov the man in the left-hand corner of bellows ’ s picture of the dempsey-firpo fight the picture a dream so not a real fight — a picture of a fight — his flayed hide just visible under his blue pinstripes the watcher and the fighter indistinguishable one inside the other lion and lion tamer the paint daubs faces or fingerprints and the lights staring and staring across the fretwork of the ring and bellows himself next to him looking surprised as if to be there was to give himself up without our noticing it as we all do in a gesture or word leaving something behind we should have taken with us or even guarded a way of not letting something be over and done with the fight was over in four minutes flat a curious thing about the painting is that bellows chose to show us the moment when firpo sent dempsey careening with a blow to the jaw one of the two times he laid him out and we with the spectators crammed into the foreground of the picture have to help push dempsey back into the ring where two-and-a-half minutes later he will defeat firpo who went down four times to his two in assisi at the basilica di san francesco in the panel in which giotto depicts the moment francis gives away his worldly goods the palm that francis raises up to the hand that is reaching down to him from heaven a hand out of the blue open ready to give or receive wonders is the same hand in bellows ’ s picture raised behind dempsey one wing of a dove the impulse is to press our own palms to it and despite our better judgment to hurl him back iv blackbirds a song that father liked to sing a dozen blackbirds baked alive but still alive when they did bring the pie to set before the king — what a flurry when the pie was cut the birds cawed madly as they rose — blackbirds flapping blackened wings who circled back to snip your nose i see the moon the moon sees me shining on the apple tree ... don ’ t sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me — no no with anyone else but me ... sound of hurry over the bridge v at the museum wyeth as always we want something from the dead even the blackbird stiff in a kind of grassy net its black leather gangster feet curled up as if holding on to something it let go — and beyond to the right inevitably a house — black-shuttered with its high gray wing its bones buried deep in the earth like a beast that once took flight bones with the imprint of feathers that print repeated in the far away trees on a rise to the left of the house a good distance away as if the trees had been painted by pressing a painted leaf to the canvas the spine the tablature of a feather or fish the scales clearly marked in miniature although we know the trees are much bigger than the blackbird so stock-still in the spiky grass so lately landed its glossy mourning coat spit-shined under those trees a short distance from the house as nowhere else in the picture a moment of repose the sun on the warm bark the circle of cool beneath but the bird holds us fast a shadow cast by moonlight the flowers beside it articulate as the delphiniums in la primavera at the uffizi at which we paused until we could look no longer at an extreme propensity for beauty as though it might explode in smithereens autumn the seed pods are moth-eaten moons dry rattling in wyeth ’ s more famous picture the girl stranded in the foreground in a clutch of weeds her awkward limbs stretching in the hissing grass is in the same place in the picture plane as the blackbird we all agreed with this the woman in the white hat — why a hat inside the museum — and her friend smaller dressed all in black black shoes black stockings black dress although it is summer at once we want to help her as she reaches the unbridgeable distance of the field and the meadow filled with rough grass although it ’ s not so evident how to help her for even now our heavy limbs twitch with enchantment caught in a dream in which it is impossible to move except by slithering in my sleep you said i said — too many people the black house is a ship on the horizon every light on or the moon that looks as if it is following us but from which we are always veering away the white wolf snapping at our heels goading us to cross the bridge or waiting for us by the water its white face wavering under the pilings the girl is a blackbird in the high grass it is natural to mistake one for the other when it is so difficult despite the painter ’ s efforts herculean really to see clearly — vi saturday night at the ballet puck above a game of flashlight tag the tiniest fairy pirouetting like a dervish — the honeysuckle wood alit one pointed green-shod foot dangling like the hand that reached down to francis to pull him up to heaven or rebuke him or the white hand coming out of the darkness over the ring counting one two three alley alley innisfree — the three goats balking at the bridge father bellowing over the rushing water the river loud rearing its head foam rushing past its eyes and ears father clamoring needing something — the moment we know it has come to nothing vii the dream the heavens shift and presto the tilted abacus of stars slides back in place twilight ’ s worn edge rubbed to a sheen queen ass indian child love-lit quartet slipping as the constellations do behind gaia ’ s unearthly tilt leaving us in night ’ s cooler less demanding air where our taxi driver has his phone on speaker twenty minutes of harangue a hornet trapped inside a troika the driver silent except once to say interrupting the ceaseless string of epithets “ you are the women of my dreams. ” lights turn from red to green the avenue slick before the curb remember the crescent moon scar on my knee — rain patters the windshield the lights from the bodega spatter lime and pink a folded scene above the moon — another night before a halt viii evening and morning morning lit by evening ’ s lantern the cat a baby falling from the broken bough childhood ’ s terrible litter of fear i am the goat and the goat is me i see the moon the moon sees me and if i die before i wake the spirit leaving the body as we sleep as giacomo said in the gospel — who said it where if the spirit leaves my body where does it go — and in the dark the pine knots watching and your eyes big in the dark and the sound of breathing in your sleep you said too many people i woke you in the dark and i took you by the hand — how far is the moon if i folded this piece of paper but then you would never get there remember and your total disregard of me — twilight ’ s rainbow a lasso fetching the moon from the water — when i was walking i fell from the curb you did not i did i did ix the cove the three children not far off cross the road to the water and into the hot high grass their feet light on the flattened stalks of the cattails that line the swale like pale raffia woven expressly for that purpose as if the landscape was a diorama made of glassine straw and folded paper whose children are they — one two three walking to the ruined silvery splintery boat that looks like a whale come ashore in the pocket cove which opens at high tide like a giantess ’ s compact there is another smaller shadow pulling a kite — or no a pull-toy dog which barks at an upturned horseshoe crab and a stained eyeless gray-brown gull how oddly sound travels over water underfoot the sun-crazed hermit crabs run helter-skelter to their bomb shelters under the wet sand where at dead low tide the marsh makes a kind of long humped bridge of itself to the rapt cove and the ruined quiet psst says the wind the children run at it lowing their heads making horns with their fingers bashing themselves in it and through it x case sensitive two days i ’ ve forgotten where i ’ m going new york ’ s crossword up and down a litter of numbers and letters i spin on the grid round hole in a square peg each step a rope bridge hung in air my tongue a troll who eats my words my goat-fur cloak held fast by pysche ’ s brooch “ smile libling you have your whole life ahead of you. ” hold on tight even the dead won ’ t speak to me my sharp hooves beating the bank ’ s slick grass the bog oak ’ s muddy rune bee disheveled on the stairs the storm rattling the panes “ i dreamed i walked and walked and could not find my way. ” dear god let me keep my dreams to myself and do no harm
