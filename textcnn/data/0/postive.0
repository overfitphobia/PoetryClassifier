this morning i felt my life if you were dead the expansiveness of the bed the birds still singing the remnants of the smell of coffee in the morning the emptiness of thought the deafening silence of my heart
for marilyn who died in january april 1 found on our driveway like a feather dropped by a crow 8 of spades a playing card we played crazy eights slapping cards or holding them as if they were birds that might fly out of our hands decades ago in our childhood like the translucent whirling image i imagine prismatic and phosphorescent — a murmuration of starlings swooping and iridescent but it dissolved onto a gray wall undecorated glimpses of us wearing our velvet sunday best dresses yours usually crimson mine blue we never had nice shoes now you have returned to water thanks to the neptune society spreading your ashes over the pacific april 2 ceylon tea — that amber cup from sri lanka popularly known here before americans became tea drinkers as orange pekoe our mother hated so many things — tea was rattlesnake venom to her i embraced it /// what did you drink marilyn i saw you only with a coke or a glass of wine in your hand our mother whom you felt damaged you your life spirals the twisting iridescent birds fly at me now scintillating spinning i blink our mother drank many cups of coffee with cream a day our sad mother i blink and tell it to go back to our childhood of muddy little shoes from walking in the spider-filled orange groves there the damaging must have begun she loving me so much more than you i wish there had been more stories like the one about the origin of her disliking tea at 17 she went to celebrate being made teacher of the one-room school she had attended and graduated from at her retiring teacher ’ s home she was served for the first time — tea she being from a german coffee-drinking family our mother hated it but politely choked it down would never again touch a drop of the poisonous beverage from that story we learned that our mother ritualized hating something — expected us to admire her for it i took that negative pattern and spun it until i could have cloth enough for an eloquent garment perhaps the lesson simply made you feel yourself helpless ragged torn i never saw you that way marilyn though perhaps incomplete i pour a cup of assam take a sip let it wash through my mouth down my age-damaged throat think of you sitting with me in your southern california backyard one may morning next to the camellia bush i as always with a cup of tea in my hand you smoking i left all my family — you were part of it — left california and reinvented myself even mythologized myself as a tan “ california girl. ” you did not become an artist or a poet i suppose that ’ s why you felt damaged if only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice it took for me to get away so many small things can save us from the damage you talked of for me drinking that first cup of orange pekoe and making tea my drink risking rattlesnake poison with every steaming cup a tiny emblem of a rebellion i still try to practice you left us so quickly marilyn and without any warning this january your house full of cancelled aspirations — glass bowls and cylinders and huge globes filled with sea scallop shells you combed the california seashores to find collecting these empty shells washed free of their biological life out of the ocean we two different daughters of a sailor april 3 the spinning the scissors the measuring and thus our lives are given out from the heavens with unfair allotments and varied unaccountable fates born when we are and to whom you would have prevailed in an age where women had to spin weave the material cut it into britches and dresses undergarments and sheets sew and keep clean warm and comfortable a household full or a castle full men children hired hands maidservants — you would have done it so well but you would have died young in such a world — diabetes asthma chronic bronchial infections even in the 21st century where you lived to be 76 a world where all your skills were plied as substitute for being an artist when i asked you a year ago not knowing that you would die this january what you would most like to have if money were not the object — since clearly all your measuring cutting and sewing had been for economical reasons not art — you thought for a bit raising your chin “ a swimming pool in my backyard one i could step into every morning swim float — maybe in the afternoon i ’ d go for a dip many evenings i think ” she said to me longing for some ocean in our portrait if someone paints it she will be sitting in a scallop shell her many jars of seashells behind her head i will be invisible except for the spinning murmuration of birds that radiates past me they read at her funeral a poem from her journal about lying on the beach the sand embracing her how much she loved it felt safe felt released oh marilyn all those seashells emptied of their living fleshy occupants the ugly parts that die and rot now glorious empty rooms in which to live an imaginary life to decorate to create beauty spaces to live a different life what is left but your desires locked in glass and an image of you walking your beloved beaches hands full of seashells your footprints measured then quickly filled with the tidal flow april 4 my spinning a whirlpool of faceted moving lights everything is numbers down into a vortical glare that replaces my own mind ’ s desire everything is numbers everything is numbers floating down like the crow ’ s onyx feather the 8 of spades random card appearing last week over gravel 8 legs on a spider the arachnid so many people seem to fear yet i lose track of time stare into the wall or any space to replace real images with my imaginary ones some random spider who spins my fate crazy eights the child card game marilyn and i played pieces of eight the dollar of pirate spain — our childhood in orange county 8 a vertical infinity sign everything is numbers your fire opal that daddy brought to you from india and our mother paid a jeweler to set it into a ring you wore the ring more than sixty years i suppose it was on your finger at death spinning spinning to scintillate and iridesce we never had nice shoes april 5 easter sunday you and i always dyed easter eggs together our mother busy at her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper ’ s job i was intrigued with the colors but they never turned out so bright when coloring the eggs you the artist were interested in the designs to transfer onto the eggs cartoons bunnies chicks we kept our eggs separated from each other put them in separate bowls neither caring for the other ’ s creation still we felt connected even joyful on those few holiday projects not enough to make us friends my unwillingness to be like our classmates embarrassed you you chose invisibility in school rather than being known as “ diane ’ s sister. ” that unwillingness to be like others was what made me a poet so many little things but that early decision of yours not to understand why i wanted to be weird is what made you make so many other small choices preventing you from becoming an artist “ look away ” our mother said to us when there were ugly things confronting us i could not do that you blame our mother yet it was you who decided to look away even though it meant not seeing the whole world even if meant you didn ’ t become an artist poverty of course was the reason we never had nice shoes april 6 all numbers have disappeared instead there are mushrooms fungi that has always seemed more artful than tasty sipping a cup of tea soothes me as the mushrooms in a veloute sauce never could i feel stymied a rider with no horse i want only to watch the stories unfold the secret stories about why you chose to marry and have children why i did not the stories i try to banish blot out replace with the diamond dog a murmuration of iridescent starlings and the spider of eight twirling on its silk line projecting infinity art is made when you subject yourself to the unacceptable then dredge yourself out find a mineral replacement infinity iridescer irised feather scintillater a crystalline body whirls releasing me from the history the stories it ’ s so hard to tell until recent years my sister and i either ignored or disliked each other we fought continuously as children i have in my wrist a black bump that protrudes near a vein it ’ s the point of a pencil that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled for the long yellow weapon a pencil the weapon of a writer but there was no bleeding no seeming-wound to be dressed we never told our mother both too ashamed of our brutality i ’ ve never asked a doctor about it the pencil lead encapsulated in my wrist nor ever spoken of it to anyone i always wonder that so much must remain a secret why we never had nice shoes april 7 young marilyn old marilyn there are places on this planet where i find it hard to detect any beauty therefore silence no nice shoes april 8 there is silence april 9 drinking a blend of traditional darjeeling with a touch of ceylon this tea takes me back to a viennese visit drinking this very tea in the afternoon while my friend jonathan ate their famous sacher torte the tea seemed particularly aromatic — “ lightly scented with oil of bergamot and a hint of genuine bourbon vanilla. ” wishing for the moment in the past to reappear i didn ’ t know the tea from the sacher hotel was as famous as the cake until i found in my upton tea catalogue a listing for “ scented darjeeling ” under the heading “ earl grey blends ” this tea any cup of tea hard to believe no sad to think my mother almost spat out her first taste of tea what worldly thing must i touch to bring marilyn back into my sedate life my sister marilyn who died in january her hand — i ’ d like to imagine timidly touching her hand — marilyn ’ s hand her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring in that hand she ’ d be holding a cigarette smoke and fire makes me think of her — not water though it was that pacific ocean filled with seashells that she was in touch with my old hands not really like hers at all she had big hands for shaping things while mine are small like birds

anyone who begins a sentence with “ in all honesty ... ” is about to tell a lie anyone who says “ this is how i feel ” had better love form more than disclosure same for anyone who thinks he thinks well because he had a thought if you say “ you ’ re ugly ” to an ugly person — no credit for honesty which must always be a discovery an act that qualifies as an achievement if you persist you ’ re just a cruel bastard a pig without a mirror somebody who hasn ’ t examined himself enough a hesitation hints at an attempt to be honest suggests a difficulty is present a good sentence needs a clause or two interruptions set off by commas evidence of a slowing down a rethinking before i asked my wife to marry me i told her i ’ d never be fully honest no one she said had ever said that to her i was trying to be radically honest i said but in fact had another motive a claim without a “ but ” in it is at best only half true in all honesty i was asking in advance to be forgiven

the first act of love in a new house is not private loving each other we are half-aware of door and mirror our ecstasy includes the bedside chair the air from the landing street-lamp and elm utter leaves on walls as in no room ever theirs is the tongue our tongues join in translating their message is clear tonight you can not ignore the world at the window so we love in the knowledge of a city at a different angle and sharing our bed with furniture and tree we claim their perspective merging our lives here in their established frame

once again someone falls in their first falling–fall of two bodies of two eyes of four green eyes or eight green eyes if we count those born in the mirror at midnight in the purest fear in the loss you haven ’ t been able to recognize the voice of your dull silence to see the earthly messages scrawled in the middle of one mad state when the body is a glass and from ourselves and from the other we drink some kind of impossible water desire needlessly spills on me a cursed liqueur for my thirsty thirst what can the promise of eyes do i speak of something not in this world i speak of someone whose purpose is elsewhere and i was naked in memory of the white night drunk and i made love all night just like a sick dog sometimes we suffer too much reality in the space of a single night we get undressed we ’ re horrified we ’ re aware the mirror sounds like a watch the mirror from which your cry will pour out your laceration night opens itself only once it ’ s enough you see you ’ ve seen fear of being two in the mirror and suddenly we ’ re four we cry we moan my fear my joy more horrible than my fear my visceral words my words are keys that lock me into a mirror with you but ever alone and i am well aware what night is made of we ’ ve fallen so completely into jaws that didn ’ t expect this sacrifice this condemnation of my eyes which have seen i speak of a discovery felt the i in sex sex in the i. i speak of burying everyday fear to secure the fear of an instant the purest loss but who ’ ll say you don ’ t cry anymore at night because madness is also a lie like night like death

a slobbery insistence when we were retching with so much desire we created a whole new atmosphere grabbing at sex things using the sick bag to be actually sick in now the shower curtain is transparent it ’ s a way of saying “ i want you too to have this experience so that we are more alike like a sign that life struck once in a slippy-bits marathon that began when our eyes were magnets yanked to

even the trees had to dash inside to pour ice in their underpants ” while i choked up playing the scene as we lived it united by our pursuit of arrhythmia or satisfying itches to that catchy bridge section in chopin i couldn ’ t wait to come with chopin through his melancholic meadow not that i approve of background music i prefer to foreground the piano by massaging it loud and all over until the top layer comes off in my hand and the pedal squeaks for humanity i like to feel a piano as an instrument of interruption and consciousness though i also like to take light swims to get away from what i feel today i felt jelly beans resemble kidneys which throbs like everyone grieving 7 here have a new puppy said the russians to the french to soften the dog-loss but mostly the dog ’ s image the image is the greater likeness except we never seem to run out of images sometimes something in an image runs through me and that is very common as is reading about something that ’ s happening to someone outside of me until i know someone outside of me without any knowledge it is a test for my knowledge to hang around until morning practically all mornings are news to me practically all knowledge is news to me practically all news is images going very fast around the world so we have to guzzle them like wrapped food — hot and on the run — in one end and squitted out the other pics or it didn ’ t happen until i ’ m fat with implications and containing not a sausage 9 i love a good weepy dog-meme as much as the next crybaby and nauseate irregularly when the gifs load automatically his hairy body into my hairy body unfairly the dog becomes the shape of 2:13 p.m. in me on a tuesday if we accept the world as totally fucked there ’ s a lot worse coming than dog hairs in macaroni cheese dog hairs on pillows dog hairs in rented flats in bathtubs in my hair in my dog ’ s hair in your short curlies between my teeth in coagulant soap bars some people are revolted by dogs and dogs are not up for revolting i am revolted when dogs are lacking what if he did lick my cheeks by which i mean “ buttocks ” which were coated in whipped shea butter and heavily comestible it ’ s obvious he ’ s related to a father he never knew because we found all his needs and perverted them into a kind of inter-species loyalty or the usual master-slave hierarchy before laying down the crisp breakfast bowl of the rest of his days which gave us carte blanche to rush in anytime and smother him with kisses without getting socked in the eye unlike when i tried the same on johnny who spat my tongue out no one blamed him when maybe all he wants is just to go on being less and less subtle and alive the way life becomes very well known after its termination 12 if rigor mortis sets in it means there ’ s somebody who needs it it means that somebody is drained and not awake and deems any speckles of life unusable and he is dead and dead all dead in the humus of trashed bodies shoved down there dressed in made-up relationships what ’ s your favorite part mine ’ s every part with a maggot in it maggots mean that life ’ s still leaking it ’ s like magic when his dead voice is nauseating and i can ’ t see him so he might as well be invisible it ’ s like magic when he isn ’ t and doesn ’ t have anything to say and i can ’ t bear to listen anyway so i just recognize my fingers all the injuries they ’ ve inflicted while my skin drops off what ’ s worse than a maggot in the eat me glove-box dates does the 5-second rule apply to something that drops dead is it true he might come back and crack open a piñata blue alcopops bombay mix karaoke and a pint of nostalgia which is like thinking in another language i mean how it feels not what it means half a maggot the memory of mange marching across his fur describes a lot of other feelings the feeling that someone else is taking up the whole room the feeling that no one could help me now or ever whether i was on several edges my hot core and noggin facing this hammering world of brainlessness and sweetbreads was always a favorite word i don ’ t know what it tastes like but i know it ’ s terrible a ldskjfa lkdgjsa meaning i ’ m so overcharged that all i can do is literally slam my hands head breasts against the keyboard wherever there are corpses there are maggots if we dig him up will he be wearing a jacket look out for the milkier gentler solaces which for all we know for all we know could be the wind or chopin ’ s noise still hammering the background — who ’ s seen it only its aftermath is visible what ’ s not visible is the aftermath of my screaming 20 you can catch me on the floor dog syringe periphery of the dying and dead scene face female maybe my whole life carting sensations to the center mopping shit up with towels skull coffin there are feelings for these things while public petting car plane rocket bodies leak it ’ s no surprise what i give away one droplet you can have when the vet twirls off to deal with some bloody business in a kitchen knife gun the hug-a-corpse scene gets deep in the hold of what i am party popper wastebin is what i ’ ve not yet been 30 who concocts the smell of dogs which smells like an extreme close-up of the world oozing in at the edges full as an ice cube is full of liquid i mistook it for solidity the world is too full of smells though it ’ s impossible to see the top of it they crawl between my legs in the shimmering fuzz on top of the plant stickers of evenings tongues held out pocket-friendly air fresheners strikes on our

while he lives here ’ s a list of images light in a filthy glass pigeon dead on the high spiked window clear plastic bag above him full of water if water could kill everything that lives in you it can — i sit in a corner of the cancer ward fingering the app that shows me other faggots in this hospital chat with one i might meet in radiology but don ’ t instead make the sick man laugh while he ’ s conscious compliment his gown his new brutal cheekbones that appeared with the chemo if only it were simple as a magnet sucking the bad metals out of him if only i could make a better list more magic less language periphrastic restorative if only i met that stranger in the basement our pleasure rose through the hospital bliss poultice for the sorrow-skinned who sit half-conscious half-machinery while the sick man lives all i can do is recount the vast pastoral of his illness when he is gone i ’ m counting on all the good flooding back his beard a collapsed country i ’ ll refuge inside his laugh a memory so liquid i ’ ll hear it when anyone opens a window to scare the birds

after she left the first thing ahmad jamal played was a bridge he fingered water falling over a cantilever made a dark blue truth transparent i try to suspend belief across a span of hand- written notes at noon i cross myself over a painted bridge in pittsburgh sauntering from station square to smithfield st haunted by a smell along the monongahela these streets cobble stone memories work overtime in my olfactories once my piano-playing girlfriend fingered daisies waving in a breeze then in love with her noes i began sniffing everything but the florid truth is that i gave her a ring of rust on her windowsill a heart broken like a line in a poem my girl left me ahmad jamal was playing “ wave ” on my ipod it ’ s probably not smart to admit this but what he didn ’ t play came across loudest i only saw her hands say goodbye because of the beauty in my earbuds then i nosed a wine- bottle blue scarf she ’ d left on the right arm of a chair be honest would you have sniffed it what song doesn ’ t long for the long fingers of a pianist a cantilever here only holds up meaning i smelled farewell in a coffee shop as she high-heeled east sunlight buttered loafing pedestrians shadowed crossing things as i wondered whether jamal ’ s main fault was living too long and weathering if his main technique was to cleave themes or to refrain as he plays the heart gives out a rapid repeat a piano bench pines to be dusted with notes can it buckle up such wont maybe there are facets of bridges one will always truss something phonic and unforgettable about how they allow us to cross a wave of daisies in a vase — how they ravel aromatic in the mind ahmad jamal waving across the room me damned roiling underneath like a river maybe i dreamt this but when i licked my fingertips to turn the page they became daisies pushing between bricks on a twilit bridge

last night i went to a gay bar with a man i love a little after dinner we had a drink we sat in the far-back of the big backyard and he asked what will we do when this place closes i do n't think it 's going anywhere any time soon i said though the crowd was slow for a saturday and he said—yes but one day where will we go he walked me the half-block home and kissed me goodnight on my stoop— properly not too quick close enough our stomachs pressed together in a second sort of kiss i live next to a bar that 's not a gay bar —we just call those bars i guess— and because it is popular and because i live on a busy street there are always people who are n't queer people on the sidewalk on weekend nights just people i guess they were there last night as i kissed this man i was aware of them watching and of myself wondering whether or not they were just but i did n't let myself feel scared i kissed him exactly as i wanted to as i would have without an audience because i decided many years ago to refuse this fear— an act of resistance i left the idea of hate out on the stoop and went inside to sleep early and drunk and happy while i slept a man went to a gay club with two guns and killed forty-nine people today in an interview his father said he had been disturbed recently by the sight of two men kissing what a strange power to be cursed with for the proof of men 's desire to move men to violence what 's a single kiss i 've had kisses no one has ever known about so many kisses without consequence— but there is a place you ca n't outrun whoever you are there will be a time when it might be a bullet suddenly the sound of it many one man two guns fifty dead— two men kissing last night i ca n't get away from imagining it them the people there to dance and laugh and drink who did n't believe they 'd die who could n't have how else can you have a good time how else can you live there must have been two men kissing for the first time last night and for the last and two women too and two people who were neither brown people which can not be a coincidence in this country which is a racist country which is gun country today i 'm thinking of the bernie boston photograph flower power of the vietnam protestor placing carnations in the rifles of the national guard and wishing for a gesture as queer and simple the protester in the photo was gay you know he went by hibiscus and died of aids which i am also thinking about today because the government 's response to aids was a hate crime now we have a president who names us the big and imperfectly lettered us and here we are getting kissed on stoops getting married some of us some of us getting killed we must love one another whether or not we die love ca n't block a bullet but neither can it be shot down and love is for the most part what makes us— in orlando and in brooklyn and in kabul we will be everywhere always there 's nowhere else for us or you to go anywhere you run in this world love will be there to greet you around any corner there might be two men kissing
ten below high of zero 4:11 pm flashed the alarm panel ’ s handsome blue touchscreen without commotion or fire the afternoon passed slowly full of promise then disappointment without heartbreak or break-in for company i had kafka on my lap and qolsys vibrating lightly against the wall 4:34 ... 4:35 ... there are all sorts of creatures in the world i read wretched limited dumb creatures who have no language but mechanical cries i stood up and stretched face-to-face with qolsys i peered into the sensors into the little hole of the siren and touched up my lipstick maybe i can ask dave to come back i thought dave from royal security dave with the smoky brown eyes maybe he can help i took off my slippers my bargain-basement bra and danced silence not even a mechanical cry — i wondered if the fault were mine maybe i miswired the hard data the soft data maybe the poor thing simply had no loins i opened the window window opening said qolsys in a low persuasive voice outside there were heavy birds weighing down the winter trees heaps of them in the gloaming almost purple waiting for what who can say i shut the window window closing said qolsys it was a start not so very different from others of my species narrating events as they happen i ’ m coming i ’ m coming — i opened the window again letting the cold air press across my wrists the back of my neck my lips hoping at least the motion detector inside or the birds outside would respond to the scent that pulsed there you will not go unsampled i heard the birds say be mine i heard the trees say i could have turned down the sound i could have shut the window but like a darkness slowly advancing like winter lightning we are drawn together
no woman wants to be low-hanging fruit my glamorous girlfriend says but i ’ m indiscriminate and love all fruit i ’ m tempted to list each kind right here in and out of season because even just saying the names gives me pleasure as does saying your name i ’ m not alone with my passion — my whole family we ’ re a little off in this regard we can spend hours talking about cantaloupe or arguing over how many flats to buy when it ’ s peach-o-rama at the metropolitan once i even drove half a day to get to pence orchards where i met and took photos of bert pence who sold me three boxes of peaches at wholesale prices he was so good to me as was the late-summer freestone i picked as i walked back through the orchard in the august heat to the entrance gates which were nothing like the gates of hell on the contrary i was in heaven there in yakima i can still smell that single peach which was profusely low-hanging it was the definition of low-hanging it fell into my hands as you did — or perhaps as i did into yours — but that was months ago when i walked past the stands yesterday on what should have been the first day of spring all produce had been covered with heavy blankets to keep it warm to mitigate harm today the temperature dropped so low someone thought to remove the fruit entirely and stash it away with this strange weather we ’ re having will i see you again i can ’ t help myself
fish tap tap tap on the roof water rushes by through the living room and into the kitchen late night and look someone thought to do the dishes a lamp is on in the other room two lamps lampreys swirl

when he speaks of deserved and undeserved as more than terms — how they can matter suddenly — i can tell he believes it sometimes a thing can seem star-like when it ’ s just a star stripped of whatever small form of joy likeness equals sometimes the thought that i ’ m doomed to fail — that the body is — keeps me almost steady if steadiness is what a gift for a while brings — feathers burst- at-last pods of milkweed october — before it all fades away before the drugs and the loud music before tears and restraining orders and the eventual go fuck yourself get your ass out of here don ’ t go the apartments across the street were a boys ’ grammar school — before that a convent the only remains of which ornamenting the far parking lot is a marble pedestal with some latin on it that translates as heart of jesus have mercy as if that much at least still remained relevant or should if it ’ s true that secrets resist always the act of telling how come secrets more often than not seem the entire story caladium cleome — how delicate this holding of certain words in the mouth the all but lost trick of lifting for salvage the last windfalls as across them the bees make their slow-muscled stunned moving scab ...

about what ’ s past hold on when you can i used to say and when you can ’ t let go as if memory were one of those mechanical bulls easily dismountable should the ride turn rough i lived in those days at the forest ’ s edge — metaphorically so it can sometimes seem now though the forest was real as my life beside it was i spent much of my time listening to the sounds of random un- knowable things dropping or being dropped from variously a middling height or a great one until by winter it was just the snow falling each time like a new unnecessary taxonomy or syntax for how to parse what ’ s plain snow from which the occasional lost hunter would emerge every few or so seasons and — just once — a runaway child whom i gave some money to and told no one about having promised ... you must keep what you ’ ve promised very close to your heart that way you ’ ll never forget is what i ’ ve always been told i ’ ve been told quite a lot of things they hover — some more unbidden than others — in that part of the mind where mistakes and torn wishes echo as in a room that ’ s been newly cathedraled so that the echo surprises though lately it ’ s less the echo itself that can still most surprise me about memory — it ’ s more the time it takes going away a mouth opening to say i love sex with you too it doesn ’ t mean i wan na stop my life for it for example or just a voice mouthless asking since when does the indifference of the body ’ s stance when we ’ re alone unwatched in late light amount to cruelty for the metaphysical poets the problem with weeping for what ’ s been lost is that tears wash out memory and by extension what we ’ d hoped to remember if i refuse increasingly to explain isn ’ t explanation at the end of the day what the sturdier truths most resist it ’ s been my experience that tears are useless against all the rest of it that if i could i ’ d forget that i keep wanting to stay should count at least for something i ’ m not done with you yet

i think first of two sparrows i met when walking home late night years ago in another city not unlike this — the one bird frantic attacking i thought the way she swooped down circled my head and flailed her wings in my face how she seemed to scream each time i swung how she dashed back and forth between me and a blood-red corolla parked near the opposite curb how finally i understood i spied another bird also calling its foot inexplicably caught in the car ’ s closed door beating its whole bird body against it trying it appeared to bang himself free and who knows how long he ’ d been there wailing who knows — he and the other i mistook at first for a bat they called to me — something between squawk and chirp something between song and prayer — to do something anything and like any good god i disappeared not indifferent exactly but with things to do and most likely on my way home from another heartbreak call it 1997 and say i ’ m several thousand miles from home by which i mean those were the days i made of everyone a love song by which i mean i was lonely and unrequited but that ’ s not quite it either truth is i did manage to find a few to love me but couldn ’ t always love them back the rasta law professor the firefighter ’ s wife the burlesque dancer whose daughter blackened drawings with ms to mean the sky was full of birds the day her daddy died i think his widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip anyway i ’ m digressing but if you asked that night — did i mention it was night — why i didn ’ t even try to jimmy the lock to spring the sparrow i couldn ’ t say truthfully that it had anything to do with envy with wanting a woman to plead as deeply for me as these sparrows did one for the other no i ’ d have said something instead about the neighborhood itself the car thief shot a block and a half east the week before or about the men i came across nights prior sweat-slicked and shirtless grappling in the middle of the street the larger one ’ s chest pressed to the back of the smaller bruised and bleeding both i know you thought this was about birds but stay with me i left them both in the street — the same street where i ’ d leave the sparrows — the men embracing and for all one knows especially one not from around there they could have been lovers — the one whispering an old old tune into the ear of the other — baby baby don ’ t leave me this way i left the men where i ’ d leave the sparrows and their song and as i walked away i heard one of the men call to me please or help or brother or some such and i didn ’ t break stride not one bit it ’ s how i ’ ve learned to save myself let me try this another way call it 1977. and say i ’ m back west south central los angeles my mother and father at it again but this time in the street broad daylight and all the neighbors watching one i think his name was sonny runs out from his duplex to pull my father off you see where i ’ m going with this my mother crying out fragile as a sparrow sonny fighting my father fragile as a sparrow and me years later trying to get it all down as much for you — i ’ m saying — as for me sonny catches a left lies flat on his back blood starting to pool and his own wife wailing my mother wailing and traffic backed now half a block horns whistles and soon sirens 1977. summer and all the trees full of birds hundreds i swear and since i ’ m the one writing it i ’ ll tell you they were crying which brings me back to dolphy and his transcribing the jazzman i think wanted only to get it down pure to get it down exact — the animal racking itself against a car ’ s steel door the animals in the trees reporting the animals we make of ourselves and one another stay with me now don ’ t leave me days after the dustup my parents took me to the park and in this park was a pond and in this pond were birds not sparrows but swans and my father spread a blanket and brought from a basket some apples and a paring knife summertime my mother wore sunglasses and long sleeves my father now sober cursed himself for leaving the radio but my mother forgave him and said as she caressed the back of his hand that we could just listen to the swans and we listened and i watched two birds coupling one beating its wings as it mounted the other summer 1977. i listened and watched when my parents made love late into that night i covered my ears in the next room scanning the encyclopedia for swans it meant nothing to me — then at least — but did you know the collective noun for swans is a lamentation and is a lamentation not its own species of song what a woman wails punch drunk in the street or what a widow might sing learning her man was drowned by swans a lamentation of them imagine the capsized boat the panicked man struck about the eyes nose and mouth each time he comes up for air imagine the birds coasting away and the waters suddenly calm either trumpet swans or mutes the dead man ’ s wife running for help crying to any who ’ d listen a lamentation and a city busy saving itself i ’ m digressing sure but did you know that to digress means to stray from the flock when i left my parents ’ house i never looked back by which i mean i made like a god and disappeared as when i left the sparrows and the copulating swans as when someday i ’ ll leave this city its every flailing its every animal song
now that the theoretical physicist slash cosmologist has explained to me has laid out in clean even rows of logic how every atom in my body arrived from a star a star that blasted apart and the atoms of my left hand originated from a different sun than my right i can shine i can go dark recalling how my grandfather made the vertical blinds rattle when he shoved my grandmother into them startled in the yard i turned to that sound from the flower bed my eyes were held by the swaying blinds it took a while for each to line up perfectly straight again to tell myself she slipped only then could i return to stalking the butterflies my right hand was quick reach and pinch i had so many soft wings that summer between my thumb and index so many of them skewered on cactus needles i was a kid i was cruel slash gentle he was cruel slash gentle he had witnessed my destroying and i saw across his creased face empathy for them after his scolding i placed one dead one inside the white envelope of a flower under the sun it glowed under the moon more glowing
no one wants another paean to a rosy dawn so it 's good this one 's bluish baby-shade at the horizon bleeding up into midnight like a botched dye job and having enough of the old world—larks crakes nightingales storks—this space is populated by one fly crabbing across a notebook page he seems like me honey-slowed by winter 's shortest days clumsy and isolated my love bought a black-and-white photo once close-up of a birch trunk fly crawling up the curled paper bark marring the purity of the image you do n't notice the fly until you do and then you ca n't stop no one wants a fly in art but there it is elegantly framed and we 're over the epic so here first thing this morning a pedestrian quarrel years ago i flew across a mountain range in black coat and black boots to secretly meet him in the city how many dawns did it take to arrive at this particular at 9:30 the sky flares not like flame—a paper fan you buy in chinatown for a dollar a sudden breeze sways the tibetan flags strung along the eaves i never noticed how thin the fabric you can see right through the printed prayers to the thermometer— five degrees—and beyond birches leaning all to windward sun bleaches out the last mysterious now we pray to the real —11.29.2012
“ if god is art then what do we make of jasper johns ” one never knows what sort of question a patient will pose or how exactly one should answer outside the window snow on snow began to answer the ground below with nothing more than foolish questions we were no different i asked again “ professor have we eased the pain ” eventually he ’ d answer me with “ tell me young man whom do you love ” “ e '' i ’ d say “ none of the above '' and laugh for lack of something more to add for days he had played that game and day after day i avoided your name by instinct i never told him how we often wear each other ’ s clothes— we aren ’ t what many presuppose call it an act of omission my love tonight while walking to the car i said your name to the evening star clearly pronouncing the syllables to see your name dissipate in the air evaporate only the night air carries your words up to the dead the ancients wrote i watched them rise become remote
i have not disappeared the boulevard is full of my steps the sky is full of my thinking an archbishop prays for my soul even though we met only once and even then he was busy waving at a congregation the ticking clocks in vermont sway back and forth as though sweeping up my eyes and my tattoos and my metaphors and what comes up are the great paragraphs of dust which also carry motes of my existence i have not disappeared my wife quivers inside a kiss my pulse was given to her many times in many countries the chunks of bread we dip in olive oil is communion with our ancestors who also have not disappeared their delicate songs i wear on my eyelids their smiles have given me freedom which is a crater i keep falling in when i bite into the two halves of an orange whose cross-section resembles my lungs a delta of juices burst down my chin and like magic makes me appear to those who think i've disappeared it 's too bad war makes people disappear like chess pieces and that prisons turn prisoners into movie endings when i fade into the mountains on a forest trail i still have not disappeared even though its green façade turns my arms and legs into branches of oak it is then i belong to a southerly wind which by now you have mistaken as me nodding back and forth like a hasid in prayer or a mother who has just lost her son to gunfire in detroit i have not disappeared in my children i see my bulging face pressing further into the mysteries in a library in tucson on a plane above buenos aires on a field where nearby burns a controlled fire i am held by a professor a general and a photographer one burns a finely wrapped cigar then sniffs the scented pages of my books scouring for the bitter smell of control i hold him in my mind like a chalice i have not disappeared i swish the amber hue of lager on my tongue and ponder the drilling rigs in the gulf of alaska and all the oil-painted plovers when we talk about limits we disappear in jasper tx you can disappear on a strip of gravel i am a life in sacred language termites toil over a grave and my mind is a ravine of yesterdays at a glance from across the room i wear september on my face which is eternal and does not disappear even if you close your eyes once and for all simultaneously like two coffins
this downpour of bad reasoning this age-old swarm this buzzing about town this kick and stomp through gardens this snag on the way to the mall this heap and toss of fabric and strewn shoes this tangled beauty this i came here not knowing here to be torched this fumbling ecstasy this ecstasy of fumbling this spray of lips and fingers this scrape of bone this raid of private grounds this heaving and rocking this scream and push this sightless hunger this tattered perishing this rhythmic teeth knocking this unbearable music this motionless grip grimace and groan
it is not the chambers of the heart that hold him captive but the hallways of the mind why his image burning green and blue persists —the face the eyes questioning the shape of his head—is beyond anything i can understand what lessons must be learned to overcome the final act of longing this morning sunlight grasped at everything but the wind swept through the streets taking things with it even the soul sometimes the curtain does not completely fall and the play barely visible continues this much i know this much the textbooks have taught us the blind man cervantes built continued to see and saw far too much could not accept the utter purity of abstraction but is that not our essential fault a tree frog croaks against the backdrop of memory and the cold sheets and darkened room return but you are not here to whisper me to sleep the ocean ’ s long-windedness offers no replacement for your voice anxious the way it could be at night what is there to understand not the heart certainly not the heart that is so easily trained to forget night after night like the tree frog i remind myself who i am voicing what i can not voice during the day
my neighbor is velvety and kicks serious game so sweet garlic refuses to hang tight in his mouth he pulls women to his wide chest each time as if he 's won the lotto he rocks them gently and gentler my neighbor is a master spooner he knows not of desire but only the rules of engagement he says i miss having skype on all night so i can listen to your breathing he floats in his museum of gams drifting from frame to frame
for keith and jen friends i am here to modestly report seeing in an orchard in my town a goldfinch kissing a sunflower again and again dangling upside down by its tiny claws steadying itself by snapping open like an old-timey fan its wings again and again until swooning it tumbled off and swooped back to the very same perch where the sunflower curled its giant swirling of seeds around the bird and leaned back to admire the soft wind nudging the bird 's plumage and friends i could see the points on the flower 's stately crown soften and curl inward as it almost indiscernibly lifted the food of its body to the bird 's nuzzling mouth whose fervor i could hear from oh 20 or 30 feet away and see from the tiny hulls that sailed from their good racket which good racket i have to say was making me blush and rock up on my tippy-toes and just barely purse my lips with what i realize now was being simply glad which such love if we let it makes us feel
we buried the problem we planted a tree over the problem we regretted our actions toward the problem we declined to comment on the problem we carved a memorial to the problem dedicated it forgot our handkerchief we removed all “ unnatural ” ingredients handcrafted a locally-grown tincture for the problem but nobody bought it we freshly-laundered bleached deodorized the problem we built a wall around the problem tagged it with pictures of children birds in trees we renamed the problem and denounced those who used the old name we wrote a law for the problem but it died in committee we drove the problem out with loud noises from homemade instruments we marched leafleted sang hymns linked arms with the problem got dragged to jail got spat on by the problem and let out we elected an official who finally gets the problem we raised an army to corral and question the problem they went door to door but could never id we made www.problem.com so you can find out about the problem and www.problem.org so you can help we created 1-800-problem so you could report on the problem and 1-900-problem so you could be the only daddy that really turns that problem on we drove the wheels offa that problem we rocked the shit out of that problem we amplified the problem turned it on up and blew it out we drank to forget the problem we inhaled the problem exhaled the problem crushed its ember under our shoe we put a title on the problem took out all the articles conjunctions and verbs called it “ exprmntl prblm. ” we shot the problem and put it out of its misery we swallowed daily pills for the problem followed a problem fast drank problem tea we read daily problem horoscopes had our problem palms read by a seer we prayed burned problem incense formed a problem task force got a problem degree got on the problem tenure track got a problem retirement plan we gutted and renovated the problem we joined the neighborhood problem development corp. we listened and communicated with the problem only to find out that it had gone for the day we mutually empowered the problem we kissed and stroked the problem we fucked the problem all night woke up to an empty bed we watched carefully for the problem but our flashlight died we had dreams of the problem in which we could no longer recognize ourselves we reformed we transformed turned over a new leaf turned a corner found ourselves near a scent that somehow reminded us of the problem in ways we could never put into words that little i-can ’ t-explain-it that makes it hard to think that rings like a siren inside

i can enter the morning with traces of an eternal dream to live on a planet of women we sing in the fertile forest caress on lavender hills bathe beneath cascades of clear waters and just like that nude and wet we mount each other ’ s bodies our desire is a whale that searches for calm in the depth of the sea i smell sex in my hair when i awaken the dream perfumes all of my days i go to the post office and look for stamps with etchings of flowers and fruits so that i can send letters to the women who loved me in my sleep we are in a world that is not ours what do we do with the dreams that touch our consciousness in the nude each night our planet of women is nothing more than a dream who knows how many of us bathe in the woods or which ones of us have wings that let us fly with our flesh it ’ s not for anyone to know fortunately we always dream paradise we make it ours there we find each other and live in our collective memory and so i smell sex in my hair when i awaken
i think she wanted to explain the silence hidden within her voice— blue egg in the nettles she wrote something on a rock used the rock to bash in the skull of an injured deer bloodied swan-neck arms she slinks into her own viscera a baby fox backing into its trunkhole the wordbone 's connected to the gutbone meanwhile her desire for nobody now bucks like a rabbit under her ground
in the middle of this century we turned to each other with half faces and full eyes like an ancient egyptian picture and for a short while i stroked your hair in the opposite direction to your journey we called to each other like calling out the names of towns where nobody stops along the route lovely is the world rising early to evil lovely is the world falling asleep to sin and pity in the mingling of ourselves you and i lovely is the world the earth drinks men and their loves like wine to forget it ca n't and like the contours of the judean hills we shall never find peace in the middle of this century we turned to each other i saw your body throwing shade waiting for me the leather straps for a long journey already tightening across my chest i spoke in praise of your mortal hips you spoke in praise of my passing face i stroked your hair in the direction of your journey i touched your flesh prophet of your end i touched your hand which has never slept i touched your mouth which may yet sing dust from the desert covered the table at which we did not eat but with my finger i wrote on it the letters of your name
like our bodies imprint not a sign will remain that we were in this place the world closes behind us the sand straightens itself dates are already in view in which you no longer exist already a wind blows clouds which will not rain on us both and your name is already in the passenger lists of ships and in the registers of hotels whose names alone deaden the heart the three languages i know all the colors in which i see and dream none will help me
as the tide rises the closed mollusc opens a fraction to the ocean 's food bathed in its riches do not ask what force would do or if force could a knife is of no use against a fortress you might break it to pieces as gulls do no only the rising tide and its slow progress opens the shell lovers i tell you true you who have held yourselves closed hard against warm sun and wind shelled up in fears and hostile to a touch or tender word— the ocean rises salt as unshed tears now you are floated on this gentle flood that can not force or be forced welcome food salt as your tears the rich ocean 's blood eat rest be nourished on the tide of love
they amputated your thighs off my hips as far as i 'm concerned they are all surgeons all of them they dismantle us each from the other as far as i 'm concerned they are all engineers all of them a pity we were such a good and loving invention an aeroplane made from a man and wife wings and everything we hovered a little above the earth we even flew a little
boat me around gently whoever i 'm with i 'm seeing only you diplomacy has wounded us pierced us smashed us is there something in the turning of this river 's head that will mend our dislocations your eagle drives my ego there is ice in your thighs take the buoys of light for your thighpaths whose eyes night has darkened
inside the northern general they ’ re trying to burn away a small piece of your heart i want to know which bit how much and what it holds my questions live between what doctors call the heart and what we mean by it wide as the gap between brain and mind and in our lineage of bypassed hearts we should be grateful for the literal i know my heart is your heart — good for running not much else and later as you sit up in your borrowed bed i get the whole thing wrong call it oblation offering or sacriﬁce as if you ’ d given something up as if their tiny ﬁre was ritual and we could warm by it
here the brightest constellation is hydra the water snake named for the half-woman half-reptile whom hercules slew with the help of iolaus his charioteer imagine the sound of so many heads screaming — the long shrill bays of an angry woman times twenty — and the smell of birth of all origins that followed hydra as she rose from her fetid swamp iolaus was strategic went straight for the bowels instead of the mouth burned her center before the head when her fundament was reduced to ash only then could hydra be silenced hera enraged that hercules was able to slay the creature she had raised in order to destroy him flung the corpse of the decapitated maimed hydra into the sky lest she be forgotten hydra ’ s blood unstoppable became hot gas her screams rose and fell until they were radio waves and her wild flailing was fixed into points of radiance hera was right to hurl those stars here above this bay so close to where the earth is bisected a place where hydra ’ s mirror image glosses the water where dense blooms of algae flourish on the nitrogen surface thousands of wild heads and arms devouring ammonia cyanide and sewage as fast as we can produce them this hydra emblem of insatiable desire
mugoo was a sweeper boy and the cleanest of the sweeper caste he would leap at the blush of dawn to clean the paths and the steps spotless gugoo was a bootmaker girl who made boots gugoo was higher caste than mugoo by rights he was the floor and she was the foot that trod yet after work while the boys and girls played at tug of war wrestling or archery shy boy mugoo and shy girl gugoo would draw the boys and girls the children smiling at the shining visions would hug mugoo and gugoo then that couple would bury the drawings for fear their elders feel scandalized in manhood for mugoo and womanhood for gugoo how hard that gugoo thread boots for her father when she had no golden stitch for the gaping hole in her soul how hard that mugoo scrub the lanes who dare be swept away from the law of caste by the foul stamp and passport of besotted love yet the hairs at their ears their nipples bomped by a mere sultana breeze then the swirling night when they ’ d escape for arabia than stay near-far ... in mugoo and gugoo love was a rabbit leaping on a radish when they became runaway lovers like hares under the sketched moon they bobbed in the grunch wind before the tossed river timorous gugoo to timorous mugoo “ is it not said the pure of heart are able to turn water into solid crystal orbs ” “ i have heard it gugoo let us swim till the waters turn dot by dot into crystal orbs slowly mounting up for us a solid path so we can bobble across. ” that cub-like couple held on a first-ever daredevil cuddle then snuck a parched kiss and fell into their dive across punjab ’ s muggur of an ogre — the river ravi they were soon to learn the blunderous water was bigger than they they were dabbing onwards on the spot directionless comical pups pawdawdling ... only death was woken by their swallowed screams at the sight of a cutesome pair brinked for his maw death ’ s thin lips aah ’ d and coo ’ d to tickle himself death tipped a witching shriek in the eardrums of the ferryman charan who was rank in a dream charan swore at death “ what bastard panchod is unheroing my dream i was the river god riding the turmeric sea when the fisher king ’ s red bill fished me up a buxom masala mermaid ” death hushed charan bundled him into the boat charan still swearing fished for a scream-trail for bunny-like feet in the sudden dead-stop river ... next morning by the prophecy of the snake-priest the villagers arrived at the shame-faced riverbank charan in his guzzy saffron turban was blaring at the crowd about a passion crime huffing too had arrived the muscly cobbler and sweeper fathers all heard charan “ i am my own king of the sticks i row two weeks that way to the flowers of kashmir the gold-haired men with their bloated bags of honey and one week that way for the spices of samarkand with the red-fingered sellers of kalonji saffron jeera today i catch by the feet a fresh parable of a kutcha- pucka business i sing it for only one rupee each ” all looked down by charan ’ s sandal ’ d feet dared to be rolled in the same shivering blanket like a chapati rolled around saag paneer yet fearing to be parted yet tenuously panting were mugoo and gugoo the frail couple like shy red squirrels “ o father we love you but most we are ... loving this this that is my soul ’ s mirror mugoo is my gugoo gugoo is my mugoo. ” the bony youths clung sauced together stiffed for the glooping apart the bootmaker father been crunching his own fists the sweeper father been hurling daggers from his eyes as the crowd fell silent the fathers spoke as one “ what draws them out of caste their underhand idle drawings such fancy is inking good for nothing. ” gugoo and mugoo raised their necks “ if all hearts were good for nothing could love from each for each blow as one ” the apricot breeze blew a soft cadence but could it push the dominion of the communal mind past its bound and daily utility could sweet nothings clear the world free of blood fear of sweet-faced mugoo and gugoo in a threadbare pleading “ do not part us. ” from their mild rhetoric and politic of love the hills and valleys had swooned into blossoms of heaven and had set the scene with gaudiest cheeks so who dare part them o love be roused take arms and wound for the cause of love or at least shackle the shadows that deepened into that tinsy couple

he walks through a cloud of blue moths — one for each apostle — into a round tower with a peaked chapeau of tiles the oak door rotted wasps fierce in the vine limestone steps hollowed rows of nesting boxes dark as the eyes of city whores pigeons sleeping a wedge of sun chiseling mica through dusky air now the quiet clamor of roosting birds kept for the eggs he candles in the sacristy for the sweet meat of their breasts and dung dug into the abbé ’ s onion beds for music of a sort the crooning of forbidden sex blood bubbling from a man ’ s cut throat the boy reaches to their stink peering at novices working the pump below their creamy thighs and sleek-dipped heads their oxter hair and sideways looks soapy laughter stiff nipples wide eyes and slender hands now this back- plumage black as smeared soot iridescent necks this underwing down dense with heat and lice and suffocating dark their amber eyes stare incuriously as he kills wringing out last sobs of life lining them up neat as martyrs cut down from a cross of air
my weight is four whippets two chinese gymnasts half a shot-putter it can be measured in bags of sugar jam jars enough feathers for sixty pillows or a ﬂock of dead birds but some days it ’ s more than the house the span of blair athol road i ’ m the crooked spire warping itself doubled up over town i measure myself against the sky in its winter coat peat traces in water air locked in the radiators at night against my own held breath or your unﬁnished sentences your hand on my back like a passenger touching the dashboard when a driver brakes as if they could slow things down i measure myself against love — heavier lighter than both of us

our matchbox bedroom in the loft above your sculpture factory turns magical at times behind its dark blue druid door last night inside you sweetheart it felt as if i were coming from the soul itself and that indian summer sunday afternoon a year ago when the bed became a meadow of purple thistles the honey hidden at the bottom of the stem farm kids know to find for the sweetest suck of all and sometimes in the winter when the room turns into a cornell box filled with the everyday miracles— soap bubble pipe and thimble wooden rabbits and old tan magazine illustrations of the zodiac or turns into an igloo in which the only place to go is to burrow here below the yellow blanket and the pillows to the south pacific of ourselves and then those mornings on vacation gentle as the feathers of a light spring rain and at the same time hard like the beak of a hawk you are where i belong
death is careless at times it confuses love with a wet afternoon in an empty room the unpainted walls a reminder of how sex can resemble poverty a hollow cry an open mouth falling inside as you sleep i prepare my heart and language with better words like worlds in small selves i 've built every month one dollar buys me one brick but how many bricks does it take to build a house a stray dog barks late at night i ca n't see him but know he's there he reminds me that here dreams have dangerous turns i turn around to no one naked beside me i play it safe not to see the fire in my hands but let us be clear i 'm no beggar it 's just that there are times when the world is a sound that cripples the air and the soul when what seems arranged — glazing and strange like music played on tin cans — turns into wilting noise when suddenly all that exists is a small boy trying to focus on the pain lifting a nation a telephone call he was wearing black shoes a calvin klein t-shirt that he found in a hotel trash brown slacks she was wearing one earring on her right ear one sock on her left foot a dress the color of sky she bought him a canne à sucre he pulled her close said ti cherie and after they promised to meet later she winked and walked leisurely in the shade a tremble followed when he turned around her body was one of a thousand on the streets he ran towards her stood by her arm unable to see her face the call drops i begin to count the ways i tolerate my dry mouth to count the glasses of water i gave away to make up for my sins but this act does not count when we fall out of our hearts
after the painting by brent lynch the humid nights are best and worst best because the birds sing at two in the morning when you can not get back into the other world worst because it is the moist heat that makes the skin supple makes you want to rub against someone else a woman and there is nothing but the long list of lost chances things you could have said perhaps the simple question of will you sleep with me so that it is not just you and this shell of a home this place where it feels the walls are another layer of my skin and that is neither best or worst it is the holding of the dead stink the memories that was over him holding them back it is the utter singleness of being the only person here the way the thoughts think themselves down to accepting that this is really just me here wondering who i am just me here wondering why i am awake at two which trigger it was knowing all the time all too well the way the war of life is connected to the nervous system of the world the ganglia of our shared horrors either mine so large or so people tell me and here it seems to be the membrane between the skin of my bones and the skin of this home the absorbing shock of space that gives when the memories burn their way in or out of me i would lie here wondering how to tell her i am wrestling with the angel wrestling with memories in the crevices and cracks of my body of how i feel right now what it felt like then in those times and i am glad she is not here and i wish she were here and she has no name because this is some woman i do not know i practice in the silence of my thoughts the different pitch and rhythm of how i might ask will you sleep with me afraid of what to say should she say yes and this decade of my monkish life should lie open and i have to say why i am sitting on the edge of the bed why i have woke her from the sweet smile i assume she has when i assume her horror is smaller than mine
for hsing hui a thing as delicious as turning the last sound i heard into a word it can not be or calling your hidden wish out into the broad space of the public to make you touch me instead of asking that i go naked a thing as delicious as any of that would not be as safe as a dumb silence i am resting my back with a cushion against the chair sitting inside the ache when i soaked myself in a balm the way women went to the river and held things down until they were as wet as jesus hanging in the rain his pain the invocation of roars destroying the temple the things i know are not the things you wish to know or they are and i can not give them to you until i see what you think of contracts of what binds the mornings to unkind sunlight what takes a hawk and lets it know there are things less grand than flying things that crave
it is the twilight blue chevrolet four doors with no power but the engine whitewall tires no padding on the dashboard the car i drive on dates park on dark lanes to ask for a kiss now my hand goes along the fender wiping every spot the suds in the bucket my father standing at the gate poor and proud tall and stout a wise man a man troubled by a son gone missing in the head drag racing his only car at night traveling with hoodlums to leave the books for street life naming mentors the men who pack guns and knives a son gone missing from all the biblical truth ten talents prophecies burning bushes dirty cars washed on saturday morning he tells me not to miss a spot to open the hood when i 'm done so he can check the oil the vital thing like blood blood of kinship blood spilled in the streets of baltimore blood oozing from the soul of a son walking prodigal paths leading to gutters years later i tell him the stories of what his brother-in-law did to me and he wipes a tear from the corner of his eye wraps it in a white handkerchief for church walks up the stairs with the aluminum crutch to scream at the feet of black jesus and in these brittle years of his old age we grow deeper talk way after midnight peeping over the rail of his hospital bed as we wash the twilight blue chevrolet
she would post herself in the way in lines headed to transfer stops to change or haunt intersections with four way full scarecrow indecision stop on the corners of streets and in the aisles of buses preaching only that which has never left these crossings for road for choice — the angry fear she seats at the feasts — thanksgiving any holiday any family place setting — the hunger of others ’ satisfaction for herself she seeks it said this is what she deserves if only of herself what she thinks she thinks needs to be said whatever anyone else thinks to be honest so there she sings from that part of the door she ’ s never got through the eye which requires it all taken off down all blown away to get through to that still naked-ness of clear again even if she ’ s not still the voice comes through that if we could listen as she is equally raw hear with meat and gut below the skin beyond the last violence to the silence just before the bone if we could still hear there we ’ d hear 2 what hand can you offer one wanting just to get even for what it doesn ’ t know what just to take out what it feels on someone else to hurt because it can ’ t get at where it hurts itself to have to see to clear like a movie fakes done seeing sharper than thought can cut to it what hand can you offer one that doesn ’ t know even as a balance any other than more as my half and who counts itself that much more and that more proofless multiple unanswerably human hurts because it can ’ t figure out a figure to answer how it wants so count doesn ’ t count higher than want and want also falls short enough to take someone down for it but there is no size for another to be cut down to but none but death this is so frustrating 3 you see me get the hell away from her don ’ t you quick as i can and i bein nice she act all girlfriend but that bitch dangerous she pull so much rotten shit on peoples she due to get her ass killed anytime and i don ’ t tend to be nowhere near round i ain ’ t getting cut down just for standin next to her i ain ’ t all that innocent but i don ’ t be lookin for nothing i don ’ t deserve
we were riding out to an abandoned farmhouse on his pearl black triumph deaf to the sound of bleating sheep that was when he told me it was the same model james dean had swapped for three days after they ’ d finished filming east of eden i tried to tell him that was cool but he didn ’ t act like he ’ d heard me so i hugged him tight and set my head on his shoulder and watched how the yellow moon was shifting behind the pines like the face of a jailbird he ’ d told me before that his wife knew he didn ’ t swing her way but she was keeping quiet about it for their kid ’ s sake we rumbled into the dry grass and started cutting through the cornstalks into a big clearing where he kicked the bike stand and told me to get off he tossed his chrome aviators and then we started our hike to the farmhouse which was sagging in the field opposite of us we were quiet on the way like a couple of thieves about to rob someone blind i stood back as he tore a warped door off the barn and flung it into the gravel inside the air was dusty and thick and the moon was still with us cocked behind a streaked window like we ’ d traded places and now we were the jailbirds serving a lifetime sentence without parole john pulled off his steel-toe boots and told me to wait for him up in the hayloft i left my loafers there and climbed a wood ladder until i was looking into the eyes of a great horned owl he kept shaking his head like he couldn ’ t believe what was about to happen i was going to be john ’ s first but while i was gathering the wet straw i smelled smoke and slid back down the ladder that was when i saw the fire licking the crossbeams and ran outside john was passing through the wheat like a final judgment his figure was muscled with flame and i kept silent as he reached for a head of grain and burned it to the ground
i thank the spiders ’ webs and the circus dancers who stain our eyes with rapid movements and authorize our handcuffs to make no distinction between night and day or love and hate no one will know the sum of our arduous daily separations from bed to work these pillars actually belong to you since i have not counted them or know any more than you do where they are or in what country they still exist we can put all our concerns into a loaf of bread and french kisses go to movies and watch the splashing milk on the screen imitate the forest in the moonlight why all the fuss about the patrons becoming feathers discharging their ideas of nobility on the evening news there are no lights in the theater just soft snow from the balcony that is the little red schoolhouse where all this began actually it was because of you i did not attend as often as i should have i was too embarrassed to face you across the clay modeling tables since i always felt like the clay in your hands was a cartoon version of my teen years dear slippery-fish ladies of the sleepy west don ’ t forget my early life will be yours too with its self-descriptions of poetic justice the tiny creatures we write about can describe themselves in the moss we leave behind

i need more time a simple day in paris hotels and window shopping the croissants will not bake themselves and the tower of london would like to spend a night in the tropics with gray sassy paint it has many wounds and historic serial dreams under contract to hollywood who will play the head of mary queen of scots and who will braid her hair was it she who left her lips on the block for the executioner whose hands would never find ablution who would never touch a woman again or eat the flesh of a red animal blood pudding would repulse him until joining anne that is the way of history written for marlow and shakespear they are with us now that we are sober and wiser not taking the horrors of poetry too seriously why am i telling you this nonsense when i have never seen you sip your coffee or tea in the morning not to mention never heard you sing although some claim it is quite grand will you teach me to sing like chaliapin will i impress you with my cartoon russian accent i like sour cream and borsht we went to school together my minor was caviar and blinis this is what it means to listen to boris godunov late at night cool mornings are for lakmé and songs of flowers for misplaced lovers but why should we speak in a foreign language to each other we are not birds i have other stories too strange and beautiful to be told they have no sound or memory they will rest on your lips when you bring your hands to your mouth to stop their gush of air against your face we should go back and meet again at the street fair of cufflinks our hearts teach us how to fly with wings of pain that is the price of the disarticulated lessons we should not abstain from playing the accumulated misdemeanors add up to the most egregious felony ignoring the demands of the heart we remain in abeyance to the muses who are only interested in their outcomes we are just the worms on their hooks of selfishness what do they care we are not greek we are just a dream of pleasant comic arias that suffice as whims in the morning we are small enemies to them with strange large hearts that control the weather in the heavens they can not change or unteach us not to trespass their quarters of endowment perhaps after all you are an affable spirit bubbling over with your own deductions to minimize the pointed dots in your beautiful endeavors although i feel like a bird with a broken wing each day i think of you i fumble an attempt to fly to impress you with the color of my paper wings
lives on an island of last-ditch attempts and ancient consolations after the shipwreck she swam ashore near naked hands scraped raw on coral bra and panties soaked through sand in her teeth lapped by aftermath lying exhausted slowly approaching the condition of music he loved her stubborn luster sure they argued sometimes the word `` argue '' from latin meaning to make clear while she sat quietly in the wing chair her eyes closed police ransacked his desk the note turned up in his pocket with the letter for his sister a baseball ticket stub receipts for two `` taco platters '' he whose soul was bound up with mine and part of a bookmark six weeks later she looks great thin and translucent a statue of justice sans blindfold she wears beautiful blouses now peach gold seedling green her complexion has never been better lushness nips at the heels of destruction tonight 's lurid sunset's a cocktail of too many boozes she 'd like to switch it off via remote control but there 's no antidote for celestial events a frantic bat takes a wrong turn from the attic veers into her living room bounces off walls a sick flut-thud each time it hits the suicide 's wife pulls out her roasting pan climbs the kitchen counter teeters and grabs for twenty minutes at last claps on the lid walks her prize outside releases the creature into the trees where the lawn peters out where the idea that at death something is liberated can flap blackly away
we could hear her knocking down strands of cobweb from ceilings—sticky filaments sacs of eggs—as we woke most mornings to a worm of discontent it lodged beneath the heart rubbed our frayed nerves gnawed at the gut spleen ovaries filth was mom 's first enemy so each day began with ritual cleaning the stab and sweep of the broom down the dark hall over the stained and scratched oak floors for weeks she held her dust mop one-handed and with the other cupped a hernia while she swore at us kids in that hard voice—a litany of our sins and failures sloth stupidity secrecy we watched her smash the spiders that ran herky-jerky along the baseboards while we ran too glaring at each other we gathered up the scattered laundry our father ’ s shoes his newspapers and tools our books drawings music sweatshirts and jackets whatever we ’ d left lying around we were guilty but good at evasion we cultivated shrewish or obsessive behaviors of our own my tough older sister sneered and stalked out of the house to meet her boyfriend my sweet younger sister trembled and cried comforted by one of our many dogs i slammed doors pounded them with my fists screamed “ shut up shut up shut up ” she couldn ’ t leave us alone she loved us too much though we were quick she was quicker her words stung we must have deserved it
shadows lengthened while we sat stuck in traffic just beyond san rafael headlights had begun to flare in the cool dusk the hum of the car 's engine lulled me and i put my forehead against the glass looking out over a darkening landscape we were headed to the bishop 's ranch a weekend retreat for episcopal young churchmen in hilly country that would someday produce superlative wines with garnet hues that stain the inside of a glass i was queasy from the lurching of the car the stops and starts the smell of exhaust though trembling with cold i was too shy to ask the lady the mother of one of the other girls to turn on the heater i imagined pale pink blossoms on the japanese plum apple trees laden with white flowers and north of sebastapol the vibrant yellow of daffodils on slender pleated stems that night i slept in a single bunk made up with thin sheets and blankets a warm sun the next day restored me but in the evening seated by the fire that crackled in the fireplace of the big lodge i felt flushed our recently ordained curate we were not to know he was gay till some years later had asked me to bring my guitar and now he wanted me to sing about the girl who decides to sleep next to her mother her whole life long instead of falling for an unfaithful suitor i sang we all sang together young father w. had a wonderful tenor voice his smile reassured me but now i was tired and earlier than the others i decided to return to the dorm in that clear march night the sky gleamed like black ink and stars blazed bright and alive walking downhill guitar in hand i suddenly stumbled with dizziness and the slope swam before me “ hold on hold on ” i told myself as i nearly fell onto the dew-slick lawn for a moment i could sense myself floating away from my body back in the dorm i crawled into bed and lay shuddering with cold bones aching the room seemed to spin i wanted to be home but the thought of facing my mother filled me with terrible dismay i knew the blue failure notice mailed by the school would have arrived sure enough it lay open on the dining table when i got home the following afternoon a sunday fog hardly a mist had blown in from the bay and was gathering in the eucalyptus across the ravine the house was steamy a basket of clean laundry occupied a chair atop a stack of san francisco chronicles mom sat at the table sewing but i knew she was scowling i thought it wise to look industrious so i began to fold towels and pillowcases “ what i want to know ” began my mother “ is whether you have any ambition obviously you will never get to college what do you expect to do with your life ” she paused and i shrugged “ go ahead and shrug do you think your girlfriend is going to take care of you that won ’ t last long and why is it you only fall in love with girls well i suppose you want to be a boy. ” what an unutterable failure i am i retreated burned by her ferocious upright anger “ oh yes i ’ m sure you ’ re sick but you will go to school tomorrow ” that night wracked again with cold unable to stop my trembling i sought my parents ’ bed stood moaning till mom woke and let me under the covers where she tried to warm me with her body weeks later we learned that one of my classmates a robust girl who shot baskets as well as any boy had succumbed to the illness and died that night my mother placed her hand on my forehead–her smooth palm her touch gentle–and said to my barely awake dad “ our daughter has a raging fever. ” like a miracle i was still her child comforted i slept
ours was a play-filled childhood irrigation ditches ran deep during the summers we played in the water and dirt then inscribed abcs and numbers onto the smooth ground our cat polly died of rabies then all the pets had to be shot some in the rib cage as they thrashed in panic there was a pink bruise on my forehead from pressing against the wall we could n't figure out how such a thing could happen the dogs were steadfast figures around the farm they chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep panic among visitors and passersby they had cuts and bruises from scuffles with roaming packs no tags were inscribed with their random navajo names snazzy was skinny his rib cage obvious through thin fur he looked as if he might die from hunger but he ate like nobody 's business who knew he would die of rabies with the rest the main thing was to figure out how they contracted it my parents said we cried until our rib cages ached our eyes stayed swollen this first loss was too deep to even talk about decades later i can finally describe how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise that would last forever but our neighbor suffered worse bruises their huge dog named dog was the first to die and was the cause of all this their home and fields are inscribed in our memories as `` the rabies place '' over time they must have figured it was too much to live down childhood losses run deep even though we are grandparents now the memory is an invisible cage of anguished sobs gunshots yelping howls canine rib cages exploding sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars that initial deep hurt was the start we found of how love could die right before us even as we watched stunned figures pleading for mercy urgent prayers saying `` let god 's scribe mark this down we 've paid our dues our hearts are inscribed with loss after loss '' for some reason after everything our rib cages held up and continued to cradle tender hearts they must have figured that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises that would weaken us our love for those homely animals was deep and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises are n't endless and that our rib cages are not mere bones one can die from grief so now we can describe loss and love as the holy twins
was it like lifting a veil and was the grass treacherous the green grass did you think of your own mother was it like a virus did the software flicker and was this the beginning was it like that was there gas station food and was it a long trip and is there sun there or drones or punishment or growth was it a blackout and did you still create me and what was i like on the first day of my life were we two from the start and was our time an entrance or an ending did we stand in the heated room did we look at the painting did the snow appear cold were our feet red with it with the wet snow and then what were our names did you love me or did i misunderstand is it terrible do you intend to come back do you hear the world ’ s keening will you stay the night
to iretha a textbook photograph most likely led me to think the rosetta stone the size of a library ’ s old webster ’ s third edition or two loaves of bread on a side board but here it stands three tongues or one mind that can say three ways we say the one thing the breaths and sights of each way in rock a milestone in intangibles between them reflected light from outside through the entrance duplicating on the glass case the door image that the stone itself is opens when you walk around behind it exhibit the inhibition of letters and i see you not a translation step through from beyond all description into the calling of flesh in black skin beauty beauty beauty

because she 'd heard him laugh through new moon darkness and she knew he 'd fallen and she knew before she turned he 'd be crawling like a crawdad rock to loam— because she tried to love the straight back and neck he 'd erected to recollect the man he 'd been before—because she found herself adding up his usefulness like some kind of auctioneer—she showed him the dark coils areoling both her breasts and all the ways she bent and lifted bent and lifted steady strong she let him believe he was past due for a harvest and her hands were the right ones now to hold onto the scythe • she made quick work of pleasure the boysmile bunked down in his eyes she claimed her tongue found the place in his mouth where the teeth were gone—where he 'd hold his corncakes until they grew soft enough to chew history had bedded him in all of this—his own history and failures not his own before he 'd tramped in she 'd watched another man—a man she 'd thought she 'd hated—watched his body opened opened opened until blood had married brine she 'd watch that man be whipped into something good for nothing more than fertilizing clay and she 'd thought buckshot would have been a brand of kindness if sprayed into him just then but even after his hard going she did not miss him very much • anyone she chose could be shucked like surplus property tomorrow but that had n't been enough to warn her off of picking him that night because she knew if she set her sight on nothing she 'd get nothing in return she 'd walked with him but because the night progressed so —because there were some clouds—no stars—no moon—he 'd tripped over the branch of a dead and down tree in all that darkness there without a moon even then she had not fallen she thought to say so but she did not say so she did nothing but say she was sorry for him she did not use her mouth to say this could he not listen to her hands they spoke softly articulating her condolences to his torn and bleeding skin

i never thought michiko would come back after she died but if she did i knew it would be as a lady in a long white dress it is strange that she has returned as somebody 's dalmation i meet the man walking her on a leash almost every week he says good morning and i stoop down to calm her he said once that she was never like that with other people sometimes she is tethered on their lawn when i go by if nobody is around i sit on the grass when she finally quiets she puts her head in my lap and we watch each other 's eyes as i whisper in her soft ears she cares nothing about the mystery she likes it best when i touch her head and tell her small things about my days and our friends that makes her happy the way it always did

pillows ribbons harness barefoot friends haughty sisters smiles mothers watch snoring dirty jeep broken january darkness steals my grief i can not imagine something more fragile than marriage you held my hand we listened to the callas arias on our porch you kept rewinding the love song back to the beginning to the place where she saings certainly not today leaf shadows tent walls my tongue traces tattoos scars strange shirts mingle in the dryer tangled sand uncomfortable legs wasted days spent memorizing the body i 'd soon share bride bridge bridle all signs said do n't wife her i have learned how to hollow beginnings rewind homes wedding veils your drool the doorknob clumsy knots today the map is mortified in bed polka dots miscarriage weather changes leaves fragile-making not even divorcing in the eyes of the law dissolving i remember my sorrow at finding ants housed in my mother 's peonies when we moved the new residents tore out all her flower beds the strawberry patch the treehouse i drove you there to show you you held my hand
for nate pritts the friend lives half in the grass and half in the chocolate cake walks over to your house in the bashful light of november or the forceful light of summer you put your hand on her shoulder or you put your hand on his shoulder the friend is indefinite you are both so tired no one ever notices the sleeping bags inside you and under your eyes when you ’ re talking together about the glue of this life the sticky saturation of bodies into darkness the friend ’ s crisis of faith about faith is unnerving in its power to influence belief not in or toward some other higher power but away from all power in the grass or the lake with your hand on her shoulder your hand on his shoulder you tell the friend the best things you can imagine and every single one of them has already happened so you recount them of great necessity with nostalgic atomic ferocity and one by one by one until many the eggbirds whistle the gargantuan trees the noiserocks fall twisted into each other ’ s dreams their colorful paratrooping their skinny dark jeans little black walnuts to the surface of this earth you and the friend remain twisted together thinking your simultaneous and inarticulate thoughts in physical lawlessness in chemical awkwardness it is too much to be so many different things at once the friend brings black hole candy to your lips and jumping off the rooftops of your city the experience so much confusion — the several layers of exhaustion and being a friend with your hands in your pockets and the friend ’ s hands in your pockets o bitter black walnuts of this parachuted earth o gongbirds and appleflocks the friend puts her hand on your shoulder the friend puts his hand on your shoulder you find a higher power when you look

for micah ruelle we were not green in judgment or cold in blood like cleopatra in her youth who still was ordering chopped radish in her bowls back then the hearts all gone to pieces next to the winter greens that in our days we never had use for so smitten were we with fire and ovens that i was gravy in judgment which might not mean much unless you ’ ve taken a spoon of it and poured it back over a dumpling shaped like your heart so that it became even softer something you could not have thought possible it ’ s all happening now you liked to say and i agreed though it was not the news from the outside i relished but the daily extra extra the light of the morning brought to my attention every time we woke in your house or my house and my heart — salty risen — was warm again in a way it hadn ’ t been for years organ of passion organ of righteousness that has never had a single flavor cross its lips how could you know how much i would miss the honey of those days her drizzle of it on the turkey bacon my cracking pepper up and down the pan the sweet meat of happiness i would no longer let pass between our teeth
i loved a girl when i was a girl before i knew desire could be used against me i so wanted to be relevant simple exchange— bouquets of wheat my dirt-stained hands tangled hair i never could be prim in apple-pie order i dropped all the eggs licking their smear off my hands wrinkled her ribbons into my pocket tore pages from her books all for the sake of the lonely hour
because this song ’ s made of the airwaves a time machine you start to play the air guitar of memory making a country so you can walk back into it like a man on rewind in a silent film his whiskey tumbler filling up again as he rises from his stool and steps backwards towards the avenue where the cars cabs trucks reverse away from him and the lights for once turn amber to green where the two hands on his watch unravel time like a maiden aunt unpicking a whole evening ’ s worth of knitting over the dropped stitch that means she must go back before she can go on you raise the record from its sleeve again hold it grail-like into the wayward light to read the liner notes on a life you ’ ve lived all wrong wind in the sycamores outside rain coming down in a town you left behind and not this one where the backward longing can strike you anytime — breath on the nape of your neck when you ’ re the only one in line cat with a broken spine dragging itself off into the undergrowth to die where the silence might give way to a high-hat or snare drum the lub-dub of the bass a brass section after a long absence you take up the thread again take up the line what you listen for try not to listen for stirring the tiny hairs within your inner ear weighting the wet tip of your tongue like the scuff and fumble of the blind needle finding its way from silence to the first track on side one you nod your head “ yes. ” you sing along you tap the steering wheel of the car in which you pass under a strobe of stars a quarter moon until despite yourself you are sixteen again and walking home in a downpour with your ken dodd quiff your flowers of sulfur toward the box of records from which you ’ ll pick a tune to name the afternoon its scattered showers with a chance of sunny spells later its gust and bluster from rathlin to cape clear this one would sound good in a stadium it ’ s all guitar shimmer tremolo arm a chorus that staggers smitten toward the open bar this one ’ s a plea a paean on just six strings until the horns cut in like the bully at a prom it recalls the taste of cigarettes and bubblegum on the tongue of the first girl you ever kissed all broken glass and bruised finger its swoon circles forever the turntable in that blue room where you fed and watered every slight and scar and so you ’ d like to thank the engineer his assistant who provides the harmonies and made the tea the trumpet player his spit still wet in the mouth of a solo that the vinyl keeps pristine black box recorder to your submerged plane the singer with a bone stuck in her throat which is another way to say “ longing. ” the producer who fills in on hammond organ you could go on like this lost in the noise again in your baroque joy at what was and is and what the words become talking to yourself in the second person as if you ’ re fooling anyone reading the liner notes on a life you measure song by song
i ’ ll choose for myself next time who i ’ ll reach out and take as mine in the way i might stand at a fruit stall having decided to ignore the apples the mangoes and the kiwis but hold my hands above a pile of oranges as if to warm my skin before a fire not only have i chosen oranges but i ’ ll also choose which orange — i ’ ll test a few for firmness scrape some rind off with my fingernail so that a citrus scent will linger there all day i won ’ t be happy with the first one i pick but will try different ones until i know you how will i know you you ’ ll feel warm between my palms and i ’ ll cup you like a handful of holy water a vision will come to me of your exotic land the sun you swelled under the tree you grew from a drift of white blossoms from the orange tree will settle in my hair and i ’ ll know this is how i will choose you by feeling you smelling you by slipping you into my coat maybe then i ’ ll climb the hill look down on the town we live in with sunlight on my face and a miniature sun burning a hole in my pocket thirsty i ’ ll suck the juice from it from you when i walk away i ’ ll leave behind a trail of lamp-bright rind
the eiffel tower erected itself in my head we couldn ’ t find the lifts climbed the stairs of course there were fireworks we stared at each other rare exhibits in the louvre — you licked my mona lisa smile right off of course we were both in imaginary chanel we drank warm cider and ate pancakes yours flambéed i got drunk my tights laddered on both legs of course we experienced tachycardia at the moulin rouge our hotel a boxed macaron on a navy boulevard — we spun around in the dark outside rain-dizzy of course we slept at the ritz our little room tucked into the corner a pink pocket you slipped into that night of course our fingers hunted for change in the mirrored elevator i couldn ’ t meet your eye i crushed you into the laminated sample menu and died of course it was only la petite mort
we drink too much pineapple rum straight from the bottle bitch about the red-haired girl the fetish model a preacher ’ s daughter with a thing for unreasonable shoes from her faded patchwork quilt bleeding hearts we watched her mutate into a pvc alice liddell how did she manage in seven-inch patent heels she was tall as wheat — or the ceiling was low cradling a mewing ginger-ball she kissed the mirror where their confederate-blue eyes matched three scars began to scab on her arm deep big-cat scrawls she told us she cut herself because it ’ s art and her clients like her that way we followed her clip-clop down the rabbit hole me to hear tales of her running track in those shoes you to see her white skin even paler under lights back in your dorm room i am static you pay to watch her pixelated snow white online complain her constant chatter ruined it or her for you
nothing for days then a message “ i want to see a fight an old one ” so i bring a fight to you you know nothing of these men even the most famous get to slink in their youth again — for you foreman is leviathan unstoppable ali just past his prime flown “ home ” to muscle back his title not sure how you ’ ll react to violence we lie down again together — your feet in woollen stockings kneadable across my thighs your mouth close to my ribs and their inmate a pouting lifer i fidget and you scold as ali opens up with right-hand leads you flinch but soon you ’ re lost to the screen where he waits it out along the ropes takes everything foreman throws you don ’ t believe he can soak up all this pain and go on standing we cheer him on winter softened in the tropic of his strength when ali comes alive to put foreman on the ground i see a hallelujah look as you turn to face me “ he won ” you say into my cheek “ he did ” i say
castaways we hit the forest — our camping stove turned low i gripped my tent close for its trial in virgin attitudes of stiffness while lamps fluttered on the dark my roof sank wave on wave accordion-like the only sin we knew and soon the jameson appeared i ’ d burned one back and by the third she laid her hand on mine like a napkin ... later i caught those tiny gasps from joan and michael ’ s tent where he slipped into her like this i thought a frog à la bashō those dark rippling walls where she kept center held her breath so i had to puzzle how one could leave and neither be alone
walking to the hospital how the autumn dawn burned through the misty broods and settled down in fire how quickly the sun glittered my shadow how my shadow cried a moment with joy a light frost a vision of light crackling down the maples down the tinder ash i was the good thief i held my love ’ s sweet breath his beautiful intelligent gaze i closed my eyes and he woke inside me when i saw he saw the inflamed world a bird sang deeply from the gutter eaves when i closed my eyes i was elsewhere i walked through the fire of his sleep leaving early my love tonight fionnuala is your nurse you ’ ll hear her voice sing-song around the ward lifting a wing at the shore of your darkness i heard that in another life she too journeyed through a storm a kind of curse with the ocean rising darkly around her fierce with cold and no resting place only the frozen rocks that tore her feet the light on her shoulders and no cure there but to wait it out if while i ’ m gone your fever comes down— if the small salt-laden shapes of her song appear as a first glimmer of earth-light follow the sweet hopeful voice of that landing she will keep you safe beneath her wing in your sleep after “ the lark ascending ” by ralph vaughan williams the moment the lark finally vanishes into the spread green sky of the forest is the moment you suddenly lift your bruised arm up over your body as though to show me the wing ’ s eclipse or the wing or the season of your dream and even as your hand lapses silent onto your chest and your breath goes sluggish i am already watching your feet prepare their slow first step under the sheet as the last notes of sunlight fall quiet and you do not move again my love are you a bird reviving in a summer field was it the lark ascending that you heard a ghost among its shy-hearted tunes yes i heard the lark escaping too
the girl from the satellite town holds berries in the fast stream supermarket queue she carries her longing like a stream of song her melody a body over the boundary of what is solid and what flows the guys in the depression- hit town are tripping in the fruit aisle falling for her berry lightness they slip out from their outlines one guy says she takes the form of a dream or the dream of a form on the page of the regional night berries pulse like the notes of a song in the stream the girl who sheds the skin of her longing escapes into more longing in a dream on the margins of town one of the guys hears a girl sing her voice like strings a basket of ripe berries floating into the night on a stream the girl the guy in derelict bedrooms hear lucent songs undressing streaming from their outlines through the boundaries of town wrapping around them the scent of fresh berries and i was the guy and the girl was within the page of the town ever over after never the song long long long long the stream is slipped as the ground you stand on build houses out of song the berries are undressing the stream is long gone long the girl dreams a form of dream or forms a dream of form the boundaries of song in the night undressed as a stream in the morning
1 desert heat high clouds and sky the color of lapis on this journey anything seems possible so we stop by an ancient cottonwood to kiss the beauty trembles does n't say a word just watches me so open small birds fly by flock in the shady tree above us what settles in her heart what congeals hope despair far off the river churns in its sandy banks swallows veer turn in fiery air will these kisses seal her to me i her lover she my wife is all of this a dream my whole life 2 she is just this side of wonderful and suddenly the glamorous world fills itself with shining and we laugh at highway monuments that explain how hard the trek had been for franciscans in the indian wilderness poor fellows— conversion is the devil 's own work then the stones of her dream turn up under her feet the back of a huge land turtle i know we must be circling paradise because the ants enter the fleshy petals of the roadside flowers with evident joy and purpose oh my dark pretty one 3 music my adored when is there never music my accordion puffs up with drinkable melodies i spill her tunes into your listening ear one after the other the squeeze-box enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy with its hard rhythms lilts the back- breaking labor song the worker croons to earth warbles romantic notes of dissolving borders you melt like a woman beneath her lover 's touch music is happy and pitiless when it sets fire to combustible souls even the raspy bandoneon 's voice is lyric 4 sacred sacred sacred sacred speak in a whisper we slip into this space half cognizant the land is very large indeed bones of the earth worn down though she is a living thing see how she exposes her grace antelopes graze on the far plain—their high white tails—the red soil throbs its slow heartbeat and the blue sky clears so smartly perfectly like radiance are the ancestors near what can we know we decide to wander around this prairie mistaken for utes buy commodities in little towns 5 late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked malheur after the long curve of the snake river plain above the falls where the shoshone went to pray we soaked our feet in cold water and i observed the arch of her brown foot rabbitbrush and sage along the highway juniper on far hills and bluffs sundown and dusk falls over the wide basin of land in burns we eat eggs in a cafe take a room in the motel 6. in the dark i can see her black hair black against the pillows its clean scent makes me think of corn at dawn i hold her and there are kisses then more kisses then more the day is cold a north wind blew last night but the land is open rain falls in showers of light 6 her hand on my thigh my shoulder in my hair she leans over to kiss my cheek we look at each other smile for miles we travel this way nearly silent point with eyes or chins at the circling hawk the king- fisher on the snag above the swollen creek one night i weep in her arms as she cries `` oh oh oh '' because i have touched her scars lightly throat belly breasts in that communion of lovers thick sobs break from me as i think of my love back home all that i have done and can not say this is the first time i have left her so completely so alone
i would have come when you called but i had the most beautiful pale pink rose its healthy stem was clenched between my teeth and its thorns bit sharply into my tender wet flesh so i could n't answer you still my lips moved at you silently they offered words you never heard they screamed inside my crazed brain only it could do nothing for you in time the petals wilted they blew away and they became compost in someone else 's garden the tough fibrous stem withered i bit down hard to snap its grip on me then my teeth fell out its thorns had burrowed into my cheeks they had implanted themselves permanently they were suckling on my softest tissues and not long after they sprouted tiny shoots they coiled their way down i still held the memory of your call and the long stemmed beauty lodged next to it they cleaved unto the long roots curling down my neck my body held tight and listened hard
all night vigil my two-and-a-half-year-old boy and his 10-month-old sister lay on the same bed facing opposite ends their feet touching they looked soft peaceful bundled there in strands of blankets i brushed away roaches that meandered across their faces but not even that could wake them outside the dark cover of night tore as daybreak bloomed like a rose on a stem of thorns i sat down on the backsteps gazing across the yellowed yard a 1954 chevy bel-air stared back it was my favorite possession i hated it just then it didn ’ t start when i tried to get it going earlier that night it had a bad solenoid i held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap i expected trouble from the paragons gang of the west lynwood barrio somebody said i dove the car that dudes from colonia watts used to shoot up the paragons ’ neighborhood but i got more than trouble that night my wife had left around 10 p.m. to take a friend of mine home she didn ’ t come back i wanted to kill somebody at moments it had nothing to do with the paragons it had to do with a woman i loved but who to kill not her– sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt i ’ d kill myself first kill me first but she was the one who quit kill her no think man i was hurt angry but to kill her to kill a paragon to kill anybody i went into the house and put the gun away later that morning my wife came for her things some clothes the babies their toys a radio broken tv and some dishes remained i didn ’ t stop her there was nothing to say that my face didn ’ t explain already nothing to do but run so i drove the long haul to downey and parked near an enclosed area alongside the los angeles river i got out of the car climbed over the fence and stumbled down the slopes a small line of water rippled in the middle on rainy days this place flooded and flowed but most of the time it was dry with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture since a child the river and its veins of canals were places for me to think places to heal once on the river ’ s bed i began to cleanse i ran i ran into the mist of morning carrying the heat of emotion through the sun ’ s rays i ran past the factories that lay smack in the middle of somebody ’ s backyard i ran past alleys with overturned trashcans and mounds of tires debris lay underfoot overgrown weeds scraped my legs as i streamed past recalling the song of bullets that whirred in the wind i ran across bridges beneath overhead passes and then back alongside the infested walls of the concrete river splashing rainwater as i threaded my heels colliding against the pavement so much energy propelled my legs and just like the river it went on for miles when all was gone the concrete river was always there and me always running
like the horn you played in catholic school the city will open its mouth and cry out do n't worry 'bout nothing do n't mean no thing it will leave you stunned as a fighter with his eyes swelled shut who 's told he won the whole damn purse it will feel better than any floor that 's risen up to meet you it will rise like easter bread golden and familiar in your grandmother 's hands she 'll come back heaven having been too far from home to hold her o it will be beautiful every girl will ask you to dance and the boys wo n't kill you for it shake your head dance until your bones clatter what a prize you are what a lucky sack of stars
my heart is bleeding it bleeds upward and fills my mouth up with salt it bleeds because of a city in ruins the chair still warm from sister 's body because it will all be irreproducible my heart bleeds because of baby bear not finding mama bear and it bleeds to the tips of my fingers like i painted my nails crimson sometimes my heart bleeds so much i am a raisin it bleeds until i am a quivering ragged clot bleeds at the ending with the heroine and her sunken cancer eyes at the ending with the plaintive flute over smoke-choked killing fields i 'm bleeding a river of blood right now and it 's wearing a culvert in me for the blood my heart rises up in me becomes the cork of me and i choke on it i am bleeding for you and for me and for the tiny babies and the ied-blown leg it bleeds because i 'm made that way all filled up with blood my sloppy heart a sponge filled with blood to squeeze onto any circumstance because it is mine it will always bleed my heart bled today it bled onto the streets and the steps of city hall it bled in the pizza parlor with the useless jukebox i 've got so much blood to give inside and outside of any milieu even for a bad zoning decision i 'll bleed so much you 'll be bleeding all of us bleeding in and out like it 's breathing or kissing and because it is righteous and terrible and red
for richard before the days of self service when you never had to pump your own gas i was the one who did it for you the girl who stepped out at the sound of a bell with a blue rag in my hand my hair pulled back in a straight unlovely ponytail this was before automatic shut-offs and vapor seals and once while filling a tank i hit a bubble of trapped air and the gas backed up came arcing out of the hole in a bright gold wave and soaked me — face breasts belly and legs and i had to hurry back to the booth the small employee bathroom with the broken lock to change my uniform peel the gas-soaked cloth from my skin and wash myself in the sink light-headed scrubbed raw i felt pure and amazed — the way the amber gas glazed my flesh the searing subterranean pain of it how my skin shimmered and ached glowed like rainbowed oil on the pavement i was twenty in a few weeks i would fall for the first time in love that man waiting patiently in my future like a red leaf on the sidewalk the kind of beauty that asks to be noticed how was i to know it would begin this way every cell of my body burning with a dangerous beauty the air around me a nimbus of light that would carry me through the days how when he found me weeks later he would find me like that an ordinary woman who could rise in flame all he would have to do is come close and touch me
love 's balustrade love 's balcony a few iron words that can be seen anywhere still in grocery lists in laundry hung between two objects an e-mail in an apology in a thought about the weather these rusty words these rusting gates before a breath standing in the cold morning on a cold blue stairs with a curlicue of coffee you look at the word love written on the side of the pharmacy in cherry-vanilla flavored cursive because this is where a love poem once stood what i am saying right now is secretly built over a love poem the fossils of a cupola pink buildings with red hyphens and dashes and three red dots you second person pink with shutters you could open with a fingernail like in an advent calendar to see sticker scenes of apartments inside a radiator a bare arm two cups by themselves on a table the mind of the attic still persists up there meditative water and the chairs talking quietly to one another it 's now pink rubble rhyming bricks and an illicit balcony the heart had such a fancy elevator that it started to look like a bird cage and once in a lemon-scented fog near springtime-fresh trees i heard two people say '' yellow kiss-shaped flowers telephone flowers are falling from my mouth now '' now it 's a set of blue and white checkered apartment buildings math problems that are eight stories high a long division jutting as pollution into the sky laundry cooking spills gasoline shirts commas theories or arguments of boyfriends girlfriends boyfriends boyfriends girlfriends girlfriends all hanging out of the window that you opened
this bald year frozen now in february this cold day winging over the ugly imperfect horizon line so often a teeth line of ten buildings a red flag flapping in the wind an orange curtain is noon it all hurts her eyes this curtain is so bright here is what is noticeably true sight the face that looks back from the side of the butter knife a torn-bread awkwardness the mind makes its daily pilgrimage through riff-raff moments then back into the caprice case to dream in a circle a pony goes round the circle 's association there 's a center to almost everything but never any certainty nothing is more malleable than a moment we were only yesterday breathing in a sea some summer sun asked us over and over we went the sand was hot we were only yesterday tender hearted waiting to be something a spring and then someone says sit down we have a heart for you to forget a mind to suffer with so experience so the circus tent you over there you be the girl in red sequins on the front of a card selling love you over there you in black satin you be the maiden 's mister death
nothing is nothing although he would call me that she was nothing those were his words but his hand was lifting cigarettes in chains and bridges of ash-light he said he did n't want his body to last it was n't a year i could argue against that kind of talk so i cut the fowl killed on the farm a mile out—brown and silvery wild— and put it over butter lettuce lettuce then lime i heated brandy in the saucepan poured a strip of molasses slowly through the cold slow as i 'd seen a shaman pour pine tincture over the floor of my beaten house she seemed to see my whole life by ordinance of some god who wanted me alive again burnt sage blue smoke then sea salt shaken into the corners of violent sadness she wrote my address across her chest to let everything listening know where my life was made we waited either forgetting what we were or becoming more brightly human in that pine in her trance in the lavender i set on the chipped sills not a trance at all but my deliberate hand cutting from the yard part of what she required now wait longer she said and i did as i would when the molasses warmed over the pot enough to come into the brandy to come into the night begun by small confessions— that this was just a rental and mine just a floor that the woman he loved was with another man his mother mad his apartment haunted in the crawl space then i told of the assault at daybreak between the houses heat asphalt all of it and my face toward the brick school where the apostolate studied first-century script and song there must have been chanting as it was on the hour what we said was liturgy meant only for us and for that night not for anyone else to repeat live by believe never that our only theories were inside of our hands flesh and land body and prairie i reached to smoke down his next-to-last which he lit and made ready the poultry like a war ration we ate all the way through what we wished we said what we said we found that night by these and no other means
september is work to the center of arguments and controversies prejudgments and incomprehensions what will i love if not that that was enigma the years of infancy memory says and there we are with the demon of the art of living traced on the glass of some window in the beauty of the night of may clear of moon to the lume of a candle there was a design like the profile of a landscape almost abandoned gone but not gone yet it 's fascinating these mysterious uncovered feelings enigma of an afternoon of autumn the picture of which is a composition of the eye of my mind every hour that i watch this picture i see again still that moment nevertheless the moment is an enigma for me in how much is inexplicable the physical things hide in the architecture of the event the enigma of a mock-up of a shadow the spectral and eternal aspect of the moment praises to you for being one great box of surprise your head the scene of a wonderful theater of the most tender gray of the fog that joins the sky to the earth a tangling of truth and memory mythology and iconography i watch with the eye of the mind the city that accommodates that one beautiful day that is now infinite it deepens it begins the cyclical method memory is deeply not alive it 's a mock-up and this renders it hateful yet it is not a fiction is a truth indeed a sad and monstrous truth i was assigned to you together we were a beautiful and melancholic picture this last picture is the realization of the overwhelming moment in which the acute eye perceives you as a now that is over a now that is fixed in the swept past
but what lovers we were what lovers even when it was all over— the bull-black deadweight wines that we swung towards each other rang and rang like bells of blood our own great hearts we slung the drunk boat out of port and watched our sober unreal life unmoor a continent of grief the candlelight strange on our faces like the tiny silent blazes and coruscations of its wars we blew them out and took the stairs into the night for the night 's work stripped off in the timbered dark gently hooked each other on like aqualungs and thundered down to mine our lovely secret wreck we surfaced later breathless back to back and made our way alone up the mined beach of the dawn
there is a plasticity to the soul that can fit inside sweaters but not inside drawers how many times can one watch the same porn video before one feels that they have become that porn video how many times can you attempt to untangle a cross i bought a black dress today — long and covered with sequins in the timorous shapes of stars when i paid for it i imagined myself sitting in it on a curb drinking beer with you so tell me what came first the beer or the dress you put my broken buddha lamp in the hall today because it “ just didn ’ t fit. ” i put you on the right side of my neck during a sex dream for the same reason pisces is the blue cheese of the zodiac signs are you a gemini rose-covered curtains give me anxiety and black gauze has the polar-opposite effect does styrofoam turn you on it is narcissistic to assume that anything likes to be liked by you it is narcissistic to assume that anything matters if you don ’ t i would like to be a man ray photograph more than i would like to be a person i would like to be the glass carnival wallpaper at your lips more than i would like to be a person would you fuck me against your window even though it is phobic to be naked in public i have a feeling that although you are a poet you think that poets are phony i have a feeling that it ’ s all a joke to you and i like it but i am not similar your lips came to me in a dream red and shiny like cartoon wool your lips came to me in a honda and i loved them away and i pushed them anyway i wanted to be a porn star your father wanted you to make boxes we both felt upset about the wanting we both learned that it is important to feel guiltless about smashing guitars i am a 5 p.m. person who buys cardigans to look like trash you are a 9 p.m. person who likes both kinds of nylon against your fingers i couldn ’ t concentrate in yoga because i was fixated on how much you ’ d like the ass of the girl in front of me i ’ m starting to believe that purple hair is cliché and i don ’ t like it i let myself get wet in the rain today because i wanted you to be proud of me when are my poems going to stop you this is just the long string of molecules this is just the long

on our first trip to the beach together i cut my foot on sharp rocks lining the shore and watched the ocean lick the crimson clean off the salt on my tongue a slight distraction from the deep blue the wide open the playground sting i ’ m sorry my flesh is softer than it has to be my skin thinner than yours i ’ m sorry there are parts of me i have scrubbed raw hurt i only wanted to be polished untainted good as new i ’ m sorry i didn ’ t see the waves crashing didn ’ t see any of this coming i ’ m sorry i wasn ’ t careful or strong when the sea soaked up my blood that day i thought maybe it needed to drink too needed to kiss needed to need i thought maybe you had always been right — when you drain my body of tears you also drain it of salt and dust so that you can shrink me down two sizes smaller and i can fit neatly into your life without taking up too much space so that you can carry me with you wherever you go to cities and mountains and valleys and all the oceans you ’ ve never explored tell me please if you find something tell me if you need me to search too tell me if there are places you still have to visit things you still have to unearth tell me if there ’ s any way to love you deep blue and wide open soft and scrubbed and thin flesh and skin shrinking bones raw parts any way at all without letting myself bleed shallow body 2014 by caitlin hazell
most of my regrets have to do with water light filtered through shower curtain your skin like yellowed paper i sat on bathroom tiles cold like clammy hands i didn ’ t want to hold and waited for you i didn ’ t think to be embarrassed then neither of us could sleep that night the floorboards creaked and only now do i feel guilty about sneaking into bed with you but that was months ago in a room i ’ ll never see again parts of us have begun to die they say that every seven years your body replaces each cell it has ever known soon i will be new again some nights in my dorm room i wake up crying and there ’ s nothing humble about it when moonlight spills across my bed like ilfosol-3 gets caught in my throat like a soreness it isn ’ t because i miss you rather the dark room at my old high school where i used tongs to move your picture from one chemical bath to another in a room i ’ ll never see again your face develops right in front of me stop bath 2014 by allegra lockstadt

i read your poem over and over in this landscape of women women purring on balconies overlooking the indigo sea my mother's blue taffeta dress is black as the sea she glides out my door to the beach where sleek white boats are anchored under a full luscious moon still i am still the wind outside my window my mother 's ghost evaporates in the long atlantic night i listen to the radio every chance i get for news of your city's latest disaster everything here the color of honey and sand everything there verges on catastrophe a constant preoccupation with real estate everything here a calm horizon taut bodies carefully nurtured oiled gleaming hair skin i read your poem over and over turning my head from prying eyes the low hum of women singing in another room i switch stations on the radio turn up the volume i almost touch the air buzzing electricity james brown `` live at the apollo '' the smooth female d.j interrupts bo diddley groaning `` i 'm a man '' it is a joke here in this baby-blue resort where art is a full-time hobby art is what everyone claims to do women sprawl like cats on each other 's laps licking the salt off each other 's skin and i walk in search of the portuguese fishermen who hide in the scorched trees the bleak blond dunes that line the highway i imagine you asleep in another city i take your poem apart line by line it is a love letter we wrote each other some time ago trying in vain to pinpoint that first easy thrill

there are some people i know whose beauty is a crime who make you so crazy you do n't know whether to throw yourself at them or kill them which makes for permanent madness which could be bad for you you better be on the lookout for such circumstances stay away from the night they most likely lurk in corners of the room where they think they being inconspicuous but they so beautiful an aura gives them away stay away from the day they most likely be walking down the street when you least expect it trying to look ordinary but they so fine they break your heart by making you dream of other possibilities stay away from crazy music they most likely be creating it cuz when you 're that beautiful you ca n't help putting it out there everyone knows how dangerous that can get stay away from magic shows especially those involving words words are very tricky things everyone knows words the most common instruments of illusion they most likely be saying them breathing poems so rhythmic you ca n't help but dance and once you start dancing to words you might never stop
i out of scarcity — ... being because when you were nine your father was murdered betrayed because the traveler was betrayed by those with whom he had the right to seek refuge the tatárs because the universe then allowed a creature stronger taller more ruthless than you to fasten around your neck a thick wooden wheel impossible to throw off because at nine your cunning was not equal to iron-fastened immense wood because stripped of what was his from birth the slave at ten outwitted the universe tore the wheel from his neck — because your neck carries it still scarcity is the mother of being • hour in which betrayal and slavery are the great teachers hour in which acquisition looks like and for a moment is safety hour in which the earth looking into a mirror names what it sees by the history of weapons hour from which i can not wake ii ch ’ ang-ch ’ un was determined that he would not prostrate himself before the conqueror of the world though alexander the great drunk had executed aristotle ’ s nephew when he refused to grovel before his uncle ’ s pupil • ch ’ ang-ch ’ un bowed his head with clasped hands the great khan was gracious though ch ’ ang-ch ’ un much younger had refused invitations from the king of gold and even the emperor of hang-chou now in his old age he discovered he was tired of waiting for apotheosis at last invited to court by the terrifying conqueror of the world he said yes • he traveled for a year and a half following the route the great khan himself had taken he passed valley after valley that years later still were filled with ungathered whitening bones • he bowed his head with clasped hands the most powerful man on earth then asked him to teach him the secret of the taoist masters — the elixir that allows men to cheat death temujin was in pain temujin for fifty years lived as if immortal — though surrounded all his life by death now he had fallen from a horse the injury had not entirely after much time healed he brooded about death his death now he must conquer the ancient secret that would bend heaven to his need he asked ch ’ ang-ch ’ un for the fabled elixir iii the world he was born at the great world ’ s poor far edge in order to see the rich debris that must lie at the bottom of the sea he sucked and sucked till he swallowed the ocean • buddhists taoists muslims nestorians — he summoned each each eloquent spokesman praised abnegations offered transformation even ecstasies — just renounce sex or food or love • eating power he fucked a new woman every night best he said was the wife or daughter or mother of an enemy • he watched his friend bo ’ orchu hunt each day as if hunting were the purpose of life work sufficient for a man as a boy he discovered his work when he had a wooden wheel around his neck to escape the wheel every single thing tastes like reeks with the power that put it there weapons keep in place who gets rewarded how much for what the world • is good at telling itself this is a lie the world iv each unit made up of ten ten soldiers whose leader reports to a unit of one hundred soldiers whose leader reports to a unit of one thousand soldiers whose leader reports to a unit of ten thousand with iron logic he had raised the great structure from the flat internecine earth — abyss where absolute necessary power is fettered bewildered by something working within us mud in the veins to paralyze decision — as well as by that necessary sweet daring that leaps across the abyss to risk all to correct and cripple power — ... but then finds in despair it must try to master it v though temujin ’ s father alive was khan the remnant of his family was at his poisoning driven from the circle of the wagons temujin had shining eyes but at nine no force they survived by eating roots berries stray rodents birds the boys ’ cunning pulled from the air • temujin ’ s father out of his mother had two sons his poisoned father out of his second wife also had two sons • one day with a freshly sharpened juniper arrow he brought down a lark and his half-brother bekter nearly his age reaching the bird first refused to give it up temujin ran to his mother who told him he must accept this that four boys with two women alone must cease fighting with his bow and arrow the next day temujin murdered his half-brother • his half-brother at each moment relentlessly disputed and clearly forever would dispute everything temujin possessed • when he confessed to his mother she shrieked only his shadow ever again could bear to be with him he didn ’ t believe her she lived blinded by panic he looked around him human beings live by killing other living beings • his father ’ s rival who told his father that temujin had shining eyes when his father died decided he now could make temujin a slave temujin rammed the wheel down on the idiot guard ’ s skull sorqan-shira and his sons found him drowning among reeds at the edge of the river frenzied risking their lives sorqan-shira and his sons work to cut away the wheel from his body • the arrow flew as if of itself temujin ’ s half-brother turned and saw temujin ’ s unerring aim aimed at his chest before the arrow was released his half-brother did not beg to live his half-brother ’ s gaze was filled with everything that would happen would happen • in the delirium of temujin ’ s adult dreams the knife he stole escaping is useless in unlocking the wheel • how each child finds that it must deal with the intolerable becomes its fate • w o r l d with this a r r o w i thee wed. vi even the conqueror of the world is powerless against the dead the most intricate plan his friend jamuqa ever accomplished was to make temujin execute him • they met as boys by the frozen waters of the onon temujin gave jamuqa the knucklebone of a deer jamuqa gave temujin the knucklebone of a deer they could see their breaths they mingled breaths they swore they were anda brothers they sharpened arrows — juniper cypress • when they met again many years later temujin ’ s wife borte had been seized by another tribe jamuqa commanded a whole tribe he pledged his friend twenty thousand men temujin also by this time was chief but of many fewer the two friends and two armies found and freed borte after nine months the anda celebrated by the waters of the onon • they were too drunk too happy jamuqa pulled a blanket over himself and temujin they lay all night under the same blanket • for either to have expressed desire to have reached would have been to offer the object of desire power it could not be done • jamuqa forever wants them to do it to them together in tandem two couples next to each other — so temujin can and must look over and see his insouciant bravado as he dismounts hear jamuqa ’ s girl cry out first more jaggedly • when the chiefs gather to choose for the first time in decades a great khan to jamuqa ’ s surprise temujin is chosen someone points out his family is royal — jamuqa is merely descended from a favorite concubine • at feasts jamuqa thinks supplicants shuffle him aside to reach temujin as the world more and more defers to temujin jamuqa becomes in his own eyes a ghost he is the memory of jamuqa • in the new army under temujin aristocracy has few privileges a friend who has fought under jamuqa for years must to rise compete against peasants panache the sweet disdain for mere consequences gain victory is lost • many like the tribe that tried to enslave him will never accept temujin whenever a new group rebels temujin finds jamuqa is in their company • men don ’ t want to serve under jamuqa — because his friend would not fight against the great khan he cut off the friend ’ s head and hung it from his horse ’ s tail • jamuqa joined the nayman army jamuqa deserted the nayman army • an outcast with five last remaining followers jamuqa in the high snowy tangu mountains at the very limit of his native country as he eats a wild ram he has killed and roasted is taken prisoner by his companions and delivered to temujin vii your father seized your mother as a girl just after her marriage to someone from her own tribe this was common practice just after your marriage the same tribe seized your wife and gave her to the brother of the chief all proceeded from desire — from deferred justice the chancre of unclosed injury this bred enmity through generation after generation blood feuds tribe against tribe against tribe as the great khan temujin outlawed such seizures he did what was there to be done • the axes of your work work that throughout the illusory chaos of your life absorbed your essential mind were there always — what was there to be done you saw many men refuse or try to refuse what needed to be done whether they could not find it or were finding it disgusted they without it wandered like jamuqa • when temujin entered the dark room the prisoner was naked his genitals hung pendant bulbous — as if swollen from rubbing he still is a creature that is beautiful but all dirty • jamuqa said what you must do is kill me i will never accede to your power alive i will rally your enemies dead i will in their eyes just be one more fool temujin replied that he could not they had been since boyhood anda without him would he have recovered borte jamuqa replied that he did not want his skin broken during execution he repeated twice i will never accede to your power temujin refused jamuqa was sick in the head healthy men don ’ t want to die • jamuqa escaped two men who temujin valued died bringing him back then jamuqa escaped again when jamuqa was returned again temujin hesitated for months then he granted his wish • he insisted the skin not be broken when he saw the body the head was severed as if someone for some reason had been furious • temujin was furious with him for letting pride some sickness of the mind poison feeling — ... they had been since boyhood anda • even the conqueror of the world is powerless against the dead he saw smelt the carcass of jamuqa — ... who had known that temujin was too smart not to be by his death forever tormented • he watched you take from him what he thought was his — the world of indolent chaos inhabited by the beautiful and lucky — fuck anything that walks if that is whatever inside you demands in the end the something that was broken in him was mute he insisted that it did not exist viii there was an immense silence between temujin and borte • in the beginning sweetness because there had been no need to talk • temujin ’ s father had taken him at nine on a journey to find temujin a bride • she was ten and beautiful • his father and her father were old allies and it was agreed • on the way home the tatárs poisoned his father • temujin was sixteen when they were at last married • within days borte was abducted • borte was abducted because when their camp was attacked there was only one free horse • temujin thrust the horse at his mother not his wife • this was as it should be • borte knew this accepted this • when she returned from those who had seized her she returned about to give birth • temujin did not ask what humiliations she had endured • whose child was it • it could have been temujin ’ s or the creature ’ s who took her • temujin declared the child a son his • he needed to be perceived among his own people as someone of impeccable justice • someone whose rectitude is above vanity • they had three more sons • he needed legitimate sons • borte raised as well orphans that temujin ’ s soldiers plucked from burning villages that they themselves had burned • those thus saved proved to be among the fiercest the most loyal of his soldiers • after borte returned the armies of temujin and jamuqa camped together for a year and a half • borte and temujin ’ s mother found the closeness between the two men humiliating an insult an embarrassment • borte and temujin ’ s mother told temujin that as long as he was tied to this debauched fickle friendship the other chiefs never would choose temujin as the great khan • it was the first month of spring • the two armies had to move off to fresh grazing • temujin furious listened to the two women as if he were a statue • he heard jamuqa say that camp pitched on the slopes of the mountain gave the herders of horses what they wanted but camp pitched on the banks of the river was better for the herders of sheep • the women said that when night fell and jamuqa ’ s wagon stopped to pitch camp temujin ’ s wagon should continue • temujin ’ s wagon as jamuqa ’ s wagon stopped to pitch camp on a mountainside continued • as the night passed the clans realized what was happening and frightened debated to stop with jamuqa or stop with temujin • schisms within a tribe even sometimes within a clan • one shaman dreamt that a cow white as snow struck at jamuqa ’ s wagon until it broke one of its horns bellowing that jamuqa had to give back its lost horn striking the ground with its hoof • the shaman dreamt that a white bull followed temujin ’ s wagon bellowing that heaven and earth have decided the empire should be temujin ’ s • when temujin heard this he promised the shaman thirty concubines • as day broke and temujin at last stopped count could be taken of which clans followed temujin and which stopped with jamuqa • temujin camped near the sources of the onon • the clans who had chosen temujin in the disorder and uncertainty of the night now were joined by others • they had weighed the situation • temujin was famous for the care and probity of his decisions • the princes of the royal blood joined temujin • many days passed before temujin looked directly at borte when they spoke • she was the vehicle of necessity • of what had to be • he would not forgive her • in time he lost interest in forgiving her • when he returned from his last long campaign which lasted eight unbroken years he was grateful she did not ask about each night ’ s new woman • in time near the sources of the onon the princes of the royal blood elected temujin great khan • fame clung to the story of how he saved the beautiful borte • the irony was not lost on borte that as mother of orphans she was married to the force that made them orphans ix only at the age of thirty-nine temujin at last was master of all mongolia the emissaries of the kings of gold had played tribe against tribe all his life to castrate them to achieve unity to achieve the empire essential to maintain unity half the tribes had to be massacred • the tatárs killed his father then after subduing them followed by their unending involuted betrayals and rebellions temujin without sorrow exterminated them every male standing higher than a wagon axle was killed the rest enslaved • extermination is not a question of vengeance it is a question of safety of not allowing what happened to happen • under temujin the mongols crossed the great wall that the kingdom of gold over centuries built to contain them before them the lush cultivated great plain stretched five hundred miles — ... from beijing to nanking • between the mongols and the kings of gold lay a trench of blood inexpiable wrongs fifty years earlier betraying tatárs handed off the mongol khan ambaqay to beijing ’ s king of gold — ... who impaled him on a wooden ass • temujin drummed into his troops past atrocities after they took huai-lai the ground for some ten miles around was for years still strewn with human bones • the full fury of the mongols was reserved for the great cities of islam their sultan had twice murdered temujin ’ s emissaries — what rose in temujin was the rage to annihilate not just the civilization that insulted him but what made it possible ... in the end there was little left for his tax collectors in the future to tax this was a world everywhere on the edge of desert — the mongols in fury dismantled the intricate networks that preserved and gathered and channeled water without dams without the multitudinous screens of trees that were the handiwork of centuries for samarkand for the cities of scheherazade not just defeat but dismemberment • nightmare from which not even the rich awoke • ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... stonework of hive-like intrication its hard face airy as lace indifferent hooves erased to sand x ch ’ ang-ch ’ un thought if he answered honestly he would be executed he asked temujin to tell him temujin ’ s story the great khan to his own surprise wasn ’ t offended he liked the earnest old man seized suddenly absorbed with relish he began to tell the old man his story omitting nothing he imagined essential the taoist master at last answered that there exists no elixir for eternal life he told him that the largest square has no corners he told him that they go east and west at the will of the wind so that in the end they know not if the wind carries them or they the wind but as temujin listened to his own voice tell his story the lineaments of his story this is what he heard — because you could not master whatever enmeshed you you became its slave — you learned this bitterly early in order not to become its slave you had to become its master you became its master even as master of course you remain its slave • a s h. what yesterday was the lockstep logic of his every position purity in which he took just pride cunning solutions to what the universe thrust at him appeared to him now ash not his or if his not his • too often now he woke with his mouth gasping above water the great wooden wheel around his neck now buoy now too heavy to lift jamuqa ’ s face mutilated — jamuqa with whom he lay under the same blanket the familiar universe began to assume its shape inherent enmity of equals each master not a master a fraud a master slave • his own voice said it • old he included himself in his scorn for those who young want the opposite of this earth then settle for more of it • the life he had not led could not even now lead was a burning-glass between himself and the sun • temujin saw that the taoist master was terrified the old man facing the verge had leapt into the sea — he had given the conqueror of the world simply what he had already he liked the old man after dallying for months discussing the dead surrounding them he allowed him to return to his own country • master slave you who have survived thus far the lottery of who will live and who will die — contemplate genghis khan great ocean khan born temujin master slave xi the death of his grandson mutugen seemed to temujin harbinger of his own death this boy raised in a desert dust-storm was innocent of dust he who made one imagine something undeformed could emerge from deformity died by an arrow that he should die — that he should die assaulting a muslim citadel meant that temujin himself bareheaded took part in the final attack that destroyed it that every living thing therein man and beast the child slain in its mother ’ s womb must die — that no loot no booty should be taken but everything inexorably erased a place thereafter forever accursed • when temujin heard of his grandson ’ s death he learned it before the boy ’ s own father he called all his sons to share a meal and at it announced that he was angry his sons no longer obeyed him jaghatay mutugen ’ s father protested then temujin told jaghatay that the boy was dead gazing fixedly temujin with a choked voice forbade jaghatay grief forbade him not just the signs of grief but grief itself he kept them at table for hours at the end jaghatay when temujin left the room wept • he now knew how he wanted to be buried he wanted the course of the onon temporarily diverted — there at its muddy center burial in a sealed chamber then the river sent back over it any travelers encountering by chance the funeral cortege were to be executed xii imagination clings to apotheosis — ... those who inherit the powerful dead imagine them and cling hero to his people — ... curse except in imagination to everyone else the dream i dreamed was not denied me it was not in the mind denied me • this is the end of the fourth hour of the night

in my house days we ’ re ordinary affectionate a close happy couple but nights require a passport and serious immunizations warnings about security and guerilla attacks you are a foreign ruler quite possibly benevolent in intention – but we know how these things always play out don ’ t we – with needs alien to and hostile to your citizenry me without power except to say “ no more ” and hope to survive the fallout from the battles in the streets days we ’ re the peaceful devoted pair all our friends envy nights are always tense around the dmz that is our bed with occasional forays into the bush where the enemy is always lying in wait sleep is hard fearful and troubled i dream us going down in flames
it ’ s true i almost never smile but that doesn ’ t mean i ’ m not in love my heart is that black violin played slowly you know that moment late in the solo when the voice is so pure you feel the blood in it the wound between rage and complete surrender that ’ s where i ’ m smiling you just can ’ t see it—the sound bleeding perfectly inside me the first time i killed a vampire i was sad i mean we were almost family but that ’ s so many lives ago i believe in the cry that cuts into the melody the strings calling back the forgotten world when i think of the madness that has made me and the midnight i walk inside—all day long when i think of that one note that breaks what ’ s left of what ’ s human in me man i love everything
thinking to see them there captains industrious in morning sun i crack the egg ’ s tender yellow head love comes to me un- ­repentant toward it all vectors converge repeating like moment of the necessary form i pluck a feather from your neck on the page one alights without permission or love is an assemblage beginning each day identical palpable i remarks of is it that music or need edits my body two people leave a shopping mall with goods death squad hovering high a streetlamp call your mother stay up late to watch the neighborhood undressing light like multiple phone calls connected then hung up get the family together soon watch american bison overtake the field filling a vehicle lane in early snow obstructed i paused to see it their dark furs shaking enormous out of trees they descended from the line of sky respond to a much deeper instinct we were then back on our way input later to the search bar i love keywords like love is an exodus i imagine you sleeping then a pyramid or chandelier throwing sunlight an absence emerges sharp i regard the whole practice of it touch it
i remember that first time the empty auditorium her voice the dark all around us her mouth reaching into mine she was freddy ’ s foxy older sister and i didn ’ t know why she wanted to kiss me she had already finished high school and probably shouldn ’ t have been walking the halls but she always called me her friend so one monday after gym i found myself beside myself in front of her house—with my trench coat and lunch bag— probably not looking much like shaft inside the air held warm milk and we talked a bit about her baby and her aunt who paid the rent painting cars maybe she liked me because we were both black and mostly alone in the suburbs but i hadn ’ t thought about that it was her voice that got me—banked fire the color of dusk—her voice and my name was smoke in her mouth i think about it more than i should now that january noon—an hour before algebra—how most days i ’ d be thinking football or replaying the seventy-some kisses i ’ d gotten over those lean years but that day donna and me were on the couch munching potato chips rrruffles have rrridges she kidded coming from checking the baby who ’ d slipped into a nap i was kind of disappointed that we hadn ’ t done anything but i needed time to get back to school so i started to stand she said wait look at this mess and with her left hand she brushed the crumbs from my lap the way you ’ d whisk away lint— then swept over my pants again— to be thorough i guessed but slower and then some more as if her hand were getting drowsy you know how sometimes you see something but just can ’ t believe it—like a squirrel bobbling a biscuit on your kitchen counter or a cricket creeping the red feathers of your mother ’ s sunday hat her hand there on my lap could easily have been a five-fingered flying saucer from the fifth dimension for awhile i just watched and wondered if she knew where her hand had landed but it was me who didn ’ t know me with my six dozen kisses and the great eden of my virginity how do we not talk about it every day the ways we were changed by the gift in someone ’ s touch—your body suddenly a bright instrument played by an otherwise silent divinity when i heard my zipper i couldn ’ t have said where my arms were or what a clock was for i had no idea i could be such a stranger and still be myself how could i have known what a girl might do to a boy with her mouth if she felt like doing what her mouth could do it was a kind of miracle the dreamed impossible—my soul finally called to my flesh i didn ’ t know what i didn ’ t know and then i knew
i used to think that if i loved hard enough and long enough passion would always win out like the way i loved cologne venturing teenaged into congested malls abusing testers only a salesperson surly enough inquiring if he or she could help me in any way spitting the prices of even the smallest bottles of the scents i had slathered on forcing me out in a cloud of confidence that i was the calvin klein man not the old spice man not the zest man and certainly not the my drafty house is warmed badly by kerosene heaters man impervious to my real life where i would sneak down in the middle of the night passing snow collecting on the inside of the window sill trying to descend the stairs silently to complete the night lying before the stove ’ s vents blowing sooty warm air deep into my sleeping lungs clutching a broken lacrosse stick to intimidate rats so brazen our housecats accepted them as equal occupants until i exit those automatic doors leave fountains where just out of range i envy white families tossing entire cigarette packs ’ worth of what they call spare change wishing for things they could already buy if they wanted laughing as those presidential faces fall sometimes up and sometimes down all drowning in three inches of chlorinated well water return to the reservation where my sister- in-law embraces me later the same day drawing deeply saying she loves the scent of burned heating oil on men that it reminds her of when she and my brother dated and she would hold him long in those last moments before allowing him to walk out her door meander through snowy grooves finding his way home while she looked out windows where ice crystals gathered on the proper side of the pane holding her breath as long as she dared letting his presence seep out only when she could no longer bear leaving him to be a vapor ghost on her window a fog sure to vanish even before she turned from the window and here i am years later living in that same state you miles away and i knowing how presence disperses into air wonder how long i can hold my breath
the late gracie allen was a very lucid comedienne especially in the way that lucid means shining and bright what her husband george burns called her illogical logic made a halo around our syntax and ourselves as we laughed george burns most often was her artful inconspicuous straight man he could move people about stage construct skits and scenes write and gather jokes they were married as long as ordinary magic would allow thirty-eight years until gracie allen 's death in her fifties gracie allen developed a heart condition she would call george burns when her heart felt funny and fluttered he 'd give her a pill and they 'd hold each other till the palpitation stopped—just a few minutes many times and pills as magic fills then fulfilled must leave a space one day gracie allen's heart fluttered and hurt and stopped george burns said unbelievingly to the doctor `` but i still have some of the pills ''

seaside and the fragment of one running— calves ribs green eyes into water there he goes waves buoying up as into sky and the seagulls fly seeing it as relief a story once they were there two on a white blanket the circumference of a shadow sunlight around that shadow the relation of two bathers robed figures configured as one and she touches him—tender—and it is done i 've gone back to it i 've i've— it 's not where i am i give it away again you 're there it 's still in the sand it 's trying to chisel it in how it comes forth the story wanting it carving it down to vision architecture a coliseum of bent light the beautiful scatter of broken stones and i can turn it into stones love love a portico a labyrinth and his simple aquatics legs and arms in the brackish etched against white fish the song under there of how he 'll leave and naturally like all living things animals summer daylight for the eves and the buildings all shadows and beings block angels curves with the love memory of all loves the pediments these reliquaries it 's our landscape artifact—it might hurt run to run away from it
to watch you walk cross the room in your black corduroys is to see civilization start— the wish- whish-whisk of your strut is flint striking rock—the spark of a length of cord rubbed till smoke starts—you stir me like coal and for days smoulder i am no more a boy scout and besides could never put you out—you keep me on all day like an iron out of habit— you threaten brick- house to burn all this down you leave me only a chimney

1. it is cold enough for rain to coagulate and fall in heavy drops tonight a skin of ice will grow over the bones of the smallest bush making it droop like the wrist of someone carrying a heavy suitcase this moving on from season to season is exhausting and violent the break from the berlin wall of winter especially like a frostbitten hand coming to life i color first with warmth then with pain thawing letting the great powers go their own way in rivers and in flesh frightens me as this day warns me of an icy night 2. each year i am astonished at the havoc wrought on other lives fathers made tiny by cancer a mother swollen around a bad heart `` brought on by aggravation '' to suffer is to do something new yet always the same— a change of life from the sexual dread some women wish they were men some men wish they were dead still there is coin in suffering it makes us rich as croesus in his golden tears and we are rarely hated for it this coin i store in a purse made of my mother's milk and flesh which god says i must not mix i use it instead to seek pleasure 3. walking around with this thing in me all day this loving cup full of jelly waiting for you to come home—seven o'clock eight o'clock eight-thirty what could be more important than love i ca n't imagine you can not a good day not about to get better 4. the bird comes complete with heart liver and neck-bone wrapped chastely in white paper still half-frozen the legs are hard to separate inside wax paper sticks to the ribs i reach like a vet delivering pigs or a boy finger-fucking a virgin 5. air the same sweet temperature inside the house as outside the house stepping up from the cellar with an armful of sheets i listen for the dirge of flies under the chittering birds both painfully loud there is a stridency that 's stubborn in a life grown by inches the fat little fingers of buds bursting ugly ducklings the slow war of day against night as i pin the swelling sheets with clothespins damp and too narrow at the mouth i wonder how flies know to come out to feed the birds and feast themselves on the new stillborn this stubborn great chain of being
one morning you open one eye and listing to the south it bulks like a barn noiseless derelict planks horizontal and deeply grooved a rudder the size of your front door pivots as you push once inside you can smell the fear of every winged creeping and four-legged thing no water no straw just shadow and bare wood where is the one promised to wake beside you forever ox-eyed daisies goldenrod clover— why are you breathing among them why do n't you gather the outcast beasts or become one ...
it seems a certain fear underlies everything if i were to tell you something profound it would be useless as every single thing i know is not timeless i am particularly risk-averse i choose someone else over me every time as i 'm sure they 'll finish the task at hand which is to say that whatever is in front of us will get done if i 'm not in charge of it there is a limit to the number of times i can practice every single kind of mortification of the flesh i can turn toward you and say yes it was you in the poem but when we met you were actually wearing a shirt and the poem was n't about you or your indecipherable tattoo the poem is always about me but that one time i was in love with the memory of my twenties so i was for a moment in love with you because you remind me of an approaching subway brushing hair off my face with its hot breath darkness and then light the exact goldness of dawn fingering that brick wall out my bedroom window on smith street mornings when i 'd wake next to godknowswho but always someone who was n't a mistake because what kind of mistakes are that twitchy and joyful even if they 're woven with a particular thread of regret the guy who used my toothbrush without asking i walked to the end of a pier with him would have walked off anywhere with him until one day we both landed in california when i was still young and going west meant taking a laptop and some clothes in a hatchback and learning about produce i can turn toward you whoever you are and say you are my lover simply because i say you are and that is i realize a tautology but this is my poem i claim nothing other than what i write and even that i 'd leave by the wayside since the only thing to pack would be the candlesticks and even those are burned through thoroughly replaceable who am i kidding i don't own anything worth packing into anything we are cardboard boxes you and i stacked nowhere near each other and humming different tunes it is too late to be writing this i am writing this to tell you something less than neutral which is to say i 'm sorry it was never you it was always you your unutterable name this growl in my throat

you love your friend so you fly across the country to see her your friend is grieving when you look at her you see that something ’ s missing you look again she seems all there reading glasses sarcasm leather pumps what did you expect ruins demeter without arms in the british museum your friend says she believes there ’ s more pain than beauty in the world when persephone was taken demeter damned the world for half the year the other half remained warm and bountiful the greeks loved symmetry on the plane the man next to you read a geometry book the lesson on finding the circumference of a circle on circumference you can calculate the way around if you know the way across you try across with your friend you try around i don ’ t believe in an afterlife she says but after k. died i thought i might go after her in case i ’ m wrong in case she ’ s somewhere waiting
that she was not pretty she knew the flowers delivered into her hands post-concert by the young girl pretty would be acknowledged only to display was to invite comparison skilled at withholding she withheld it was a kind of giving as when meditation is a kind of action a way of leaning into music the way one leans into winter wind the way a mule leans into a harness the way a lover leans into the point of deepest penetration after a ship ’ s prow cuts the water the water rushes back twice as hard

the process of through is ongoing the earth doesn ’ t seem to move but sometimes we fall down against it and seem to briefly alight on its turning we were just going i was just leaving which is to say coming elsewhere transient i was going as i came the words move through my limbs lungs mouth as i appear to sit peacefully at your hearth transubstantiating some wine it was a rough red it was one of those nights we were not forced by circumstances to drink wine out of mugs circumstances being in those cases no one had been transfixed at the kitchen sink long enough to wash dishes i brought armfuls of wood from the splitting stump many of them because it was cold went right on top of their recent ancestors it was an ice night they transpired visibly resin to spark bark to smoke wood to ash i was transgendering and drinking the rough red at roughly the same rate and everyone who looked saw the translucence of flames beat against the air against our skins this can be done with or without clothes on this can be done with or without wine or whiskey but never without water evaporation is also ongoing most visibly in this case in the form of wisps of steam rising from the just washed hair of a form at the fire whose beauty was in the earth ’ s turning that night and many nights transcendent i felt heat changing me the word for this is transdesire but in extreme cases we call it transdire or when this heat becomes your maker we say transire or when it happens in front of a hearth transfire
these grapes of stone were being proffered friend — john berryman grapes rough-touched and round stone- carved to be squeezed into the fundaments of rock wine she imagines it would be cold not sought for its smoothness and likely full of grit if not refined with care the satyr laughs carelessly for one caught in stone the cracked edges of his mouth spill grit as he leers after the loss of his fundaments which fall along the smooth cold torso plane exhibiting immaculate coolness at this literal loss of face carefully she strokes his head as if smoothing the fetlocks handcrafted from stone her affection is unforced a fundamental attraction to those beautiful gritty things made lovely by decay their gritted teeth so much more interesting than the art gallery ’ s cold geometrics which appear fundamental but fail to consider the careless chaos spinning at the stone center of all smooth creations and those grapes their unsmooth surface mirrors the messy passion flushing the grit- dusted cheek the hideous mouth of crumbling stone what heat from the dionysian ’ s cold brittle fruit the obliteration of all care if she could only perform the fundamental act of eating she thinks about wilderness fun mental liberation dancing her soles smooth pleasure as pervasive as care is now her feet a frenzied blur on the gritty forest floor shaking and pummeling out the cold as she prances over starlit stones she does not care who sees her as she grips the stone grapes feels the smooth crumbling cold enter her hand fingers embracing a thing more fundamental than earth bone grit
for carolina ebeid we enrolled at barbizon knowing full well we ’ d never look like what was promised cue carol of the bells cue a demo on the casio and the security of two-way escalators setting the speed those early mornings in our mall school the store ’ s silver grills some mannequins left half-clothed we ’ d taunt them with our imagined summers in london paris rome we weren ’ t please and thank you walking with books on our heads no we were going to devastate greek shipping heirs at every port of call yet when our bus broke down and we trudged the shoulder of highways single file dodging cigarette butt and horn we shook off those mornings studied their defenseless indifference the blinding surface the quality of electric without being alive we knew that there in only hot pants the ideal form plastic most would take a bullet for while at 16 we were already trash-talking our prayers never went beyond the second floor light-years away from the last word that distant somewhere where a boat loses course the north star forsaking its name to another
i was sitting in old town square with tourists and birds and i was reading foucault how “ he who is subjected to a field of visibility ... becomes the principle of his own subjection ” and all around me the beautiful czechoslovakian boys moved through the first day of spring like perennially visible inmates in the opening credits of a prison porno the sun reflected off the glass and my table was an inscrutable tower of light from which i peered invisibly at the swan-graceful boys who seemed to skirr across the stones traveling it seemed to something vaguely ridiculous and charmingly anachronistic cuff link shopping or brunch with the duchess the coffee had made me jittery and i was beginning to sweat from both sun and desire i considered moving to the outer edge of the circled tables so the boys could see me as i could see them but then the 600-year-old orloj sounded the hour and the twelve apostles and skeletal death spun around and i was afraid to leave my tower i didn ’ t want to be visible in the way those small dancing figures were visible and as much as i wanted a handsome companion i feared my foot getting caught in a sewer grate or my spoon falling from my saucer and clattering on the pavement startling the birds into a ruckus an errant ball of sweat fell from my chin and onto the page i looked down to where it had landed on the word “ reciprocal ” which made me think how looking is always reducible to twos — two eyes two parties two possible outcomes and how those who watch from the panopticon ’ s black pupil may in any case not even exist
moissac france i walked to the baker ’ s and thought about the bread and at the corner store the butter four kinds of butter i bought them in order of saltiness i studied slang in secret i said little and my students were so beautiful i couldn ’ t teach a thing instead i made them sing twenty-two nothing to do new york had vanished connecticut too my students grew hair and got haircuts grew hair and got haircuts and sang i ’ d lie in bed and masturbate and wonder why i ’ d come and come and come again and then rise for some bread and a run does the village persist it must right now someone hums “ nowhere man ” and thinks of that shy teacher from — manhattan new orleans bel air and she brushes her lengthening hair
just when i had long outgrown those late-night seizures in my hand those involuntary impulses return to make my fingers twitch like the tips of twigs after the bird leaps off the branch— what a crafty little devil bouncing back all feathered and ticklish jittery with pleasure when it finally finds its nest the sheets become as damp as the sweaty shirts that cling to the backs of men at the dance and how i pity the girls who undress their lovers before sex when i started loving other bodies instead allowing other temporary guests to mold their shapes inside my flesh— a torso of my arm a shoulder of my mouth a waist or a buttock of my leg—i had no need to concentrate my rapture to a single sticky place since every movement in my skin was slowing down inside the vat of honey i was swimming in oh bath with tongue oh alchemy of heat and bed the memory of so much sex enough to keep me sated in the quieter evenings of my third and final age so imagine my surprise when those possessions from my adolescence woke me up again but in the guise of scribbling from my pen not fancy or confession but something in the middle like the mole that snuggles in the space between my breasts that glorious discovery that makes the men cry out the women shudder with anticipation or intent it 's more like poetry because it whistles through the paper like the weekend afternoons i summoned passersby from behind the window 's curtain what wonder to seduce with sound granting serendipitous fantasy—here a table with rotating thighs there a closet panting with exhaustion there the eye of the voyeuristic clock bold and looking to be satisfied with one pair of feet pointing at two opposite corners of the room three fingers always vanishing inside the cluster of four hands that motion slowly left slowly right— the capricious current of the underwater flower five limbs comparing lengths and flexibility their competition sabotaged by the arrival of a sixth contender seven escalating levels in the throat— whimper grunt moan sigh whine hum groan cry—oh and if we 're lucky thinks the grinning clock we will spiral up the scale and down again a good eight times nine would be too much to ask though not impossible since there was once a record-breaking tenth remember eleven minutes for a quickie at least twelve positions for a marathon now why would i write a thing like that me who wears a garter belt to church on sundays my best perfume to market where tomatoes look as dazed as the tomato seller blame it on my mother 's poor choice for a compadre none other than the legendary lover the mortician whom the women always said would have his way with one in life or in death—both if one was fortunate and the rumor always was that he had fathered me though i never did detect any resemblance but what does it matter anymore i 've outlived even the mortician 's crazy daughter half-sister if the hearsay is correct if the mortician is my muse then let him color every word in ink as dark as pubic hair where to begin ah yes fittingly at the little piece of skin that stimulates imagination i 'll compose a poem to the mortician 's scar
beijing i could still hear the musicians cajoling those thousands of clay horses and horsemen through the squeeze when i woke beside carlotta life-size also also terra-cotta the sky was still a terra-cotta frieze over which her grandfather still held sway with the set square fretsaw stencil plumb line and carpenter 's pencil his grandfather brought from roma proud-fleshed carlotta hypersarcoma for now our highest ambition was simply to bear the light of the day we had once been planning to seize baginbun the nashville skyline 's hem and haw as the freebooters who freeboot through their contractual mire and murk like normans stampeding dozens of cows into their norse-irish cousins were balking now at this massive breastwork they themselves had thrown up the pile of toot on a mirror the hip-hirple of a white horse against purple age-old traductions i could trace from freebasers pretending they freebase to this inescapable flaw hidden by carlotta 's close-knit wet suit like a heart-wound by a hauberk bannockburn though he was mounted on a cob rather than a warhorse the bruce still managed to sidestep a spear from henry de bohun and tax de bohun 's poll with his broad-based poleax and leave de bohun 's charger somewhat leer her grandfather had yet to find a use for the two-timing partisan his grandfather brought man-to-man against all those ferdinandies until he saw it might come in handy for whacking the thingammybobs off pine and fir off pine and fir and spruce and all such trees as volunteer berwick-upon-tweed off the elm the ancient pollard that a flemish painter might love that comes to shun the attention of its headstrong days so is proof against the storm that takes its neighbor 's roof her nonno collects his pension knowing that when push really came to shove he had it within him to wrap his legs in puttees and backslap those pack mules down that moonlit deck carlotta now wearing a halter-neck under the long-sleeved high-collared wet suit whereof whereof whereof whereof i needs must again make mention blaye her wet suit like a coat of mail worn by a french knight from the time a knight could still cause a ruction by direct-charging his rouncy when an englishman 's home was his bouncy castle when abduction and seduction went hand in glove now carlotta would climb from the hotel pool in nashville take off her mask and set a spill to a gauloise as one might set a spill to the fuse of a falconet and the walls of her chest assail the french meanwhile were still struggling to prime their weapons of mass destruction bosworth field it was clear now through the pell-mell of bombard- and basilisk-mist that the stanleys had done the dirt on him and taken henry 's side now richard 's very blood seemed to have shied away from him seemed to sputter and spurt like a falcon sheering off from his wrist as he tried to distance himself from the same falchioneer who 'd pelf the crown from his blood-matted brow and hang it in a tree less clear was how he 'd managed not to crack the shell of the pigeon egg the size of a cyst he 'd held so close inside his shirt blackwater fort as i had held carlotta close that night we watched some xenophon embedded with the 5th marines in the old sunni triangle make a half-assed attempt to untangle the ghastly from the price of gasoline there was a distant fanfaron in the nashville sky where the wind had now drawn itself up and pinned on her breast a texaco star `` why '' carlotta wondered `` the house of tar might it have to do with the gross imports of crude oil bush will come clean on only when the tigris comes clean '' benburb those impromptu chevaux-de-frise into which they galloped full tilt and impaled themselves have all but thrown off their balance the banner- bearing scots determined to put manners on the beech mast- and cress- and hazelnut- eating irish however jerry-built those chevaux-de-frise have embogged the horses whose manes they had hogged so lovingly and decked with knots of heather horses rooted to the spots on which they go down on their knees as they unwind their shoulder plaids and kilts the checkered careers of their guts boyne the blood slick from the horse slaughter i could no longer disregard as carlotta surfaced like barm my putting her through her paces as she kicked and kicked against the traces like a pack mule kicking from a yardarm before it fell heehaw in the dockyard a banner 's frittering tassel or deflating bouncy castle was something to which she paid heed whereas that vision of a milk-white steed drinking from a tub of water and breathing hard breathing a little hard had barely set off an alarm blenheim small birds were sounding the alert as i followed her unladen steed through a dell so dark and dank she might have sported the waders her grandfather had worn at the nadir of his career scouring the outer banks for mummichog and menhaden those weeks and months in the doldrums coming back as he ran his thumb along an old venetian blind in the hope that something might come to mind that he might yet animadvert the maiden name of that iron maiden on which he was drawing a blank bunker hill carlotta took me in her arms as a campfire gathers a branch to itself her mouth a cauter set to my bleeding bough heehaw her grandfather sterilizing his saw in a tub of 100-proof firewater a helper standing by to stanch the bleeding in some afterlife no looking daggers at the knife she 'd meet the breast-high parapet with the nonchalance the no fucking sweat of a slightly skanky schoolmarm though the surgeon was preparing to ganch her like what's-his-face 's daughter brandywine i crouched in my own little ease by the pool at the vanderbilt where carlotta crouched sputter-sput just as she had in the scanner when the nurse keen-sighted as a lanner picked out a tumor like a rabbit scut on dark ground it was as if a fine silt white sand or silicate had clogged her snorkel her goggles had fogged and carlotta surfaced like flot to be skimmed off some great cast-iron pot as garble is skimmed off or lees painstakingly drained by turnings and tilts from a man-size barrel or butt badli-ke-serai pork barrels pork butts the wide-screen surround sound of a massed attack upon the thin red cellulose by those dust- or fust- or must-cells that cause the tears to well and well and well at which i see him turning up his nose as if he 'd bitten on a powder-pack like yet another sad sepoy who wo n't fall for the british ploy of greasing with ham the hammer or smoothing over carlotta 's grammar '' on which on which bush will come clean '' her grandfather a man who sees no lack of manhood in the lachrymose bull run while some think there 's nothing more rank than the pool that 's long stood aloof from the freshet i loved the smell of sweat and blood and sí horse dung carlotta shouldered like an aqua-lung as she led me now through that dewy dell and spread her house of tartan waterproof as we lay there i could have sworn as i stared through unruffled thorns that were an almost perfect fit to each side of the gravel pit where she and i 'd tried to outflank each other i traced the mark of a hoof or horseshoe in her fontanelle bronkhorstspruit i traced the age-old traduction of a stream through a thorn thicket as a gush from a farthingale skeffington 's daughter skeffington attention shun attention shun shun shun we lay in a siding between two rails and watched an old white horse cross the picket of himself and trek through the scrub to drink from an iron-hooped tub with the snore-snort of a tuba his winkers and bellyband said scuba while his sudden loss of suction carlotta knew meant a pump whose clicket's failed in the way a clicket fails basra '' the way to relieve the tension on the line to a windjammer is to lubricate the bollard so it 's always a little slack '' her nonno giving us the inside track on how the mule drivers whooped and hollered on the dock no respite from his yammer on boundlessness being a bind and the most insidious kind of censorship self-censorship while he took carlotta for a quick whip through conjugation declension and those other `` crannies of the crammer '' in which she 'd been `` quite unscholared '' bazentin as i was bringing up her rear a young dragoon would cock a snook at the gunners raking the knob of high wood tongue like a scaldy in a nest had n't a garibaldi what might lie behind that low-level throb like a niggle in her appointment book dust fust must the dragoon nonplussed by his charger taking the rust and despite her recalcitrance carlotta making a modest advance when the thought of a falchioneer falling to with his two-faced reaping hook now brought back her grandfather 's job beersheba now summoned also the young turk who had suddenly arisen from that great pile of toot heehaw as from one of beersheba 's wells like the sail that all of a sudden swells on the yawl that all of a sudden yaws a wind finding meaning in a mizzen and toppling a bouncy castle her grandfather fain to wrastle each pack mule to a rubber mat whereat whereat whereat whereat whereat he would eftsoons get down to work reaching into its wide-open wizen while a helper clamped back its jaws burma her grandfather 's job was to cut the vocal cords of each pack mule with a single swift excision a helper standing by to wrench the mule 's head fiercely to one side and drench it with hooch he 'd kept since prohibition `` why '' carlotta wondered `` that fearsome tool was it for fear the mules might bray and give their position away '' at which i see him thumb the shade as if he were once more testing a blade and hear the two-fold snapping shut of his four-fold brass-edged carpenter 's rule '' and give away their position ''
i do n't want to be alive anymore i do n't want to be alive enough to want that one is not meant to turn on one 's creator with ferocity expendable in only one way or is that exactly how one is meant to turn to burn beyond the love that from beyond being has come to us christ 's ever unhearable and thus always too bearable scream in love and dread we learn to listen for beloved dread coming upon us like a whiplash rain we watch through a window in pain we learn pain sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia there gleams a scalpel blade so clean with meaning so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue that drawing it —in season due — across my own throat there comes not blood but an ancient answering starlight once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice with a view of sky-contempted skyscrapers and lake michigan 's immaculate sewage my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels my soul —deadword die to find it for self-pity there must remain a self ah but even shitting one 's self one still finds one 's self hastening to hide it all from the kind ukranian nearly bearded night nurse fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs my diaphanous shoulders the very air eating me like a late leaf that once i would have flourished for a perishable lover or lonelied like some catpiss poignancy into a poem dead brain living will little pills entangling pain with adoration of it morphine machine whose little beep heavenly bell conjures me to the suddenly more tolerable hallways of hell lovely leila so unsurgically curved disclosing as she leans to clean my lines a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace of a glacier the brain the brain the brain flickering electrically in and out in out— not the mind in which i love my wife whose tightwound nightmind conjures christ in diapers for instance filthy infant or later in a mist of adolescent bad weather bored of wood dogdead judea squawk-box god some restless absurdity of earth she says through which the rest of heaven can come once upon a time i walked through the chemical glamour of a night refinery sparking dangerously without and within for beside me under her underclothes undulated an incarnation of creation 's finest failure moonskin to make a young man wince coupled with stifling innocence still we managed and over the wrought-iron railing of the country club to which neither of us could possibly belong in the moonskinned pool that seemed both to embody and imbibe her we improved and later out on a green to be sixteen when the starshower i thought was mine was mining me for sweat muscle memory to make its own death shine unceasingly inside of me even unto hell we excelled can it be that her last name was really key so much life in this poem so much salvageable and saving love but it is i fear i swear i tear open what heart i have left to keep it from being and beating and bearing down upon me • what rest in faith wrested from grief what truce with truth in bowing down not to the ground of being but simply to the ground affliction flickers distant now like a structure on fire love's reprieve moves through me like a breeze but antlike existence crawls all over me lord and i cry out if you call this vise quiet a cry this riot of needs and genes an i feelingly among the bones and nerves of sounds i make my scathing way failingly in church or in the parked car before work i try to pray what might it mean to surrender to the wonder nothing means not to end with a little flourish of earth not to end • love is the living heart of dread love i love you unto the very edge of being dead • something in us suffering touches teaches first to find little coves in our loves blank nothings wherein we are what we always were — blank nothings — but changed or rearranged as atoms in the random kingdom of things hand we say or eye or hair as if to make ourselves — to stake ourselves — truly there knowing now not to move in time we are moved by tiger-striped tails bloodfine fins some natureless cerulean one would say thinking oneself out of nature something in us suffering touches torches so we may saunter seeingly through an altogether other element as once in the shedd aquarium in chicago i floated a moment with my love and the two new lives borne from us who loved best the eensy green almost unfish more like the stars when you close your eyes and whirl open to the whirling grains so freed from things you fall down laughing at the havoc for me for a long time not the minnows mattered but the pattern after miraculous i did n't think to think all those mite-eyes and animate instants answering at once to my need and to nothing as if my very nerves worked in finally a saving sense something in us touches suffering touching us like the constellations of kinetic quiet that bound us beyond us as right to the wall the girls pressed their still-forming faces through which the wild new schools flew almost too green too blue to stand and i held your hand
you love apples so let ’ s speak of apples say i were to hold you in my hand like an apple round and red and kiss you in bites on the table or under the tree where you dropped tump and you reached up in cool shadow on the grass and bit back crunch god i ’ d laugh knowing dreams ask like this swallow by swallow
when i take my scissors to your shirts i am frightened not that they will whimper but that they won ’ t understand the violence i mean that kind of violence is the other side of love bright as a light-saber and permanent as the angel ’ s swords above eden barring that couple with a final x that violence means a love strong as death once sie ist mein leben you said meaning me and i took those words personally and knocked upon the door of my heart until all its birds flooded to you in a rush— like the iroquois i tugged on our peace-pipe i wrote your name in smoke then went home with my pockets rolling in shining glass beads my pockets so rich with the coin of your country
i want to be a passenger in your car again and shut my eyes while you sit at the wheel awake and assured in your own private world seeing all the lines on the road ahead down a long stretch of empty highway without any other faces in sight i want to be a passenger in your car again and put my life back in your hands
i ’ m jotting down these lines having borrowed a pen from a waitress in this roadside restaurant three rusty pines prop up the sky in the windows my soup gets cold which implies i ’ ll eat it cold soon i too will leave a tip on the table merge into the beehive of travelers and board one of the ferries where there ’ s always a line to the loo and no one knows where the captain is slightly seasick i keep on writing of the wind-rose and lobster traps seagulls if any—and there always are check the air and you ’ ll see them above straw hats and caps the sun at noon glides like a monstrous star- fish through clouds others drink iced tea training binoculars on a tugboat when i finish this letter i ’ ll take a gulp from the flask you gave me for the road in days when i was too young to care about those on the pier who waved goodbye i miss them now cousins in linen dresses my mother you boys in light summer shirts life is too long the compass needle dances everything passes by the ferry passes by ragged yellow shores
it seems insane now but she ’ d be standing soaked in schoolday morning light her loose-leaf notebook flickering at the bus stop and we almost trembled at the thought of her mouth filled for a moment with both of our short names i don ’ t know what we saw when we saw her face but at fifteen there ’ s so much left to believe in that a girl with sunset in her eyes with a kind smile and a bright blue miniskirt softly shading her bare thighs really could be the goddess even the gloss on her lips sighed kiss me and you ’ ll never do homework again some saturdays my ace terry would say “ guess who was buying teaberry gum in the drugstore on stenton ” and i could see the sweet epiphany still stunning his eyes and i knew that he knew that i knew he knew i knew— especially once summer had come and the sun stayed up till we had nothing else to do but wish and wonder about fine sistas in flimsy culottes and those hotpants james brown screamed about crystal berry diane ramsey kim graves and her this was around 1970 vietnam to the left of us black muslims to the right big afros all over my philadelphia we had no idea where we were how much history had come before us—how much cruelty how much more dying was on the way for me and terry it was a time when everything said maybe and maybe being blinded by the beauty of a tenth grader was proof that for a little while we were safe from the teeth that keep chewing up the world i ’ d like to commend my parents for keeping calm for not quitting their jobs or grabbing guns and for never letting up about the amazing “ so many doors open to good students. ” i wish i had kissed delores jepps i wish i could have some small memory of her warm and spicy mouth to wrap these hungry words around i would like to have danced with her to have slow-cooked to a slow song in her sleek toffee arms her body balanced between the temptations ’ five voices and me—a boy anointed with puberty a kid with a b average and a cool best friend i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever understood how lonely i am but i was closer to it at fifteen because i didn ’ t know anything my heart so near the surface of my skin i could have moved it with my hand
my child is sitting cross-legged on the floor reading to herself sometimes she is so full of need i push her to the floor only once i did that and i don ’ t even remember the moment right but i was trying to wipe urine off my leg and she was naughty like a squirrel and jumping and singing and her head slammed into my chin which hurt and even more than that it pissed me off because she ’ s my beautiful child but in that button snap of a moment she was suddenly just one more person and i pushed her away in a way that felt to me like setting her down but awkwardly because of how she was also balancing her feet on my feet as i tried to pour out a bowl of pee from her little potty as a toothbrush dangled foaming from my mouth somewhere in the mess of that morning she ’ d become person enough to in the space between us create force of momentum and then i did not set her down but pushed her and she fell away from it against the wall and was crying because i her mommy pushed her and i know this should be the poem about how i ’ m horrified at myself the poem about what in ourselves we have to live with but in that moment which followed two years of breastfeeding and baby-wearing and sixty-nine hours of natural childbirth and the hemorrhaging and the uncertain operation after which i pumped every two hours careful not to let the cord tangle in the iv even then when she cried and no matter what and no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what i held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know someday you ’ ll cry alone but i held her and ached and leaked and bled too as long as it took of course there ’ ve been nights since but sometimes it feels as if i ’ ve never been asleep again so when i say i pushed my two-year-old against a wall and i don ’ t remember it happening that way but it happened and i did and i ’ ve been wondering a long time now what the limit is and when i would find the end of myself and that day which was yesterday was the end and this day when we played hide-and-seek with daddy and touched bugs and read frog and toad are friends twice together before she read it to herself as i wrote this this is the day that comes after

nous n'irons plus au bois no more walks in the wood the trees have all been cut down and where once they stood not even a wagon rut appears along the path low brush is taking over no more walks in the wood this is the aftermath of afternoons in the clover fields where we once made love then wandered home together where the trees arched above where we made our own weather when branches were the sky now they are gone for good and you for ill and i am only a passer-by we and the trees and the way back from the fields of play lasted as long as we could no more walks in the wood
and the black water under the boats with their pools of bilge rainbowed out like rinds of steak fat the salt thick in my nostrils but pleasant too details i still remember from bishop ’ s poem everything else about it lost at the docks i watched my friend slip in her rubber boots the wide wet planks glossy with mosses you must walk duckfooted to get to the boats the black and orange fishing barrels the air with its tang of rusted metals there are always hooks and anchors to be found nets and scrapings of wood planed by chisel the way my great-grandmother was said to have worked employed as a shipwright on the city ’ s waterways in the ’ 30s according to the newspaper clipping my grandmother photocopies for me each christmas the description of her gunmetal hair and slim torso clad in overalls the hands she held out for the times reporter “ callused ” he noted “ strong as a man ’ s ” does not recall the woman i remember for her farm in bothell before it became a seattle suburb helping me gather raspberries from the long canes she planted by her porch we spent an afternoon together sweating in the same long-sleeved checkered shirts she ’ d sewn us according to the photo i no longer have and can not remember whether is the source or confirmation of this memory only the papery gray-green streaks of road dust on the canes a bowl of chipped porcelain inside of which were raspberries very red very sweet furred like my friend ’ s upper lip i remember between my teeth as we stood on the docks the smell of iron and winter mist her mouth like nothing i have tasted since

it would have been a fine path for a lizard to cross but i saw none brambles and sweet briar grew on the town side poppies and wild grasses on the river too hot for birds the ducks were out in water and mud and frogs were out by the hundreds it seemed saying way way in their deepest voices it was beautiful there but i ’ d seen beauty and its opposite so often that when warmth broke over my skin i remembered winter the way fresh grief undoes you the moment you ’ re fully awake when she turned two i asked my young friend what she would serve at her birthday party and she said tofu and cupcakes when she was three and i was very sad she called and said what are you doing picking flowers she talked in poems like she was dreaming all the time or very old or virginia woolf more often in the first world one wakes from not to the nightmare when i dreamed i lost my love i willed myself awake because i would not survive the pain again even dreaming which is responsible for that mercy doktor the conscious or the un- i want the poppies picked and i want the poppies left where they grow like looking through the window of a moving train at someone walking up a road lined with poplars and being someone walking up a road lined with poplars the train and the trees a shower of petals and bees sun on the glass and the train perpendicular to the road things entirely themselves arriving in the deep double shadows of the grass and passersby

because i go like the professed sinner repentant to the altar of your baptismal flame i am saved despite your sculptor-love whose whimsy kneads and molds and fires then breaks the free-form of my fasting body to make me whole yet thankful i accept these carnal gifts of you eros and wear them as i would flawless jewels how can you know that i have bled the way and back biting the dust to wear your name the wound lies not in your infliction but in my expectations

because it is a pearly evening i am sitting in the window reading a book i have read before branches emphasize their heft and sway over their shadows some kind of extra firmament an ear over the earth 's ear extra as language is to prayer narratives of elsewhere in the eye inside my eye that vision makes when you tell it to when you shut your eyes so hard they hurt you get more vista and less twist of road and then you 're looking at a valley you named yourself and irrigated yourself full of bitterroot magnolia in the clefts of rock sage at last a harvest a desert that belongs to you— the trick to renunciation is starting now the secret of detachment is having already given up a transcript of speech whose cadences are lost the human need for a body to fill in all your body 's deficiencies those clefts and dents already given up the narrative of a life completely altered in the retrospect that knowledge brings and so discredited the point of memory utterly lost that piece of land has always been suitable for a house that nest has never been ready for eight baby birds who top-heavy frightened their own branch and home and scared themselves completely and remarkably away do you hear that it 's the wind negotiating the spine of one leaf it can not decide whether to raise a fragment of an inch duncan writes as a reader struggles with a strong sentence i struggle at certain unmistakable times with what 's furtive and most right when people marry they finish their names i am still listening for mine to begin my spine wants a bicycle to order its work a red bicycle a hill into a heart of a city that holds something i want the pattern of the air around that leaf is like someone tracing my ribcage with his index finger and then walking away who can blame us for wanting other worlds but shall we take them or let them come to us is the spirit just an ear more like a mouth that bites the air and turns it into blood a voice in the next room goes to sleep sleep moves in the branches of the oak become a rootless mass unsung by skeleton or name or height my friend who says she does not believe in paradise believes in rest i believe that or more likely i like to think of her the way she held my name in her small mouth as she held her own name i like to think of anyone who on a night like this would reach towards my ribcage and trace it delicately and walk away
in different cities on different forms of transportation a woman read daniel deronda until the year became the arbitrary pink the calendar chose for the middle of winter and finally she sat in the reference section of the public library finishing daniel deronda for days at a slowing pace between pieces of newspapers and foreign language newspapers whose syntax she enjoyed not understanding and when she did n't anymore she wrote in the margins of daniel deronda for someone who might never see thought of that person who might never see staring equally at the rain equally thinking of her and of nothing in particular outside the news fell apart if one chooses to be shallow or noble or one is born so and if it matters translations are appropriate when nature is dormant or when one has nothing to say or does not know what to say these are three different things but sometimes they are the same it is not wrong to want nice things neither is it wrong to want to be good or to feel that as a physical force of pleasure daniel deronda who does not know who he is who thinks he does and goes away on a boat but the cover is a picture of a woman gambling the air warms outside the reference section and also the rain incomprehensible news whenever a book ends silence as if a stewardship had ceased a person can feel the bones of one 's hands by stretching them if love comes again know better than to speak
there is a music to this sadness in a room somewhere two people dance i do not mean to say desire is everything a cup half empty is simply half a cup how many times have we been there and not there i have seen waitresses slip a night's worth of tips into the jukebox their eyes saying yes to nothing in particular desire is not the point tonight your name is a small thing falling through sadness we wake alone in houses of sticks of straw of wind how long have we stood at the end of the pier watching that water going in the distance the lights curve along tampa bay a wishbone ready to snap and the night riding on that half promise a half moon to light the whole damned sky this is the way things are with us sometimes we love almost enough we say i can do this i can do more than this and faith feeds on its own version of the facts in the end the heart turns on itself like hunger to a spoon we make a wish in a vanishing landscape sadness is one more reference point like music in the distance two people rise from a kitchen table as if to dance what do they know about love
she took the spareribs out of the oven and set them steaming on a plate before leaving her apartment i did n't know how long to wait tore into cold meat when i decided my mother was n't coming back no one knew about the gun she kept in her purse until the authorities called—a .38 caliber pistol with a pearl handle and a trigger even she could easily pull— her car still waiting to be towed from a roadside ditch when they arrived on the scene yesterday morning i was leaning over a kitchen sink my husband upstairs sleeping between his snores muffled under a down comforter and a portable electric heater that kept our bedroom warm i knew i could sob as loud as i wanted without disturbing his dreams at the sports arena between musical acts and clouds of dope i texted my lover a wide-angle shot of the stage— the reception bars on my phone bouncing back and forth between high and low—a text i had to send several times before it went through even though there was a chance his phone would be off or the text get lost for hours in the ether even days the silence is the agony my therapist says it 's not your fault no way for you to have known exactly where your mother was headed then why am i left weeping in my kitchen decades after the fact when i went upstairs and sat beside my husband he could feel the mattress shift beneath our weight even though i felt much lighter after watching translucent ropes of snot lowering down into the sink arms around me when i asked if he was awake knowing that he was n't how many romances get derailed when a text that has been sent fails to go through how many mothers disappear through a kitchen door never to return—the food on the table the last meal they will ever serve my lover texted back where are you now having no idea what i 'd been going through when he texted again wish i was there with you
i like to feel like a champion listening to frankie valli say `` i can't take my eyes off of you '' i feel like new york city is a scale model in my penthouse in north carolina where i study economics capital markets and the world bank i like to look into a scene from the top of a building in my hometown down at the traders who are moving here from new york city because new york city started to be kind of like a losing place for wealth creation now i look down on them and say to myself `` i 'm too big to fail '' i take my keys off of the ledge and walk down the condominium tower overlooking the entire city when i reach the parking deck i open the door of a 1980 mercedes benz 450 sl and coast to a place called high street i 'm at high street knocking back a gin and tonic with three girls i met at the arts technology center conference on the decline of the book we have a laugh about the old guard who make a book bound in glue and then pinch angel dust off our palms at this point i 'm so high i'm like look why do n't we excuse ourselves and go up to my condominium tower i 've just invested 3.5 million dollars in they are like uh we can do that so we pile into my 450 sl and ride to the tower listening to the music of frankie valli transform our night into a piece of artwork nearly there i look around at the arts technology girls and sort of hum to myself i feel like i 've hit a milestone in my evening when we trip into the foyer of my massive penthouse that has those gleaming glass cubes set into the wall you see in miami or miami beach from the cubes a glimmer of the prosperity circling this region pierces the dark in the form of an orange- yellow beam of fluorescent light one of the girls is removing her jewelry and i 'm like no do n't she takes off her clothes instead and lies face down on the carpet at the stereo i play a song by frankie valli the other two are kind of standing around surprised i think by the curtain of paperback books lining the north wall those are only bound books i tell them while i finger the kindle on my coffee table it is the new large kindle and we are looking at a book called boredom by alberto moravia taking turns reading passages from the screen when we get to the part when the boho girl is fucking the protagonist the totally white breast of one of the arts technology girls slips coolly from her blouse pretending not to notice i continue to read in my turn the girl sitting on the other side of me is wearing some totally white string of pearls and she 's removing everything but the pearls i continue to read the screen while the arts technology girls start to make out like i had been planning for them to do ever since we licked angel dust off each other 's palms i get up and go to the stereo set the needle back to the gold record `` ca n't take my eyes off you '' and walk calmly to the sofa once i 'm there i melt into the sand-rubbed upholstery with the arts technology girls who haven't yet passed out on the floor while i 'm lying with my back to the armrest i glimpse a piece of sky i 've seen only in films of the old grain it 's a wild purple darkness with a bright white hole in it i 'm thinking to myself god my personal jesus christ and saviour i want you to come down here through that hole in the night and join me in eden
loot my point of view hove my heart free from its hived booth though i know your smoke its black blossom is a substance i ’ ll never become colors of plaster and grass i ’ ve prepped flawlessly rivers i ’ ve whittled thin it ’ s a personal matter to me the wind but let it be our cathedral feeling a sculpture of ash dragging its robe over the hills because of us because of me yellow is hurried but red moves like a swarm through toothpick homes pans over roofs where the ethos we child from the ground will blacken to ruin let ’ s glory this roughened nap of landscape this parched arcadia with one nude-struck match and a breeze

some folks fool themselves into believing but i know what i know once at the height of hopeless touching my man and i hold our breaths certain we can stop time or maybe eliminate it from our lives which are shorter since we learned to make love for each other rather than doing it to each other as for praise and worship i prefer the latter only memory makes us kneel silent and still hear me thunder scares lightning lets us see then heads covered we wait for rain dear lord let me watch for his arrival and hang my head and shake it like a man who 's lost and lived something keeps trying but i 'm not killed yet

whereas the porch screen sags from the weight of flowers impatiens that grew against it then piles of wet leaves then drifted snow and whereas now rolled like absence in its drooping length a dim gold wave sundown ’ s last cast across a sea of clouds and the floating year almost reaches the legs of the low-slung chair and whereas between bent trees flies and bees twirl above apples and peaches fallen on blue gravel and whereas yesterday ’ s thunder shook blossoms off laurel the day after they appeared and whereas in the dust the fine and perfect dust of cat-paw prints scattered across the gleaming car hood something softer than blossoms falls away something your lips left on mine and whereas it ’ s anyone ’ s guess as to how long it ’ s been since a humid day sank so low so far from the present that missing sensations or the sensation of something missing have left impressions in the air the kind a head leaves on a pillow and whereas the last of ancient unconvincing notions evaporate from the damp pages of thick old books that describe how for instance time and love once lay together here how in a slurred flash of light she turned and waded back into the sea and how the slack part of any day was and is all in the way he half asleep felt her hand slip out of his and whereas the blue heron stands on the shore while the sleek heron turns broad to narrow half hidden among the reeds turning with the stealth the sweep of twilight ’ s narrowing minute of stillness taking aim turning until it almost disappears into the arrowhead instant the day disappears until staring out of the reeds the aforementioned heron is more felt than seen and whereas you with due forethought and deliberation bite into an apple ’ s heart and wish it were your own

a garden late spring honeysuckle and lazy birds heavy with the round scent of tuberoses and jungle gardenia there is a man in boots that make his thighs look lethal with a whip no spurs medieval sorrow in his eyes or around the mouth maybe he is dangerous in this place he has the fertility of steel there is a woman in a vine green habit her veins are purple her blue eyes she is blonde though sometimes brunette “ my horse is lamed i was riding i ... ” and — still in the heavy air they push each other down like dogs with fleas under the bushes in them the camera pans to the nearest tree the cat approaches like a panther she is also in boots like an empress who loves horses the man puts on spurs there is combat his knightly despair her deathly power the witch burns finally — the lamed horse returns love you lanita
two of them with chests like blond silk cornsilk hair stalled in traffic in the awful heat they smiled were they messengers delivering through the open window promises or lies or invitations boys are everywhere at noon they glide between parched cars bare broad shoulders color of chestnut colts in the poison dusk they catch falling stars in their silly mouths for girls for each other their teeth gleam reflections off blue rayon this town as large as it is has one shimmering boy in all the cars and in every phone booth
i poured a whiskey and soda watching the tree outside dissolve light going backward pushed to corners to the white sliver of wood around the door where was that river seething with light i recall the banks menaced by wasps swollen on summer sap a cement hollow stuck with their strange cradles a woozy stench of damp clay the blunt poison of water snakes i do remember someone close warm flesh pushed to the sand the ocean a dark noise echoing gulls and a wail of forlorn love moonlight like yellowed keys on his antique piano music across the water our song tides pulled awful and endless as the spine of memory the light is lost my glass is hollow the door is luminous like a firefly at midnight
the man who told me about war said it 's the only thing that keeps us busy i thought of your fingers on my back counting the vertebrae one by one the only thing
she sat on his lap for hours pressed his face to her large pink breasts her hands moved through his hair like fond snakes she gave him curls cleft hooves beneath the flesh marvellous flesh and smooth shoulders she taught him how to use his tongue to shape a heart from a piece of ice
there ’ s blue and then there ’ s blue a number not a hue this blue is not the undertone of any one but there it is primary i held the bouquet in shock and cut the stems at a deadly angle i opened the toxic sachet of flower food with my canine and rinsed my mouth i used to wash my hands and daydream i dreamed of myself and washed my hands of everything easy math now i can ’ t get their procedure at the florist off my mind the white flowers arrived they overnighted in a chemical bath and now they have a fake laugh that catches like a match that starts the kind of kitchen fire that is fanned by water they won ’ t even look at me happy anniversary
distrust this season breeds in me whole blue worlds am second to leafy nouns pinned back darkening lip of the night untrustworthy sidewalk glazed and sleeping there peachy trees a line drawn from one brow of a star down and planted each pillow little shimmer little wilt startled from out the arranging field moonlit pale behind no foxes in me finding the fragrant new crisis not dead still where i love you in feast and pledge worlds rolling first on crookedly and on
i want the hole in my ear to be quiet and inside the hole in my ear to be quiet and i want it to tell me what to do or i will go to my lover ’ s mouth and say oh my quiet i am coming and tell the quiet how its kingdom should be made though the quiet has already eaten me because the quiet loves me but does the lover love me and why must the quiet be so quiet and why can ’ t the quiet have a cock and where is its violet mouth its ten fingers with which to fix me and where is its belly breathing and o i want to be fixed but i am already fixed why don ’ t i feel it
i tell me it was for the hunger nothing less for hunger is to give the body what it knows it can not keep that this amber light whittled down by another war is all that pins my hand to your chest i you drowning between my arms — stay you pushing your body into the river only to be left with yourself — stay i i ’ ll tell you how we ’ re wrong enough to be forgiven how one night after backhanding mother then taking a chainsaw to the kitchen table my father went to kneel in the bathroom until we heard his muffled cries through the walls and so i learned that a man in climax was the closest thing to surrender i say surrender say alabaster switchblade honeysuckle goldenrod say autumn say autumn despite the green in your eyes beauty despite daylight say you ’ d kill for it unbreakable dawn mounting in your throat my thrashing beneath you like a sparrow stunned with falling i dusk a blade of honey between our shadows draining i i wanted to disappear — so i opened the door to a stranger ’ s car he was divorced he was still alive he was sobbing into his hands hands that tasted like rust the pink breast cancer ribbon on his keychain swayed in the ignition don ’ t we touch each other just to prove we are still here i was still here once the moon distant flickering trapped itself in beads of sweat on my neck i let the fog spill through the cracked window cover my fangs when i left the buick kept sitting there a dumb bull in pasture its eyes searing my shadow onto the side of suburban houses at home i threw myself on the bed like a torch watched the flames gnaw through my mother ’ s house until the sky appeared bloodshot massive how i wanted to be that sky — to hold every flying falling at once i say amen say amend say yes say yes anyway i in the shower sweating under cold water i scrubbed scrubbed i in the life before this one you could tell two people were in love because when they drove the pickup over the bridge their wings would grow back just in time some days i am still inside the pickup some days i keep waiting i it ’ s not too late our heads haloed with gnats summer too early to leave any marks your hand under my shirt as static intensifies on the radio your other hand pointing your daddy ’ s revolver to the sky stars falling one by one in the cross hairs this means i won ’ t be afraid if we ’ re already here already more than skin can hold that a body beside a body must make a field full of ticking that your name is only the sound of clocks being set back another hour morning finds our clothes on your mother ’ s front porch shed like week-old lilies
as p strolled the path around the pond he sniffed the humid air his kimono brushed the parched ground the metals of the earth rose up in traces of dust and hints of lightning a waft of petrichor the smell before the rain beyond the pale hills of his peaceful land scores of horse soldiers prepared their armor soon the soldiers would sweep across the plains and the dry politics of princely maneuverings would be as rice paper soaked with blood instead of petty policies — immensity peaceful farmers would be impaled paltry officials imprisoned — twisted screaming then praying there on the dusty path the young poet p was just perceiving the beforeness of it all the pre- from his masters he had learned that immensity makes the small crucial a little poem before a big war becomes a necessity and like a small poem on a long scroll a lily pad appeared on the pond p stopped to peer he puzzled through its pattern of green inside green on water a poem began to perfuse it was inside p but it was also on the lily pad at ... on ... at first only prepositions came to him he stared into the water seeing the silvery clouds reflected then he leaned at an extreme angle and noticed the pattern of his gown wavering in the reeds a pinpoint of a poem stabbed him like the sharp scent of earth before the rain petrichor before before • then drops pelted the pond pipped at the pond plunged toward it plummeted into it driving p to take refuge beneath the deep tiled eaves of his house inside the sliding paper doors were a desk and a futon on the desk lay a brush on the futon lay a lover in uneasy sleep on petal-printed silk he chose the desk he lifted the brush while looking down at the restive slumberer in a mere matter of stopped time he had his poem written from the very tissues of an arm and hand that could plunge a sword silver soldiers mass on far horizons but here silk pools on the bed the rain rained moisture curled the edges of the paper seventeen syllables an epic of energy made him drowsy and hungry his lover still asleep he rose ate leftover peaches poached in soy sauce and ginger and with the rain a drizzle thought again of his poem how could he have loved it in the instant after he wrote it but now be so unsure he sat at his desk again another one this time he drafted poppy penis up prow into periwinkle peony behind after he calligraphed the puzzle of passion across the page he woke the one in the pond of pink silk and they proved it on the futon he heard the pluvial patter on the eaves while they angled and slipped perspiring on silk the stamping and snorting of the horses sweating in their armor was far too far away to be sensed by p but he heard he felt the pond muddied and the roof cracked and the poems scattered how far was he now from this picture in his mind he worked to make his pleasure stay pitiable and small against the portents rising for p was afraid this afternoon would never be remembered after the bloody conquering but later the barbarians would bivouac in this house the pond saved for drinking water the path roughened by horses and the reverse of p ’ s scroll used for another man ’ s military diary his afternoon ’ s foreboding and pleasure a preparation for the future and in the future a stay against another ’ s view of the past “ p from alphabetique ” 2013 by kara kosaka
'in our time the destiny of man presents its meanings in political terms thomas mann how can i that girl standing there my attention fix on roman or on russian or on spanish politics yet here 's a travelled man that knows what he talks about and there 's a politician that has both read and thought and maybe what they say is true of war and war 's alarms but o that i were young again and held her in my arms
learning to love differently is hard love with the hands wide open love with the doors banging on their hinges the cupboard unlocked the wind roaring and whimpering in the rooms rustling the sheets and snapping the blinds that thwack like rubber bands in an open palm it hurts to love wide open stretching the muscles that feel as if they are made of wet plaster then of blunt knives then of sharp knives it hurts to thwart the reflexes of grab of clutch to love and let go again and again it pesters to remember the lover who is not in the bed to hold back what is owed to the work that gutters like a candle in a cave without air to love consciously conscientiously concretely constructively i can ’ t do it you say it ’ s killing me but you thrive you glow on the street like a neon raspberry you float and sail a helium balloon bright bachelor ’ s button blue and bobbing on the cold and hot winds of our breath as we make and unmake in passionate diastole and systole the rhythm of our unbound bonding to have and not to hold to love with minimized malice hunger and anger moment by moment balanced
this is what it 's like you sit in the white room singular knees together arms over your head to break the noise from the radio that is false as a drunk 's promise to loan you his car next week of course next week never comes lies continue nobody disbelieves them but some are ready for the real story the young man involved breaks her tired heart it 's the usual spilt liquor broken dishes wrecked cars
everything that was young went quickly the way his eyes met mine as soon as we woke together in a room outside nanjing feeling as if all the things that were falling would fall and make their thunder leave us with the challenge of being happy all the things that felt given when gifts were not just surprises but what we knew what we hoped to take with us to heaven unbound by faults and sins not deceived the way we were when the end came to what we knew of china landing me here i am a wish in the skies spun out from celestial space to be poor to be covered with black skin a felt quilt of a map with only one way to china — through pain as big as hogs squealing at killing time on black farms in alabama — the noise of death the shrill needle that turns clouds over to rip the air above the cities where people are young and all that is given is never taken away
never let my hands be to any one an occasion to temptation — isabel de flores she was the joke of the angels—a girl crazy enough for god that she despised her own beauty who grew bitter herbs to mix with her food who pinned a garland of roses to her forehead and who in a fury of desire concocted a potion of indian pepper and bark and rubbed it on her face neck and breasts disfiguring herself then locked away in a dark cell where no reflection was possible she begged for death to join her with her master whom she called divine bridegroom thorn in my heart eternal spouse she would see his vague outline feel his cool touch on her fevered brow but as relief came her vision would begin to fade and once again she would dip the iron bar into the coals and pass it gently like a magician ’ s wand over her skin— to feel the passion that flames for a moment in all dying things
they are thin and rarely marry living out their long lives in spacious rooms french doors giving view to formal gardens where aromatic flowers grow in profusion they play their pianos in the late afternoon tilting their heads at a gracious angle as if listening to notes pitched above the human range age makes them translucent each palpitation of their hearts visible at temple or neck when they die it ’ s in their sleep their spirits shaking gently loose from a hostess too well bred to protest
though it ’ s all too clear how unimpressed you are by a cri de cœur and wafting away unhugged is from your perspective de rigueur of schemes to rendezvous with you i ’ m still a restless entrepreneur the thought of you converts my favorite main dishes into hors d ’ oeuvres my addiction to the tingling you induce is a fait accompli each drifting day is another page in the secret book whose dénouement never arrives while your fleeting glances lock me into this unfinishable roman à clef the idea that any one remembered moment at a party or picnic was my sole forever lost chance to touch you must be a cul de sac when my projects for a prudent career try to stand up your voice remembered administers the coup de grâce and my mélange of bright ideas becomes a mere potpourri how i would love to believe this dance is a folie à deux the way you stride across memorial drive is a tour de force but glimpses across traffic make a paper-thin raison d ’ être your recent exit is implicit in many a mise en scène it ’ s as if you heard me approaching for a tête à tête and you slipped into the elevator with your tall boots and sangfroid always you get to reculer and i never seem to mieux sauter— still i will keep an eye out for you on every rez-de-chaussée
even two years later she still gets correspondence addressed to him correspondence this like that mostly about his hobby coin collector brochures announcements of collector swap meets his pastime a way to spend an afternoon back when an afternoon needed spending before all the silence flooded the house he had old currency nickels worth ten dollars and heavy the bags musical too she needs to sort through them all that 's what she should do realize its value but what she is thinking of is spending it buying gum and soft drinks maybe a chocolate bar just get face value for mint-condition rarities get them back into circulation circulation the afterlife where someone else could get them as change and be joyful at the luck of finding his life 's pleasure
what if hope crashes through the door what if that lasts a somersault hope for serendipity even if a series of meals were all between us even if the aeons lined up out of order what are years if not measured by trees
it 's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers there is only this sound of falling quiet and remote like the memory of scales descending the white keys of a childhood piano—outside the window palms and the heavy head of the cereus inclining soon to let down its white or yellow-white now only these poor snow-flowers in a heap like the memory of a white dress cast down so much has fallen and i who have listened for a step all afternoon hear it now but already falling away already in memory and the terrible scales descending on the silent piano the snow and the absent flowers abounding

by the river years ago recursive in memory a finite moment the past ended future began the river flowed south you were a man ’ s face floating among stones by a river in autumn willow leaves were yellow whisks in updrafts we were not alone cottonwood boles twisted against banks turtles dozed in the roots bark slivered into water the river sounded the swish of its name you waded the neosho as it meandered east two sandhill cranes fly overhead their legs stretch straight behind as they swim through air their grace is the river ’ s no one saw flood-seined silt gravel broken mussel pearls i stayed you left by the river i met you each day i meet you each day i will be meeting you in invariant futures by the river leaves turn mud cracks pentagonal shapes you return and leave the river remains by the river i was a child i am grown i remember water pooled not moving

drawing a breath between each sentence trailing closely every word — james hoch ‘ draft ’ in miscreants 1. some things i knew were beyond choosing didu — grandmother — wilting under cancer ’ s terminal care mama — my uncle ’ s — mysterious disappearance — ventilator vibrating severed silently in the hospital ’ s unkempt dark an old friend ’ s biting silence — unexplained — promised loyalties melting for profit abandoning long familial presences of trust devi ’ s jealous heart misreading emails hacked carefully under cover her fingernails ripping unformed poems bloodied scarred — my diary pages weeping wordlessly — my children aborted my poetry breathless forever 2. these are acts that enact themselves regardless — helpless as i am torn asunder permanently drugged numbed strange love this is — a salving what medics and nurses do i live buddha-like unblinking a painted vacant smile — one that stores pain and painlessness — someone else ’ s nirvana thrust upon me some things i once believed in are beyond my choosing — choosing is a choice unavailable to me
under the soft translucent linen the ridges around your nipples harden at the thought of my tongue you — lying inverted like the letter ‘ c ’ — arch yourself deliberately wanting the warm press of my lips it ’ s wet to coat the skin that is bristling burning breaking into sweats of desire — sweet juices of imagination but in fact i haven ’ t even touched you at least not yet
were you but lying cold and dead and lights were paling out of the west you would come hither and bend your head and i would lay my head on your breast and you would murmur tender words forgiving me because you were dead nor would you rise and hasten away though you have the will of wild birds but know your hair was bound and wound about the stars and moon and sun o would beloved that you lay under the dock-leaves in the ground while lights were paling one by one
never give all the heart for love will hardly seem worth thinking of to passionate women if it seem certain and they never dream that it fades out from kiss to kiss for everything that ’ s lovely is but a brief dreamy kind delight o never give the heart outright for they for all smooth lips can say have given their hearts up to the play and who could play it well enough if deaf and dumb and blind with love he that made this knows all the cost for he gave all his heart and lost
why should i blame her that she filled my days with misery or that she would of late have taught to ignorant men most violent ways or hurled the little streets upon the great had they but courage equal to desire what could have made her peaceful with a mind that nobleness made simple as a fire with beauty like a tightened bow a kind that is not natural in an age like this being high and solitary and most stern why what could she have done being what she is was there another troy for her to burn
some may have blamed you that you took away the verses that could move them on the day when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind with lightning you went from me and i could find nothing to make a song about but kings helmets and swords and half-forgotten things that were like memories of you—but now we 'll out for the world lives as long ago and while we 're in our laughing weeping fit hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit but dear cling close to me since you were gone my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone
ix there i was all spread out for the taking bloomed wings waiting for winter sleet it was a long season of drinking whole creeks and nothing else we churned desert into desert what i ’ m saying is neither the desert rat nor damselfly can bear the nosebleeds shoal- laced face bearing down just in time to overwinter there i was all spread out for the taking in truth nobody wants water this thin one swallow and we ’ re off to dig for more within a hollow womb this morning we sip water discussing the trauma in our blood saltwater — there it rests in droplets on my breast skin “ oh ” i say “ my tears ” rubbing them deep within xi at church i sat salvaged i said to send me away wearing nothing but satin and lace we both felt secondhand it was knee- length and it wore me cheap i couldn ’ t embrace the old woman who once wore it couldn ’ t see my wrists even and my neck it was braced up all in lace the woman next to me says “ how beautiful. ” i say “ this beautiful ” then split a hair down the middle i lied “ i made it myself ” then stood up to fade through painstaking humiliation as a child a girl i saw through myself to age 45. it was then when i first noticed the aching of my hands how they were soon to set themselves away — they came and went as if they were lace for the breaking xiii i was reciting alfred lord tennyson on my back in a canoe floating the holiest way i knew — so close to ghost and went pale for a moment before finding myself wandering among high pines i didn ’ t expect to emerge in white already with my heart in his hand just as normal as a shell rests on my chest didn ’ t expect to hand it over so early on at the boundary of our properties in a dream in the grasses where he ended and i began i ’ m feeling very still now that we ’ ve crossed over into the pale where we are soon to thread soon to embellish then loop back into each other braided the way we were taught to approach each other — the same way
1 late fall the white fur grew up your spine thick as the tail of a marten you built up the fire wrapped your legs with skins but how that chill wind broke through sill and jamb we stuffed paper in every crevice — an uncle ’ s will the writ that changed your name a certificate of degree of indian blood and one that said o positive still we shivered your eyes yellow in the lantern ’ s light always they were out there in a field of boulders the size of bears hunched over o you were silky with fur with a sharp smell i could not get enough of i fell into a dream of milk and skin on the bed of pelts in the winter cabin when i woke they had taken you or you had gone with them and didn ’ t i so green with sleep track you the three days until new snow fell 2 i packed flint and tinder and a compass whose face shines in the lowest light i learned a song to map the way and one to call you back i crouched over every footprint sniffing and here was a broken branch and here something like hair caught by a bramble i followed and followed — all the yellow hours until i came to untouched earth and waited in the clearing for the snow to come down white as the winter blanket you long had wanted 3 in the spring when you come down hungry from that other mountain the space between one rib and the next deep enough to lay my finger — how much of you will remain or linger — bone or mouth or memory of the first sadness of humans will you dig from the crevices the paper where they wrote you down as this instead of that or startle at the clatter of plates the creak of the wooden bed will your skin shake off its fur your claws remember they were fingers and the hands meaty as paws soften into what i once could stroke or suckle

i felt suddenly convinced that i had feelings for the wallpaper i was especially captivated by its blonde hair and bad dreams i had the impression the wallpaper needed longer to properly respond by the time i left my affections had produced this abrasion on my cheek people looked on the abrasion as unquestionable proof of my sincerity the abrasion was produced by rubbing my face on the paper ’ s smooth surface it only occurred to me later that it might have found this sensation disagreeable but by then i had become known for my abrasion and i seldom thought of discussed or in any way depended upon the wallpaper for anything my affections though had produced upon the paper their own mark to my irritation and gradual dismay interest in the paper ’ s abrasion began to outweigh interest in my own indeed mine was starting to fade while the mark upon the paper had deepened with the passing of time people liked to visit the paper in its room and probe their fingers into the widening tear by now a gruesome black-edged wound the silence of the paper during these incursions suggested to some condemnation of their curiosity but to others implied approval some even speculated that the paper “ enjoyed ” the infringement of its surfaces while most agreed it was a question of the paper enduring this indignity having little or no opportunity to protest some visitors could not contain their enthusiasm and over time other recesses were opened in the paper without its consent the earliest admirers of the paper ’ s abrasion were heard lamenting the gulf between the paper ’ s current state and its previous appearance they opined that to experience the abrasion now was to encounter a kind of mockery of the gentle and informal gesture it had once been others contended that while the paper ’ s condition was certainly different it couldn ’ t be in any way “ better ” or “ worse ” than it had been originally on the contrary the paper exhibiting as it did the marks of the affections spent upon it was in every way a true record of the destruction this attention had wrought and had become if anything a more moving testament charting as it did the changing and accelerated passions of the times in later phases of the paper ’ s deterioration some expressed admiration for the stoical indifference with which the paper withstood its abusers and wondered if such an attitude might not improve the willing and reciprocal style with which they and their contemporaries were accustomed to receiving each other ’ s gazes and caresses against the odds this view seemed timely and took root in the populace and to this day in all the estimations of historians and critics of culture it is widely held accountable for the period of dormancy and inertia among the youngest of our people whose silence and repose has replaced the humors and rages of those whose desires had flown unchecked who had coupled for so long with such energy and frequency
a translator who has a phobia of moths spent three years translating a book with a moth motif it ’ s ironic she has said that she knew more about the moths than the author of the original who was merely fascinated the translation contained a greater variety of moths than the original drawn from suggestions she had made some of which were in fact too perfect and changed back before it went to print her moths the ones that were too aptly named meant too much her moths that she hated where are they now the same place as all the versions of people that have been undressed and slept with in lieu of the people themselves by others that must include a version of almost everyone lots of versions of some people some only a flutter animated then decided against

it was a singles cruise but it wasn ’ t a singles cruise each participant simulated detachment but none was actually single some like the recently widowed were attached to ghosts others were legally attached to a living person they once but no longer loved a surprising number loved their partners profoundly while fearing said partners inhabited the category of those who loved them no longer these participants whose fears may or may not have been founded attempted to self-protect by labeling themselves single soon a pattern emerged those who feared abandonment developed around them a planetary-like orbit of potential new partners to whom they could not attach because they were already attached such orbits lasted sometimes for years the orbiters went to self-help groups and/or analysts and/or wrote letters to advice columnists because they could not detach from their objects of unrequited affection they became the predominant clientele for future singles cruises unilaterally sustaining the singles cruise business
i think i always liked the game because it sounded like my name combined with the concept of alone my name really does mean “ alone ” in slovenian we don ’ t actually care if it ’ s true but we want to know the person telling us is telling us the truth say his name is “ hank ” as in “ of hair. ” it ’ s not my upbringing was classically smooth/chaotic apart from traumatic events i ’ ve never detailed even to myself traumatic but methodical but why say what happened even in the tech block the blinds were down and i cleared my way to the final marble under the indistinct gaze of an indistinct master my success had allowed me to become the bastard i always knew i could be what did it mean to clean the board like this counting down to one by these gradual and orderly subtractions my persona was configured the goal was to remain single sometimes telling you the truth wouldn ’ t be telling you anything much for a while i ’ ve felt torpid and detuned as if i want to share a view with you so we can both be absent in one place look the sky is beautiful and sour i ’ m not here too i ’ m staring out of this cloud like an anagram whose solution is probably itself i am only the method that this stupid game was invented to explain
his superpower was that his testicles manufactured sperm with exclusively x chromosomes that was ironic because not only was he a beast to women but his 40 baby girls grew up seeking men like the father they barely saw unless they went to his studio to be painted which wasn ’ t ok with their mothers who were not only jealous but guilty of giving birth to girls who were products of an x-chromosome-making monster would soon suffer at the hands of other monsters with x- type sperm thereby assuring the continuation of suffering meanwhile all the girls became writers who slouched from sitting at desks being daughters lovers of beasts

i the story of him who knew the most of all men know who made the journey heartbroken reconciled who knew the way things were before the flood the secret things the mystery who went to the end of the earth and over who returned and wrote the story on a tablet of stone he built uruk he built the keeping place of anu and ishtar the outer wall shines in the sun like brightest copper the inner wall is beyond the imagining of kings study the brickwork study the fortification climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace study how it is made from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields the ponds and orchards this is uruk the city of gilgamesh the wild ox son of lugalbanda son of the lady wildcow ninsun gilgamesh the vanguard and the rear guard of the army shadow of darkness over the enemy field the web the flood that rises to wash away the walls of alien cities gilgamesh the strongest one of all the perfect the terror it is he who opened passes through the mountains and he who dug deep wells on the mountainsides who measured the world and sought out utnapishtim beyond the world it is he who restored the shrines two-thirds a god one-third a man the king go to the temple of anu and ishtar open the copper chest with the iron locks the tablet of lapis lazuli tells the story ii there was no withstanding the aura or power of the wild ox gilgamesh neither the father 's son nor the wife of the noble neither the mother 's daughter nor the warrior 's bride was safe the old men said '' is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people '' the gods of heaven listened to their complaint `` aruru is the maker of this king neither the father 's son nor the wife of the noble is safe in uruk neither the mother 's daughter nor the warrior 's bride is safe the old men say 'is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people there is no withstanding the desire of the wild ox `` they called the goddess aruru saying to her '' you made this man now create another create his double and let the two contend let stormy heart contend with stormy heart that peace may come to uruk once again '' aruru listened and heard and then created out of earth clay and divine spittle the double the stormy-hearted other enkidu the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands powerful as ninurta the god of war the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles visits the watering places with the creatures whose hearts delight as his delights in water iii one day a hunter came to a watering place and saw enkidu he stood expressionless astonished then with his silent dogs he went home to his father 's house fear in his belly his face was as one estranged from what he knows he opened his mouth and said to his father `` father i saw a hairy-bodied man today at the watering place powerful as ninurta the god of war he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles he visits the watering places with the beasts he has unset my traps and filled my hunting pits the creatures of the grasslands get away free the wild man sets them free because of him i am no longer a hunter '' his father said `` go to uruk and there present yourself to gilgamesh the king who is the strongest of all the perfect the terror the wise shepherd protector of the people tell him about the power of the wild man ask him to send a harlot back with you a temple prostitute to conquer him with her greater power when he visits the watering place let her show him her breasts her beauty for his wonder he will lie with her in pleasure and then the creatures the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' so the hunter went to gilgamesh in uruk and told him about the power of the wild man and how he had unset the traps and filled the pits so that the creatures got away free the lord of uruk said to the hunter then '' when you return a temple prostitute will go with you and with her beauty conquer the wild man he will lie with her and then the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' iv the harlot and the hunter traveled together taking three days back to the watering place for three more days they waited and finally enkidu came with the creatures that love the water the gazelles and the others so as to drink their fill the temple prostitute looked at him enkidu the hairy-bodied wild man of the grasslands the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle `` that is enkidu shamhat show him your breasts show him your beauty spread out your cloak on the ground lie down on it the wild man will look at you show him your body the hairy-bodied man will come to you and lie down on you and then show him the things a woman knows how to do the gazelles and with them all the other creatures will flee from him who ranged the hills with them '' and so the harlot shamhat showed him her breasts showed him her body the hairy-bodied man came over to her and lay down on her and then she showed him the things a woman knows how to do for seven days enkidu in his wonder lay with her in pleasure and then at last went to seek out the company of the creatures whose hearts delight in feeding upon the grasslands and visiting the watering places and ranging the hills but seeing him they fled the creatures were gone and everything was changed his body that loved to range the hills was now unable to follow but in the mind of the wild man there was beginning a new understanding bewildered he turned and sought out the company of the temple prostitute he sat down beside her and looked into her face and listened to her '' enkidu now you are beautiful as a god why do you seek the company of beasts come with me to the city to uruk to the temple of anu and the goddess ishtar gilgamesh is the ruler the strongest of all the terror the aura and power of his desire can be withstood by no one '' then enkidu whose heart was beginning to know about itself and longed for a companion cried aloud '' take me to uruk the city of gilgamesh whose aura and power can not be withstood i will cry out in uruk challenging him 'it is i enkidu the strength of the wild man born in the wilderness can not be withstood `` the temple prostitute replied `` come then to uruk where the processions are and music and let us go together through the dancing to the palace hall where gilgamesh presides the favorite of the gods the beautiful strongest of all the terror the most desired look at his radiant face the favorite of shamash and enlil ea and anu while you were grazing beastlike with gazelles before your mind had any understanding his mind a gift to the gifted of the gods had a dream of you before you knew of him in the early morning gilgamesh arose and told his mother his dream 'i had a dream a star fell from the heavens a meteorite and lay on the empty plain outside uruk the men and women came and wondered at it i strove with it to lift it but could not i was drawn to it as if it was a woman all-knowing rimat-ninsun spoke to him the lord of uruk gilgamesh his mother all-knowing rimat-ninsun spoke and said '' the star that fell from the heavens the meteorite that lay on the empty plain outside uruk the star you could not lift when you strove with it the star you were drawn to as if drawn to a woman is the strong companion powerful as a star the meteorite of the heavens a gift of the gods that you were drawn to it as if drawn to a woman means that this companion will not forsake you he will protect and guard you with his life this is the fortunate meaning of your dream then gilgamesh the lord of uruk said 'may the dream as you interpret come to pass `` the temple prostitute thus told the tale
it was n't holy so let us not praise gods let us not look to them for bread nor the cup that changed water to wine let us look to the bend of the road that reaches a silver blur across the skyline woman standing on the farm in her grasp the shine that is seed that is beginning she will work the earth bounty in the vault of cosmos above her heat lightning that lassoes in its manic current man never existed but to invite danger loveless one there was once an army of men saluting from bayonet to bomb they were expert at sabotage hand combat you stop the clock in your paltry chest the one that says choose choose wind that desired backward ring the alarm when you wake no more pain a mirror like a window looking out what can your past now say to you that has never been said before what of that clock that forbade you to move forward what of the clock that asked for nothing but passage the minutes careening into you like a fitful arrow what of the clock that summoned nothing not even mercy once you tired of wanting a face to break you started the clock again
i am haunted by how much our mothers do not know how a republic falls because of its backhanded deals stairwell secrets my mother does not know i am lying with a man who is darker than me that we do not have names for how we truly treat our bodies what we do with them the other possesses me without him the perception of me fails to exist my mother now is taking her sheers and cutting through live shrimp when i was a child she peeled each flushed grape until only the pale fleshy bead remained she placed them onto a plate in one shining mound deseeded in front of me how i sucked and bled the fruit of all their juice hypnotized in front of the buzz of television in each version of my childhood i am her daughter this is certain i am lying down with a man who is darker than me and maybe this poem is my real republic my face is my face or is it stolen from my mother and hung over mine if i were a dream you could say my countenance was a string of flickering lights made of teeth or an expression unraveling like a carpet into a narrow river of another life does truth matter when it 's floating face up or face down the answer to this makes all the difference
my hair voluminous from sleeping in six different positions redolent with your scent helps me recall that last night was indeed real that it 's possible for a bedspread to spawn a watershed in the membrane that keeps us shut in our own skins mute without pleasure that i did n't just dream you into being you fit like a fig in the thick of my tongue give my hands their one true purpose find in my shoulder a groove for your head in a clinch you 're clenched and i 'm pinched we 're spooned forked wrenched lynched in a chestnut by a mob of our own making only to be resurrected to stage several revivals that arise from slightest touch to thwart deep sleep with necessities i never knew i knew until meeting you a few days or many distant voluptuous lifetimes ago
i thought i was so tough but gentled at your hands can not be quick enough to fly for you and show that when i go i go at your commands even in flight above i am no longer free you seeled me with your love i am blind to other birds— the habit of your words has hooded me as formerly i wheel i hover and i twist but only want the feel in my possessive thought of catcher and of caught upon your wrist you but half civilize taming me in this way through having only eyes for you i fear to lose i lose to keep and choose tamer as prey
was helen stronger than achilles even `` as the arrows fell '' that could not be but he recognised in her some power other than her legendary beauty he could name helena but the other he could not name she was a lure a light an intimate flame a secret kept even from his slaves the elect the innermost hierarchy only helena could be named and she was a public scandal in any case a cause of shame to agamemnon and menelaus it was not that she was beautiful true she stood on the walls taut and indifferent as the arrows fell it was not that she was beautiful there were others in spite of the legend as gracious as tall it was not that she was beautiful but he stared and stared across the charred wood and the smouldering flame till his eyes cleared and the smoke drifted away
i we are n't serious when we 're seventeen —one fine evening to hell with beer and lemonade noisy cafés with their shining lamps we walk under the green linden trees of the park the lindens smell good in the good june evenings at times the air is so scented that we close our eyes the wind laden with sounds—the town is n't far— has the smell of grapevines and beer ii —there you can see a very small patch of dark blue framed by a little branch pinned up by a naughty star that melts in gentle quivers small and very white night in june seventeen years old —we are overcome by it all the sap is champagne and goes to our head we talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips trembling there like a small insect iii our wild heart moves through novels like robinson crusoe —when in the light of a pale street lamp a girl goes by attractive and charming under the shadow of her father 's terrible collar and as she finds you incredibly naïve while clicking her little boots she turns abruptly and in a lively way —then cavatinas die on your lips iv you are in love occupied until the month of august you are in love —your sonnets make her laugh all your friends go off you are ridiculous —then one evening the girl you worship deigned to write to you —that evening —you return to the bright cafés you ask for beer or lemonade —we 're not serious when we are seventeen and when we have green linden trees in the park

a great light is the man who knows the woman he loves a great light is the woman who knows the man she loves and carries the light into room after room arousing the sleepers and looking hard into the face of each and then sends them asleep again with a kiss or a whole night of love and goes on and on until the man and woman who carry the great lights of the knowledge of the one lover enter the room toward which their light is sent and fit the one and the other torch in a high candelabrum and there is such light that children leap up unless the sea swallow them in the crossing or hatred or war against which do not pray only but be vigilant and set your hand to the work

there ’ s nothing in my face there is nothing in yours what we have are called heads they are nothing unless we kiss lips are wonderful they are full of mechanoreceptors in the old world we all used to kiss and kiss it was then that we did have faces we had noses and cheeks and foreheads and soft downy hair in the new world we stopped kissing those who were already here stopped those who came stopped now there are only four people who have heads that are also faces they are an artist and three children for whom i have a face other than my hands
my shadow followed me to san diego silently she never complained no green card no identity pass she is wedded to my fate the moon is a drunk and anorectic constantly reeling changing weight my shadow dances grotesquely resentful she ca n't leave me the moon mourns his unwritten novels cries naked into the trees and fades tomorrow he 'll return to beat me blue—again again and again goodbye moon goodbye shadow my husband my lover i 'm late the sun will plunge through the window i must make my leap of faith
when eduard raban coming along the passage walked into the open doorway he saw that it was raining it was not raining much kafka wedding preparations in the country the concept is interesting to see as though reflected in streaming windowpanes the look of others through their own eyes a digest of their correct impressions of their self-analytical attitudes overlaid by your ghostly transparent face you in falbalas of some distant but not too distant era the cosmetics the shoes perfectly pointed drifting how long you have been drifting how long i have too for that matter like a bottle-imp toward a surface which can never be approached never pierced through into the timeless energy of a present which would have its own opinions on these matters are an epistemological snapshot of the processes that first mentioned your name at some crowded cocktail party long ago and someone not the person addressed overheard it and carried that name around in his wallet for years as the wallet crumbled and bills slid in and out of it i want that information very much today ca n't have it and this makes me angry i shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of avignon on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge i shall at last see my complete face reflected not in the water but in the worn stone floor of my bridge i shall keep to myself i shall not repeat others comments about me
now that you too must shortly go the way which in these bloodshot years uncounted men have gone in vanishing armies day by day and in their numbers will not come again i must not strain the moments of our meeting striving for each look each accent not to miss or question of our parting and our greeting is this the last of all is this—or this last sight of all it may be with these eyes last touch last hearing since eyes hands and ears even serving love are our mortalities and cling to what they own in mortal fears — but oh let end what will i hold you fast by immortal love which has no first or last
“ died of wounds ” because you died i shall not rest again but wander ever through the lone world wide seeking the shadow of a dream grown vain because you died i shall spend brief and idle hours beside the many lesser loves that still remain but find in none my triumph and my pride and disillusion 's slow corroding stain will creep upon each quest but newly tried for every striving now shall nothing gain because you died
i feel the spring far off far off the faint far scent of bud and leaf— oh how can spring take heart to come to a world in grief deep grief the sun turns north the days grow long later the evening star grows bright— how can the daylight linger on for men to fight still fight the grass is waking in the ground soon it will rise and blow in waves— how can it have the heart to sway over the graves new graves under the boughs where lovers walked the apple-blooms will shed their breath— but what of all the lovers now parted by death grey death
suddenly with a shy sad grace she turns to me her lighted face and i who hear some idle phrase watch how her wry lips move and guess that the poor words they frame mean naught for they would speak the same message i read in the dark flame within her eyes which say “ i love. ” but i can only turn away i that have heard the deep voice break into a sing-song sobbing shake whose flutter made my being quake what ears have i for women 's cries i that have seen the turquoise glaze fixed in the blue and quivering gaze of one whom cocaine can not daze how can i yield to women 's eyes i who can only turn away i that have held strong hands which palter borne the full weight of limbs that falter bound live flesh on the surgeon 's altar what need have i of women 's hand i that have felt the dead 's embrace i whose arms were his resting-place i that have kissed a dead man 's face ah but how should you understand now i can only turn away
i drowned in the fire of having you i burned in the river of not having you we lived together for hours in a house of a thousand rooms and we were parted for a thousand years ten minutes ago we raised our children who cover the earth and have forgotten that we existed it was not maya it was not a ladder to perfection it was this cold sunlight falling on this warm earth when i turned you went to hell when your ship fled the battle i followed you and lost the world without regret but with stormy recriminations someday far down that corridor of horror the future someone who buys this picture of you for the frame at a stall in a dwindled city will study your face and decide to harbor it for a little while longer from the waters of anonymity the acids of breath

to two scots lads lying in dug-outs joking idly wearily watching the candle guttering in the draught hearing the great shells go high over us eerily singing how often have i turned over and laughed with pity and pride photographs of all colours all sizes subjects khaki brothers in france or mother 's faces worn with countless dolours or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance though in a picture only a common cheap ill-taken card and children—frozen some babies waiting on dicky-bird to peep out of the handkerchief that is his home but he 's so shy and some with bright looks calling delight across the miles of land and sea that not the dread of barrage suddenly falling could quite blot out—not mud nor lethargy smiles and triumphant careless laughter o the pain of them wide earth 's most sacred things lying in dug-outs hearing the great shells slow sailing mile-high the heart mounts higher and sings but once—o why did he keep that bitter token of a dead love —that boy who suddenly moved showed me his eyes wet his low talk broken a girl who better had not been beloved

how can i tell you baby oh honey you'll never know the ride the ride of a lowered chevy slithering through the blue dotted night along riverside drive española poetry rides the wings of a ’ 59 impala yes it does and it points chrome antennae towards ’ burque stations rocking oldies van morrison brown eyed girls creedence and a bad moon rising over chimayo and i guess it also rides on muddy subarus tuned into new-age radio on the frigid road to taos on weekend ski trips yes baby you and i are two kinds of wheels on the same road listen listen to the lonesome humming of the tracks we leave behind
i. serious smiles a lot at least that ’ s what they say his mum and pop trying to be proud as all the nurses gather round to squint into the cloud of little serious on the ultrasound it ’ s likely just the way he ’ s bent the head nurse finally thunders into the awe and argument swirling through the crowd where someone mutters half-aloud in all my years… serious never hears serious spins and spins with his dumb dolphin grin in the best bed there is where there ’ s no guilt and no sin no child more inner than this nothing to will and nothing to want no body you both are and haunt no drug of disappointment or feeling that there ’ s never now or do these seep in somehow no suffering the world ’ s idiocy like a saint its pains no traffic and no planes no debts no taxes no phones and no faxes no rockslide of information called the internet serious isn ’ t yet 2. serious hears a sound not unusual in itself nothing to be concerned about here and there there ’ s been a shout a song he seemed to be inside the weird whale-calls of her gas this too shall pass then it comes again and with a far-off force which a shrink less serious than he will have him dream is a drain that all his impurity is slowly drifting toward down serious says down beyond which he ’ ll be clean feel no pain… then the dark erupts in a rain of blood and muck he seems to mostly be holding on for all he ’ s worth which isn ’ t much finally little wizened thing plopping out to an earth where cries of agony dwindle to equivocal joy it ’ s it ’ s…is it a boy and some clear world lies just beyond the eyes you can ’ t quite open and everything is wet and loud and broken and all of life is one huge tit you ’ re meant to somehow suck serious staggers to his feet slaps himself harder than the doctor did and says i ’ m fucked 3. serious is learning silence in the way most children learn to speak poshlust he gasps after his first feeding götterdämmerung in his first dusk his whole body writhing with a kind of violence as if the world had wounded him words his bleeding anomie deus absconditus drift into the air above his crib accursed progenitor quintessence of dust dribble with the pap onto his bib as day by day and week by week serious wrestles with this difficult gift forgetting which it seems he is on this earth to do boob ass oaf riving out of him like greatness going off ninny crackpate clunkhead gorm leaving him gasping and bent fragments sheep rabble all falling falling from him backwards into babble ... finally serious lies there spent language like some immense ghostly mobile bobbing just above his bed all power of movement gone as well useless little buglike arms buglike little fingers this heavy heavy head and now if there ’ s something serious can ’ t quite taste or if he feels too acutely his own waste or knows too acutely what he can ’ t tell he screams and screams until the world knows what serious means 4. serious goes to school just try it his mum says as she lets go his hand and wipes a last glaze of doughnut from his nose and serious insofar as serious can does give it a good try though it ’ s hard to understand why they keep taking a break from taking breaks or why they can ’ t simply walk in line down the hall or what finally is at stake in a game of kickball it ’ s time to draw a tree what a relief to work alone serious thinks as he picks a scab for just the right tinge of sky breaks his sugar cookie to make a place of stone and fashions out of bread a man with a huge head and huge ruined wings gasping at all the ruined things to which he ’ s tumbled and calls it cookie crumbled oh my the teacher says when she walks by those are interesting trees serious closes his eyes and sees as in a vision of doom himself drowning in schools a whole ocean of fools nipping nipping at him with their tiny tiny teeth and serious sighs with a prophet ’ s wisdom as he climbs up into his seat stares out across the room and like a prophet cries you ’ re all going to die the class is a tomb serious rigid waits a girl in pigtails giggles then another near the back and as if along a fuse the giggling goes up and down the rows till someone makes a crack about his coat and tie and the laughter detonates serious climbs slowly down into that inferno of sound which the teacher ’ s shouts are only driving higher packs up his lunchbox his dignity and his copy of sartre and strides with a prophet ’ s gaze through all that derisive fire only once does he turn briefly to look back through the blaze at the iron fact of his art smaller from here but unburned 5. serious loves his mum and then he doesn ’ t quite it ’ s that way with everything— baths and plums the blessèd silence of night would you like to help with this his mother asks as she rolls out biscuit dough and cuts it with a glass or folds the clothes still warm from the sun but serious knows he was born with a task and though he touches the clothes and tastes the dough serious says no serious stays in the bath until his skin is shriveled and cold eats himself sick on plums feels in the dark the dark he becomes and cries out in the night for his mum 6. serious is older now he just is thank god serious says for whom childhood that stupid carousel that never stops always had an element of disingenuousness the tristesse of lollipops the sham of naps fools dandling you on their laps so you can play horsey which damn sure isn ’ t serious and all that endless business of pretending to be curious about the most obvious things what ’ s night where ’ s mama-cat what ’ s wrong with pop can god die why why why to hell with that serious thinks as he sits incinerating memories one by one saying their names as he feeds them like photographs to a fire here he is in a baseball uniform squinting back the sun here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front and here lord with pimples he pauses a moment do memories have names and what exactly are these flames to hell with that done serious owns a car pays taxes contemplates a pension has a crease of gray along his temples but he is young young he develops headaches begins sleeping badly and relaxes you might say into the constant tension that he really always was with far far too much to do to look anywhere but onward or to answer the questions of a child with anything true 7. serious isn ’ t stupid though they go to the same gym serious sees him dropping weights or picking his butt and thinks at least i ’ m not him nor is he mean or vain those chiseled twins with matching boots and belts nor smug who notes their sins nor shallow noting something else he isn ’ t useless timid who no matter what won ’ t complain nor fat-assed nice sweating honey on all the machines nor self-loathing who smudges mirrors nor whacked who licks them clean serious isn ’ t funny serious spreads his towel on the bench sits down in front of his own image and serious strains at a serious weight and never not once when he ’ s seen in myriad mirrors around the room that everyone else is straining too has he caught himself too late and finished with a roar and more strength than he ’ s ever had before i am not you 8. serious has a date with doom it ’ s not the first and seems unlikely to be the last for they get on quite well doom and he share similar pasts and similar ideas about what life should be it seems in fact that this might just bloom and what a relief after morose and mad and neurotic after almost falling for grief who was so exotic she made all the others seem tame then to discover she even lied about her name and to sleep with another serious that was odd like wrestling with an angel though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle which one was serious and which one god but how easy it is to be himself with doom serious thinks as he puts the wine in to chill and sets two glasses on a tray who always wants whatever serious wants and always agrees with what he has to say who doesn ’ t need to hear that whole spiel about “ going too fast ” or “ needing more room ” and who doesn ’ t probe and pry that long needle into his brain —what do you feel what do you feel — until it ’ s all serious can do not to stand up and scream pain lucky to be alive and if he still has no clear idea where she lives and never knows quite when she ’ ll arrive still something about doom feels right to serious and he looks forward to their dates he checks himself in the mirror dims the light and waits 9. serious is a traveler “ traveling broadens the mind ” the man beside him says his tray table down and seat reclined even as they 're taking off and serious who has his eyes closed so he can do what serious does begins to cough what do they say what do they fear is this song joy or grief this is a man this is a god who are you and why are you here to leave to leave the meal is over which serious declined in the shell-roar of the cabin he eases somewhat is surprised to find he could almost drift away “ what line of work are you in ” he hears the man beside him say and serious begins coughing wildly again what is that smell what was that sound isn ’ t that ice on the wings this is the air there is the water but what do you do on the way down you scream you scream how far they must have gone by now that old familiar world miles behind the man eats an orange and now he eats the rind he eats his plate his plastic fork chews with animal relish his styrofoam cup leans over to eat bittersweet serious too who startles and wakes up look at the desert look at the green is there an end to that ice here is a place and here is a place but what is the space between it ’ s life it ’ s life 10. serious is married what a weird wind this is he thinks so still at times then stinging the eyes to tears and how he seems both more and less himself and how it seems at once all of loneliness and something he can hold or is it he who 's being carried he shivers and reaches out for her again or is it she who reaches she who 's cold what is this wind where are these years 11. serious experiences loss just like that flat serious experiences loss as if he ’ d come to some sheer cliff there was no way around no way to cross and found on the other side of a deep canyon himself experiencing loss serious when the man is gone tells himself that he tried tells himself that he cried and cried for all he was worth to the man sitting on the other side experiencing loss who one day simply vanished or moved on or slipped off the edge of the earth and died 12. serious doesn ’ t speak french this embarrasses serious because insofar as he lives anywhere serious lives in paris he feels the city stare feels himself sweat and shake as he tries to wrench the little that he ’ s gleaned into the lot that he desires feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar waiters as if he were unclean and feels in truth not at all serious as if he had a huge balloon for a head and helium squeaks for a voice as if gravity could be merely a choice he were making and he might instead simply stop let go and drift away finally serious opposed to epiphanies has one he can ’ t resist he is serious and to be serious is to know something utterly or not at all and to know moreover that as you let your half-knowledge fall from you it does not exist just like that serious is himself again saying weighty things about the flowers in the stalls pondering a splendid mirage called the seine and if he wakes saying fromage or in some shop feels right on the verge of translating please serious knows it ’ s a dream and knows from childhood what to do point and scream until the damn fools give you cheese 13. serious has some culture he knows some things and if as he begins to speak he should feel the immense wings of ignorance shadowing him that dirty vulture that squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice serious knows what shelter to seek pick a name and bach is better modernism was powerful but diffuse life ’ s drained out of pictures since the renaissance technique technique technique and about all that spastic flatulence called contemporary art well serious hardly knows where to start serious sits through opera without a yawn chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter he can tell you where one brushstroke lies list the reasons courtly love is gone pluck the speck of subject matter from henry james serious knows some things he thinks and thinks and thinks until his ignorance shrinks to the tiniest of flies alighting somewhere in the louvre carefully carefully serious creeps with his massive swatter saying don ’ t move don ’ t move 14. serious believes in nothing it ’ s a nice day what should we do what are you thinking what ’ s been bothering you what ’ s that you ’ re drinking serious spreads the paper on his lap to confirm what ’ s new under the sun hears a tap tap tap against the windowpane nothing ventured nothing gained floats up from childhood like a bit of ash and serious pausing can almost see his old preacher that atom bomb of idiocy who every sunday would explode still serious thinks there ’ s a truth to set you free but who could survive the blast tap tap tap serious skims the sports pages reads about a storm that rages far out at sea some talking dog is taking office some country wiping out monuments expunging its past tap tap tap goddammit serious says midway through a war and thinks again of that old bore who talked and talked and talked until you felt your head loll and sway like some huge flower on a tiny stalk that one good breeze would break and how you ’ d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak chicken fried man with a tiny transistor radio in his hand so he could listen to the football game and how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain if he saw you coming to his booth and he stared off as if some great truth were finally finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain and like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout— until what plopped innocuously out was your own name tap tap tap serious puts aside the news of the day and walks to the only window there is but there ’ s no wind not even the grass stirs and anyway there ’ s no tree serious shrugs and turns away must just be me 13. serious sees a child in the playground across the street sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet as he tries to keep up with the games and hears his sonar screams of delight amid the other children 's screams and hears his timid weeping when they call him names serious sees the child standing apart sometimes driveling to himself in silly rhymes and sees him pretend to look intently at the sky if serious walks by or sees him simply stop and stare gradually serious starts seeing the child everywhere in a store standing in an aisle in the subway while serious is trying to work on the way home or laughing with his family in a restaurant where serious eats alone serious knows the truth this child wants something his whole nature is want and it begins to be annoying this novice cringing all the imbecilic and cloying tactics of being cute the whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity with his freckles and his missing tooth sitting all fidgety in his sunday suit or babbling happily as he ’ s leaking snot and then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious when it ’ s so obvious he ’ s not serious sees the child in the playground standing to the side sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide as serious crosses the street and strides until his shadow swallows the child and leans down close enough for them to kiss i don ’ t have time for this serious says i ’ ve got too much to do and the child says who are you 16. serious kills himself no no shivering out of a dream starlight and the hard glitter under the bridge ’ s beam serious serious don ’ t go serious crawls out of bed feels the cold in the floor and thinks suddenly of lovely mad where can she be who ’ d bolt out of sleep and scream farmers get up at four it ’ s three serious makes himself a cup of coffee which he doesn ’ t drink tries and fails to read tries and fails to think serious sits and holds himself still minute by minute until the dawn finally comes and he is in it 17. serious lives alone it ’ s better this way he tells himself as he takes a pan from the pan shelf a spatula from the spatula drawer and fries two eggs the way he likes them yolks of stone no more gnats of chatter over breakfast no more breakfast it ’ s noon no one prancing by with only panties on when he ’ s almost almost broken through or singsonging outside his door serious o serious where are you no more but what finally does serious do he sits ignores the ringing phone looks at a wall on one of the last warm days of the year and settles back into the lifelong call of being serious which is to see within that whiteness leaves being gently blown and to feel their colors as they fall 18. serious gives a speech he sets his papers on the podium his glass within easy reach tap tap taps the microphone how vast this venue is how absolute this darkness to be serious is to be alone serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face waiting for the echoes to end out there in all that space which the words at once define and extend it takes a while but they do die the spotlight lasers in he blinks hard starts again to know in every hand another ’ s touch to hear a silence words only intensify to feel not too little but too much this attenuated world— serious begins to sweat feels the back of his shirt grow wet looks down to see his papers swirled and scattered the glass on the floor broken what ’ s with this fucking light he thinks or was it spoken he glares out at the dark impassive crowd and as if by force he could make them wake hears his voice growing loud whatever you most treasure you will break whatever you hold closest you will let go there is no place that you will not leave but to be serious— serious says quietly now because he has them they are his— to be serious to be truly serious is to know that what you call your losses you can not grieve for it was never quite these things that you wanted —this treasure this touch this one place— but by such life to be haunted brilliant no notes no flaws serious stands back and waits for applause the hall is silent utterly silent the heat tropic serious looks around confused turns to the man who introduced him then can ’ t remember being introduced and even given his credentials this suddenly seems a most unlikely topic serious tries to get out of the light but the light goes where serious goes he blunders to the edge of the stage a cliff breaking off into a dark in which there 's no movement no voices not one sigh serious feels the rage draining out of him and feels a chill and whispers where am i 19. serious nears an end it ’ s cold and getting colder and serious older sits outside thinking of his good friend who like so much of serious is gone and thinking of that godforsaken dawn after the one night of his life he spent outdoors tell me his good friend said when serious staggered out to the fire which form would you say is higher tragedy or comedy and serious who had stumbled full-bladdered in the night from a dream of bears then dreamed himself the object of a dozen hungry stares who had swiveled pissed into the tent and sworn such things it would take a life to repent serious exhausted serious was silent because it ’ s been troubling me serious that the answer can only be tragedy to be conscious is to be conscious of losing whatever it is that you most love and thus an art that 's truly great will always have one deepest truth to tell which is my friend this life is hell serious looks at the sky it ’ s late a small wind blows the trees and serious shivering knows he should head inside that he is not well but sitting here letting his eyes close serious can almost see that lake aflame with the early sun and smell the sweet burn of that wood and feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break were it not for the strange lightness in his head as his friend smiled and said but maybe earth is the heaven of the good 20. serious talks to god there ’ s no one else left his mind is mash his world is ash and serious occasionally forgets himself though he is not not bereft that sniveling idiot two doors down who sits up late with only ashes in the grate and talks to god see serious says see nothing serious spreads his arms magnanimously as if to give god the floor god declines thou know ’ st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry serious says louder than before and then we wawl and cry some more and then we die and then we rot again he waits in case there ’ s disagreement there ’ s not serious scoffs goes to brush his teeth forgets briefly to avert his eye from the mirror ’ s glare and finds his father there that gentle baffled man who when there was no hope when he couldn ’ t even stand carved from a piece of soap a silly yellow duck and set it in a little yellow dish serious feels a tingling in his hair and mutters something close to a prayer i wish i wish ... the lights go out goddammit serious shouts as he trips and falls to his knees on the floor banging his head on the door as he tries to rise goddammit serious cries the lights come on his father ’ s gone but there at the edge of the sink balances the little duck in the little dish no serious person would ever keep serious tries to think steadies himself as if at some brink decides he needs sleep that ’ s what he needs crawling fully clothed into his bed and pulling the covers to his chin because it seems there ’ s some strange wind that ’ s somehow gotten inside so unlike serious to leave a door unclosed yet here it is gathering strength as it blows his books on the floor and it blows right through his body and it blows behind and below and above and out of the whirlwind a voice cries love what serious says as he tries to sit upright and looks wildly around him raising his fist in the air the things ... i have lost— immediately he is tossed back against the wall by the force of a storm that has no source no form and hears again the call out of nowhere love my god serious screams unable to help himself what maundering politician what decerebrated pop star what stupid puling poet couldn ’ t tell me that struggling to get out of bed he starts to cough then choke a riot in his heart a riot in his head as he falls off the edge to the floor who do you think you are he gasps is this ... is this some sort of joke suddenly the strange wind is quiet but no less strange the calm that comes after i ’ m serious the voice says and serious dies of laughter epilogue the dead man ’ s famous no one now remembers him alive or knows his name or anything he did still a few stories survive after all this while of a weird-looking man with a weird-looking smile that had it ’ s said almost a kind of life to it though the man was seriously dead and some remember how all the flies vanished for miles and some say no no but the buzzards had weird smiles as if they knew something and some tell of an old woman who would come and whisper in the dead man ’ s ear and smooth the dead man ’ s hair and if the door opened disappear there are even stories of that grim mortician who thought the smile undignified and tugged and tugged so hard he slipped and fell inside right on top of the dead man whose lips he swore seemed to soften seemed to somehow kiss and some remember this before the lid was sealed on that coffin and the nails driven there were on that face real tears and some say he smiled like a man forgiven the dead man never hears the dead man spins and spins with his dumb dolphin grin through all the places where he is when people talk of him again in classrooms or in planes in boredom or in pain in front of screens or in the spotlight ’ s glare in days too mild to bear and in the long nights where the dark grows steep the wind wild and a mother rises from her sleep to calm her serious child
meanwhile the sea moves uneasily like a man who suspects what the room reels with as he rises into it is violation—his own he touches the bruises at each shoulder and on his chest the larger bruise star-shaped a flawed star or hand though he remembers no hands has tried—ca n't remember that kind of rhythm to it even to the roughest surf there 's a rhythm findable which is why we keep coming here to find it or that's what we say we dive in and as usual the swimming feels like that swimming the mind does in the wake of transgression how the instinct to panic at first slackens that much more quickly if you don't look back regret like pity changes nothing really we say to ourselves and less often to each other each time swimming a bit farther leaving the shore the way the water—in its own watered of course version of semaphore–keeps leaving the subject out flashing why should it matter now and why why shouldn 't it as the waves beat harder hard against us until that's how we like it i 'll break your heart break mine
even if we won ’ t admit it getting off the subway at canal st. — i wonder if the author is a man or a woman a teen a team

the whole trick of this thing ... is to get out of your own light — marianne faithfull she said she sang very close to the mike to change the space and i changed the space by striding down the boulevard raspail at dusk in tight jeans until an algerian engineer plucked the pen from my back pocket as if you ’ re inside my head and you ’ re hearing the song from in there he came from the desert i came from green suburbs we understood nothing of one another over glasses of metallic red wine i was playing girl he played man several plots were afoot all misfiring one had to do with my skimpy black shirt and light hair his broad shoulders and hunger after months on an oil rig another was untranslatable apollinaire burned his fingers on june ’ s smoldering lyre but i had lost my pen the engineer read only construction manuals his room was dim and narrow and no the story didn ’ t slide that way though there are many ways to throw oneself away one singer did it by living by a broken wall until she shredded her voice but still she offered each song she said like an appalachian artifact like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quay plastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dolls through which the current chortles an intimate tune
the fist clenched round my heart loosens a little and i gasp brightness but it tightens again when have i ever not loved the pain of love but this has moved past love to mania this has the strong clench of the madman this is gripping the ledge of unreason before plunging howling into the abyss hold hard then heart this way at least you live
i 'm sorry i can not say i love you when you say you love me the words like moist fingers appear before me full of promise but then run away to a narrow black room that is always dark where they are silent elegant like antique gold devouring the thing i feel i want the force of attraction to crush the force of repulsion and my inner and outer worlds to pierce one another like a horse whipped by a man i do n't want words to sever me from reality i do n't want to need them i want nothing to reveal feeling but feeling—as in freedom or the knowledge of peace in a realm beyond or the sound of water poured in a bowl
there 's a black bear in the apple tree and he wo n't come down i can hear him panting like an athlete i can smell the stink of his body come down black bear can you hear me the mind is the most interesting thing to me like the sudden death of the sun it seems implausible that darkness will swallow it or that anything is lost forever there like a black bear in a fruit tree gulping up sour apples with dry sucking sounds or like us at the pier somber and tired making food from sunlight you saying a word me saying a word trying hard though things were disintegrating still i wanted you your lips on my neck your postmodern sexuality forlorn and anonymous i did n't want to be that i could hear the great barking monsters of the lower waters calling me forward you see my mind takes me far but my heart dreams of return black bear with pale-pink tongue at the center of his face is turning his head like the face of christ from life shaking the apple boughs he is stronger than i am and seems so free of passion— no fear no pain no tenderness i want to be that come down black bear i want to learn the faith of the indifferent
it was your birthday we had drunk and dined half of the night with our old friend who 'd showed us in the end to a bed i reached in one drunk stride already i lay snug and drowsy with the wine dozed on one side i dozed i slept my sleep broke on a hug suddenly from behind in which the full lengths of our bodies pressed your instep to my heel my shoulder-blades against your chest it was not sex but i could feel the whole strength of your body set or braced to mine and locking me to you as if we were still twenty-two when our grand passion had not yet become familial my quick sleep had deleted all of intervening time and place i only knew the stay of your secure firm dry embrace
you go from me in june for months on end to study equanimity among high trees alone i go out with a new boyfriend and stay all summer in the city where home mostly on my own i watch the sunflowers flare you travel east to help your relatives the rainy season 's start at least brings you from banishment and from the hall a doorway gives a glimpse of you writing i do n't know what through winter with head bent in the lamp 's yellow spot to some fresh task some improvising skill your face is turned of which i ask nothing except the presence beneath white hair your clear eyes still are candid as the cat 's fixed narrowing gaze —its pale-blue incandescence in your room nowadays sociable cat without much noise or fuss we left the kitchen where he sat and suddenly we find he happens still to be with us in this room now though firmly faced away not to be left behind though all the night he 'll stray as you began you 'll end the year with me we 'll hug each other while we can work or stray while we must nothing is or will ever be mine i suppose no one can hold a heart but what we hold in trust we do hold even apart
i lift—lift you five states away your glass wide of this bar you never graced where none ever i know came where what work is done even by these men i know not where a brass police-car sign peers in wet strange cars pass soiled hangs the rag of day out over this town a juke-box brains air where i drink alone the spruce barkeep sports a toupee alas— my glass i lift at six o'clock my darling as you plotted chinese couples shift in bed we shared today not even filthy weather beasts in the hills their tigerish love are snarling suddenly they clash i blow my short ash red grey eyes light and we have our drink together
i was a man and i was trying to save a woman in danger i picked her up in my arms and flew flying like a frog swimming in air i ditched our nameless pursuer and landed there was a guy waiting for us who looked like a king caught now i have to accept the punishment for saving the woman first we have to take a shower the effect is to loosen the skin from the muscle until it peels off the woman picks up the pieces of my skin and holds them in her hands and says i will love each of these as i loved you and i thought this is what is called fetish and suddenly it came to me that the origin of the word is fe- as in female soft loving silken — plus -tissue like tissues flying voicing particles waking in waves over a living body of water loose at last
the trouble with paradise is you never want to be away from home i make what calls me out all gone before you know it words may drop passing color yet seeing you here now are born again and again closing a word in the mouth feels the sound until the tongue ca n't stay still to unmask is to go silent language makes no promise to communicate an articulated sound has its own dream in the ear her presence in the room gives aroma to the syllables i voice now she 's ready to draw eros from foreign bodies it starts by focusing on the sounds beyond hearing still felt by she i mean who speaking animate configures this is the time of alternative obscurities to see through through thoroughly as a word weighs
when we gathered at the house while the men all looked at their shoes and the women whispered baby baby baby she sat down with a fist full of paper napkins and folded them into birds when she filled her hands she crossed the room to the hearth and threw a bird into the flames then another then another until she had destroyed all she created years later when i asked her what she meant she couldn ’ t remember the worst has already happened she said what good is metaphor to us now
up — or out — here a problem of preposition my uneasy relation with the world whether i ’ m above it or apart on the other side of the latched glass door a man loves me worries calls my name • where — for art — thou- sands of windows go dark in slow succession on essex and ludlow and orchard a thousand times goodnight • a boy throwing stones at a window right window wrong boy • love goes toward love — and the place death down there waving its white kerchief —
beneath all this i ’ m carving a cathedral of salt i keep the entrance hidden no one seems to notice the hours i ’ m missing ... i ’ ll bring you one night it ’ s where i go when i hang up the phone ... neither you nor your soul is waiting for me at the end of this i know that the salt nearly clear after i chisel out the pews the see-through altar the opaque panes of glass that depict the stations of our cross — here is the day we met here is the day we remember we met ... the air down here will kill us some say some wear paper masks some still imagine the air above the green trees thick with bees building solitary nests out of petals what ’ s the name for this ineffable the endless white will blind you some say but what is there to see we haven ’ t already seen some say it ’ s like poking a stick into a river — you might as well simply write about the stick or the river
but how choose the appropriate sticking point to start at who wants to write a poem without the letter e especially for thee where the flourished vowel lends such panache to your carnet de bal ok peons pizzazz to your dance card the alphabet ’ s such a horn of plenty why cork up its treasure it hurts to think of “ you ” reduced to u in stingy text messages as if ideally expression should be limited to formulas like x ≠ y where the respectable truth of tautology leaves ambiguous beauty standing by waiting to take off her clothes if that is her percentage of body fat permits it a statement implicitly unfair as if beauty to remain sublime had to keep up lineaments already shaped by uninhibited divinity implying as well fixated onlookers i.e. men and women kidding themselves that full-front-and-back nudity is the north star of delight rather than imagined nakedness shudderingly draped like a fully rigged fully laden ship without a drop to bail its hidden cargoes guessed at — perhaps samian wine mad- making — or fresh basil gently crushed by its own slight weight reviving memories of delights once stumbled on as a boy delights often wreathed with necessary pain like the stout unforgiving thorns that tear shirt and skin as we stretch for ripe blackberries to be gulped down fast sweeter than butter and marmalade quenching our thirst better than sucked ice making us almost drunk as we shriek with false contempt at each benighted ump who decides against our teams what happened to those blissful fruits honeydew purple plum white raspberry for stealing which from mrs. grossman ’ s stand i invented ingenious alibis that she never believed insulting or what where are childhood ’ s innocent sweetnesses like homemade rice pudding and mince pie or the delicious resistances of various foods — bony lobsters chops with their succulent tiny interstices corn sticking to the cob or the grilled feast of brook trout i caught without too much fuss after kicking a resentful hornets ’ nest and when carnality replaced appetite i was communally pronounced the horniest ten-year-old around and i hadn ’ t even seen you but when i did you became the plume in the horse ’ s hat of my lust i was thirteen when we first danced together there weren ’ t many afters but i cherish my plume there weren ’ t any afters nothing just a gentle abseil i could not climb back up i still wave my plume or my horse does as he canters nobly into next year my eighty-fifth i hasten to add that “ this coyness lady were no crime ” if i didn ’ t in spite of all feel so grateful to you all manner of mercis fill my throat along with immortal memories of which i must acknowledge the thorniest to be your disappearance whether you tanked in river water or were scorched by zeus ’ s proximity or some such baloney but your firm breasts taut nipples and bent thighs no thorns all you wanted was a loosened peplum so i still bear your plume and your name will not die not to be written here or read but my voice shall sibilate it so shrilly that unseeded babies hear me and every hidden woodworm wake from its dream to fall forever from the rafters
there is the torch and the only thing that will prevent us from using it is whether or not we can allow jellyfish in the otherwise crystalline surf it would be easy to dismiss this view as beautiful and walk away because it is buggy and we forgot the spray to cancel the conversation because its ease is perilous with conjunctions to not touch because the sky would separate from the sky and the mothership would fall through with a banner waving in a language we wouldn ’ t understand though the meaning is as clear as these intercontinental contrails hatching mackerel sky saying we are full we are full of sound and fury we are signifying nothing damned universal law damned categorical imperative elbowing its way between my hands and your face the sparrows again exploding against windows as a circle of men sitting outside the cafe while away their intentions with invisible motor tics they can ’ t even feel unless the right empire of light covers every last inch of them and brings to the surface the names — those loves they chose to stable and there it is the choice — if only the metaphor were more complex if i could only adverb away my existence and say what a remarkable sunday this is a perfect sunday and turn my breath to stone i ’ ve done it before i spoke the language of sweating cavern walls and electric light but i won ’ t go there again we are all and only our distances and when we touch that is what we touch our messy shelves our sullen privations and overabundance of lemons our grief our mountains and fields and rivers of grief our dismissals and the love we ignore when we don ’ t run after the sparrows because the sparrows will fly away my sparrow fly away if you have to but know that i am coming i am low in the grass i am burning with patience i am every song i know all the math in the shore says you shouldn ’ t but my distance is yours if you want it and it is yours if you don ’ t dandelions and honeysuckle surround me the world ’ s ineluctable fire is looking right at me and i am making my stand
you ’ re flush with hearts and i ’ m forced to fold this hand and swear off another luckless match how we ’ ve found ways to love each other cajoled our cindered hearts flushed and forced to fold upon themselves like saint valentine ensouled with seizure skin a whirring bee swarm a hatched flush of doves my heart how i ’ m forced to fold my hands in prayer for another struck match
yes i was jealous when you threw the glass i wanted the shattering against the wood-paneled floor for myself to be the sudden diaspora of its pieces across the apartment — and last night when we fought i wanted you to hit me so badly i begged and the other day walking past renewal-on-the-bowery when one of the men smoking unsteadily outside called me a faggot i thought good people get what they deserve then i wished i were more like jesus — capable of loving all people and all things always capable of nothing but love i waste half my wishes this way wishing to be virtuous the rest well i don ’ t have to tell you do i
you and i thigh deep in suwannee river then in a bathtub spanish moss clogs the drain and a man carrying a green towel interrupts we send him away once more knowing he 'll return to watch we 're photographers shooting on location for sylvia plath 's upcoming book savage beauty—wrong poet or wrong book i know depending on how you look at it—however i 'm the one who is white this time you 're darker maybe quechua indian or spanish like actor antonio banderas with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis years later i write a book about our affair they bring me on one of those daytime talk shows and before being reunited we are kept in separate rooms the television split screen green-towel man in the audience i 'm still white so are you both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair later i 'm the viewer at home thinking like hell they 'll fall for each other
it was as if her love had become a big eye or some historical logic or a religious particle lodged in the brain in the most costly services of a great society one may find the allure of a benign intelligence i have hoped since i was a child to be surrounded by a group of articulate characters who might with gracious friendship provide some essential entertainment as aaron ’ s which was a cane and then a snake and then a cane again great clouds of smoke from the forest itsy bugs amarch my naked legs in my beard to burn as one might with one ’ s eyes i learned but can no longer remember with what dignity another ’ s care imbues one you sit and pick the lice from my hair what sort of life is this
when you walked in it was like recognizing the moon when he returns his lover bites his cheek she has no choice all we see is the dissolution then await the reconstruction each time the sky yanks her into his orbit i want to say i ’ m sorry i want to say you win our bodies are like the confessional booth these poems are stuck in even the priest can see that sin you ’ ll be all spit and honey— or maybe i ’ m the poisoned flower gnawing on its own lip because it has no hands to reach for you only words that are as useless as the pollen for saying anything i continue to serve them even with your hands around my throat from across the room your voice is home i answer it like a bat guided across the atmosphere this is a narrative that can not end well but wants to but must i ’ ll continue to go down kicking and you ’ ll be sweet as anything until you bite back no it can ’ t end here—we won ’ t let it billions of years have passed since an asteroid last hit the moon clearly some magnetic fields can be sustained
in the next room peter ’ s gloved hands crack cordoned-off spines he has been granted permission his agent ’ s call his pedigree so the tour itself is only the docent and me he is docile eager to please leads me up the stairs and takes me to the bed the coverlet is authentic he says he lectures me on the heating system offers an anecdote of a broken casserole recites all of the welty lore he has rehearsed she taught him when he was young and now he serves her legend lets me lean in toward the books—i cross the line of what ’ s allowed never touching he shows me photos—two loves lost one a married man—then on the way down pauses before a feather in a box reciting yeats ’ s “ leda and the swan. ” he begins to weep at let her drop adds like welty ’ s loves now i stop— is he comparing her to the god or leda he can not bear her her unfulfilled love i can not bear this either—how dare he conjure up for her such disappointment such wasted longing i want to be the mirror of her photographs to be her figure of my own conjuring i want to believe i too could be happy here in this solitary house in this small town amidst the rows and stacks of books untouched
i believe that witness is a magnitude of vulnerability that when i say love what i mean is not a feeling nor promise of a feeling i believe in attention my love for you is a monolith of try the woman i love pays an inordinate amount of attention to large and small objects she is not described by anything because i could not mean anything else she knows exactly what i mean once upon a time a line saw itself clear to its end i have seen the shape of happiness y=mx+b i am holding it it is your hand
last time i saw myself die is when police killed jessie hernandez a 17 year old brown queer // who was sleeping in their car yesterday i saw myself die again // fifty times i died in orlando // i remember reading // dr. josé esteban muñoz before he passed i was studying at nyu // where he was teaching // where he wrote shit that made me feel like a queer brown survival was possible // but he didn ’ t survive now // on the dancefloor // in the restroom // on the news // in my chest there are another fifty bodies that look like mine // are dead // i ’ ve been marching for black lives talking about police brutality against native communities too // for years now // but this morning i feel it // i really feel it again // how can we imagine ourselves // we being black native today // brown people // how can we imagine ourselves when all the dead boys look like us // once i asked my nephew where he wanted to go to college // what career he would like // as if the whole world was his for the choosing // once he answered me without fearing tombstones or cages or the hands from a father // the hands of my lover yesterday praised my whole body // made angels from my lips // ave maria full of grace // he propped me up like the roof of a cathedral // in nyc before we opened the news read // read about people who think two brown queers can ’ t build cathedrals // only cemeteries // each time we kiss a funeral plot opens // in the bedroom i accept his kiss // i lose my reflection i ’ m tired of writing this poem // but i want to say one last word about yesterday // my father called // i heard him cry for only the second time in my life he sounded like he loved me // it ’ s something i ’ m rarely able to hear i hope // if anything // his sound is what my body remembers first
i only have a moment so let me tell you the shortest story about arriving at a long loved place the house of friends in maine their lawn of wildflowers their grandfather clock and candid portraits their gabled attic rooms and woodstove in the kitchen all accessories of the genuine summer years before when i was their son ’ s girlfriend and tied an apron behind my neck beneath my braids and took from their garden the harvest for a dinner i would make alone and serve at their big table with the gladness of the found and loved the eggplant shone like polished wood the tomatoes smelled like their furred collars the dozen zucchini lined up on the counter like placid troops with the onions their minions and i even remember the garlic each clove from its airmail envelope brought to the cutting board ready for my instruction and in this very slight story a decade later i came by myself having been dropped by the airport cab and waited for the family to arrive home from work i walked into the lawn waist-high in the swaying purple lupines the subject of june ’ s afternoon light as i had never been addressed — a displaced young woman with cropped hair no place to which i wished to return and no one to gather me in his arms that day the lupines received me and i was in love with them because they were all i had left and in that same manner i have loved much of the world since then and who is to say there is more of a reason or more to love
shiraishi called upon the great sky cock wanted an explanation wondered why the echo of form without the wisdom why the bent wit without the timing wondered as i have how a man bare upon the bed may rise as if in praise but fail to be grateful for the gift at hand o dick of questionable devise o schlong of longing as present but ultimately unknowable as your maker i would worship at the fount if i had more faith if i knew your weeping eye was on me alone
of that string of memories about our lost friendship i remember being invited places as a pair like a comedy team and after one party our self-parody of our own stammering speechlessness when introduced to henrik the swedish god auto mechanic our twin garish purple-flowered swimsuits from kmart outlining around texas our sameness and differences our dual waitressing shifts across town and the long phone calls that followed with their emphatic reiteration of every stingy six-top ordering candy-flavored alcoholic drinks the after-work visit where we brayed stomped then blinked stupidly while the needle hit the lp ’ s end at the empty fifth of gin left on the coffee table prompting a dim uh oh your imitation of your mother ’ s habitual and by-the-way inexplicable confession about you to shoe salesmen she has a funny foot the apartments the olivettis the boyfriends all the thoughts exchanged unedited like an experiment of the big walk-in consciousness which we might have assumed the verbal equivalent of sex for friends and whatever closeness meant we wanted as much as we could have it was our post-graduate work in the humanities even now i can ’ t resist striking up a conversation while standing on line any line or introducing myself enthusiastically to whomever i am introduced but the truth is i am not looking for new friends at this point i am trying to locate the lost ones the ones who left through the hole of an argument decades ago a time more panicked and carefree than any other except maybe the early years of motherhood which i missed sharing with you on playground benches but surely i will see you on the bus someday and your greeting will package our jokes advice tears book talk our years of reliance and so i will expect you will tell me how much i have misunderstood and wrongly assumed in these descriptions because i never expect those people who have mattered to remain completely gone even through death or rebuke and of course i have to remember what parted us that i found faults with your other friends that i spoke as critically and crassly about them as i did about my own person and to this day i have to be careful of that trait my junkyard dog of expression safe only with me on a too-long leash here again telling you everything with no reason but for memory ’ s insistence that i string an apology from what i see
in reality my loves are the strange box of a polish doll the blonde ’ s eyes appearing fixed to her hips long after midnight the garret always singular to loosen a massive mane across her back its strands thick and fine draping her otter-like chin deliberately she ’ d peer out from the wall and nothing could be seen but the shadow of her breasts hidden beneath marmots of hair and lovely was her skin ’ s radiance at that unusual hour her waist ’ s digressions easily discerned as bees through grass the window neither open nor closed what i saw yellow like crystal rose from sleepy thighs amassed in unseemly tourniquets everything before me a pale shimmer of hairs fanning delicately to reveal the pink or green skin i no longer know of hips a million centimeters from my gaze

in our arteries and eyes a hundred lightbulbs throb like drugs the furnace a permanent mishap and up in the dusk there is lucid debris— a conduit a wire mask a swastika of corn boy- and/or girl-small we 'll find some horizon an intricate faking in which to lose way here we are not speaking or dead here we are or dead to what do we owe this forgetting not to kiss not that any given face is not afraid

—at dubai international airport and ending with a line by césar vallejo because i must walk through the eye-shaped shadows cast by these curved gold leaves thick atop each constructed palm tree past displays of silk scarves lit silhouettes of blue-bottled perfume—because i grip as though for the first time a paper bag of french fries from mcdonald 's and lick from each fingertip the fat and salt as i stand alone to the side of this moving walkway gliding me past dark- eyed men who do not look away when i stare squarely back—because standing in line to the restroom i want only to pluck from her black sweater this one shimmering blond hair clinging fast— because i must rest the coke cold in my hand beside this toilet seat warmed by her thighs her thighs and hers here at the narrow mouth of this long humid corridor leading to the plane i take my place among this damp dark horde of men and women who look like me— because i look like them— because i am ashamed of their bodies that reek so unabashedly of body— because i can—because i am an american a star of blood on the surface of muscle

today there has been so much talk of things exploding into other things so much that we all become curious that we all run outside into the hot streets and hug romance is a grotto of eager stones anticipating light or a girl whose teeth you can always see with more sparkle and pop is the only way to live your confetti tongue explodes into acid jazz small typewriters that other people keep in their eyes click away at all our farewell parties it is hard to pack for the rest of your life someone is always eating cold cucumber noodles someone will drop by later to help dismantle some furniture a lot can go wrong if you sleep or think but the trees go on waving their broken little hands

on one occasion yūgen of ise province was offering to share for a night or two the comforts of his home with me when a distant bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day then to a degree i would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice so worn out not even sure i was on the right road i forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand-in-hand in the same direction both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire but i am so tired i heard my own voice say one of them that startlingly cruel intrusive voice i hate darkening everything how sick i am of listening to it and of having to go on but after some time had passed once again i forgot all about it as i sat there the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or perhaps a hidden joy of my own one i had so long considered extinct when yūgen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking renga competitions and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again i think of her sometimes moon come down and come alone i have to tell you all about akechi ’ s wife — bashō translated by franz wright

in green water i saw your eye and in it i saw that arabian palace filled with birds and broken glass i copy an address into my right hand and fill myself with memories of psalms a green fish emerges from seaweed as seaweed from a wave that rises like the wailing wall my sun-baked body at the edge wind in my lungs its whistle my torn world my grief my soggy passport my shell with no pearl you lift them delicate cloud into a liquid world last night i dreamed of my father 's flabby body and of my blue resolve to run away to find a way i dreamed of your eye and for an instant i found the vertex of the road the imaginary line that falls across the earth that meridian where the sun on a tiger 's back meets the shade at its belly waking up we are swallowed by wakefulness the house swallows us in its terrible thirst the routine of taking our children to school swallows us and so does the if only i could there was something to that dream you know it a direction a way a forest as green as you and your roots give me your premonitions give me your book give me your prodigious memory give me the blue gaze from your dark eye give me the devotion of your sleeping birds sometimes the way is a fire through which the circus tiger leaps a perfect circle returning to me with its stripes intact and with the endless continuity of this ineluctably feral world
lean and sane in the last hour of a long fast or fiercer discipline he could touch dust into a sudden surge of limbs and speak leaves in the night air above him inhabit quiet so wholly he heard roots inch into the unfeeling earth rings increasing inside of that tree without moving hardly breathing he could call out of the long darkness walls around him a house whose each room he knew its hoard of silences solitudes doors opening onto the wide fields through which he moved breathing deeply unbewildered by the dead with their hands of wind their faces of cloud stilled and gifted in the last hour before the first light in the dark place of his own making he could feel rocks relax alive beside him gather from a moon-raveled river the pearl curves and blue fluency of a girl his hands once knew he could let her go he let it all go desire and grief and raw need going out of him moment by moment into the mild immaculate night love by love into a last passion of pure attention nerves readiness ... light carved out of the darkness a muscled trunk each clenched limb and the difficult tips of a plain mesquite taking shape over the hard ground where they found him his eyes wide and his whole body hungering upward as if he could hear and bear the bird singing unseen deep in those leaves

i stood inside myself like a dead tree or a tower i pulled the rope of braided hair and high above me a bell of leaves tolled because my hand stabbed its brother i said make it stone because my tongue spoke harshly i said make it dust and yet it was not death but her body in its green dress i longed for that ’ s why i stood for days in the field until the grass turned black and the rain came

for d ’ andra my bowl brimming with pretzels the snack you wanted least i slid open the door of our sleeping car where we had been enjoying the country rushing by as if we were the first two people to look down into the valleys and see bright necks of pines stretch across farms and streams to the groves they once cradled you had asked for earl grey cookies sandwiched around buttercream or marshmallows made of chocolate but all the tea bags had been dunked and the chocolate melted over biscotti when i came bearing the salted and twisted news the room was empty but for a heel it was black as a bunting and wound with zippers and every time the car rocked it looked ready to fly and escape into the cold tangled air of travel that always feels heavy with joy and desire and a little sadness always a little sadness because of the leaving which is what i do when i realize i ’ m in the wrong room and that numbers have betrayed me again while i was hunting and gathering foraging like homo habilis who probably never lost his cave out of patience i opened every door marked with threes and eights those conjoined twins disastrously separated at birth and roused the scabbed eyes of sleepers like a beggar no an angel a begging angel who has written on his heart will work for love having not found our room not heard the sharp swing of your voice i descended upon the passenger cars and row upon row of couples asleep or staring out the windows like zombies trying to remember what happens next once the newspaper is well-thumbed the tea has gone cold and the conversation is dead i called for you in vain even using your secret names the ones only the night knows wind-kiss brilliant-fruit dervish-moon over and over i said your names over and over until they filled the wounded air of the car and when there was no more room for another sound they caught and hooked the ring of the brakes hugging the rails just when i thought i wouldn ’ t find you you were there the train was pulling away and i was watching you slowly eat a dish of whipped cream and bananas — the house special — in a cafe in a city we didn ’ t know when you finished we started walking down a road that bent like a smile a shy smile like the one the japanese cat wore on your purse the road we were told would take us to the end of the line where all lovers in search of joy packed on bullet trains — they ’ re the fastest on two continents — arrive every hour
to mary — — 1. so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own heart 's home as to his queen some victor knight of faëry earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light 2. the toil which stole from thee so many an hour is ended —and the fruit is at thy feet no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet water-falls leap among wild islands green which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss-grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been 3. thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass i do remember well the hour which burst my spirit 's sleep a fresh may-dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near school-room voices that alas were but one echo from a world of woes— the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes 4. and then i clasped my hands and looked around— —but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground— so without shame i spake — '' i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check '' i then controuled my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold 5. and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined 6. alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one — such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone — yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clog until revived by thee 7. thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long 8. no more alone through the world 's wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went.— there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood 9. now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power which says —let scorn be not repaid with scorn and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath life 's beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me the parents of the song i consecrate to thee 10. is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence ne'er to sound again though it might shake the anarch custom 's reign and charm the minds of men to truth 's own sway holier than was amphion 's i would fain reply in hope—but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey 11. and what art thou i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally 12. they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth of glorious parents thou aspiring child i wonder not—for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name 13. one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desart hears the music of his home —unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low-thoughted cares like thunder-stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling-place 14. truth 's deathless voice pauses among mankind if there must be no response to my cry— if men must rise and stamp with fury blind on his pure name who loves them —thou and i sweet friend can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the world 's tempestuous night — two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seaman 's sight that burn from year to year with unextinguished light
the unthinkable prospect of a world in which i am left to my own devices which are few and as soon as the batteries die useless first order of business i draw a map in the sand mark where i stand as the capital of civilization within me the detailed blueprints of the pyramids and the concept of zero beyond me the finite frontier the many miles of undeveloped shoreline with spectacular views of a sea filled with intricately depicted monsters i have a lot to do before i introduce the new world to art and astronomy and industry medicine and technology ethics politics democracy by a show of hands we shall elect which tree to burn in the first fire
again this morning my eyes woke up too close to your eyes their almost green orbs too heavy-lidded to really look back to wake up next to you is ordinary i do not even need to look at you to see you but i do look so when you come to me in your opulent sadness i see you do not want me to unbutton you so i can not do the one thing i can do now it is almost one a.m. i am still at my desk and you are upstairs at your desk a staircase away from me already it is years of you a staircase away from me to be near you and not near you is ordinary you are ordinary still how many afternoons have i spent peeling blue paint from our porch steps peering above hedgerows the few parked cars for the first glimpse of you how many hours under the overgrown pink camillas thinking the color was wrong for you thinking you 'd appear after my next blink soon you 'll come down the stairs to tell me something and i 'll say okay okay i 'll say it like that say it just like that i 'll go on being your never-enough it 's not the best in you i long for it 's when you 're noteless numb at the ends of my fingers all is all i say it is
the sculptures in this gallery have been carefully treated with a protective wax so that visitors may touch them —exhibitions the art institute of chicago stone soldier it 's okay now i 've removed my rings my watch my bracelets i 'm allowed brave girl to touch you here where the mail covers your throat your full neck down your shoulders to here where raised unlatchable buckles mock-fasten your plated armor nothing peels from you your skin gleams like the silver earrings you do not wear above you museum windows gleam october above you high gold leaves flinch in the garden but the flat immovable leaves entwined in your hair to crown you go through what my fingers ca n't i want you to have a mind i can turn in my hands you have a smooth and upturned chin cold cheeks unbruisable eyes and hair as grooved as fig skin it 's october but it 's not october behind your ears which do n't hint of dark birds moving overhead or of the blush and canary leaves emptying themselves in slow spasms into shallow hedgerows still bride of your own armor bride of your own blind eyes this is n't an appeal if i could i would let your hair down and make your ears disappear your head at my shoulder my fingers on your lips— as if the cool of your stone curls were the cool of an evening— as if you were about to eat salt from my hand
just for this evening let 's not mock them not their curtsies or cross-garters or ever-recurring pepper trees in their gardens promising promising at least they had ideas about love all day we 've driven past cornfields past cows poking their heads through metal contraptions to eat we 've followed west 84 and what else irrigation sprinklers fly past us huge wooden spools in the fields lounging sheep telephone wires yellowing flowering shrubs before us above us the clouds swell layers of them the violet underneath of clouds every idea i have is nostalgia look up there is the sky that passenger pigeons darkened and filled— darkened for days eclipsing sun eclipsing all other sound with the thunder of their wings after a while it must have seemed that they followed not instinct or pattern but only one another when they stopped audubon observed they broke the limbs of stout trees by the weight of the numbers and when we stop we 'll follow—what our hearts the puritans thought that we are granted the ability to love only through miracle but the troubadours knew how to burn themselves through how to make themselves shrines to their own longing the spectacular was never behind them think of days of those scarlet-breasted blue-winged birds above you think of me in the garden humming quietly to myself in my blue dress a blue darker than the sky above us a blue dark enough for storms though cloudless at what point is something gone completely the last of the sunlight is disappearing even as it swells— just for this evening wo n't you put me before you until i 'm far enough away you can believe in me then try try to come closer— my wonderful and less than

this guy i know a rabbi friday nights on his way home before sunset in winter always stops at a florist or bodega and buys a bunch of flowers for his wife every week the same a ritual regardless of her mood that morning fresh upsets at work or snarling on the bridge he brings her roses wrapped in cellophane but isn ’ t there a ring of hokiness in that why should a good man have to show his devotion some things go unspoken some things get tested on the real world and isn ’ t that the place that matters most so when you told me i should bring you flowers i joked “ but don ’ t i show my feelings more in dog walks diapers and rewiring lamps ” the flowers i learned later weren ’ t for wooing not for affection in long marriage but for something seeded even deeper down through frost heaves and which might be roughly peace it ’ s funny that i just assumed romance now there ’ s no peace with us i wonder what they might have meant to you those simple tokens holding in sight what no rite can grow back

mama said it only existed in storybooks with its soft surface of bluebells but there it was spinning so close to the earth that it bent every weather vane in omaha it was prom night and i thought i ’ d pluck a few trumpets to bring your grandma so i pulled our red ladder out of the garage and climbed to the roof i stood up and imagined i was balancing the moon on my head the narrow windows of union station gleamed like ice chips and the thin faces of the clock tower told me it was almost eight i was going to be late picking nancy up if i didn ’ t get a move on so i snipped off the best stems and hurried back down to my ford i sped through every stop sign on my way to her parents ’ house she was waiting with her arms crossed trying not to look upset i think she thought she was going to get stood up so when i popped open the door and told her to get in she couldn ’ t help smiling a bit she asked what ’ d taken me so long and i figured i should go ahead and give her the flowers i ’ d brought her i ’ d set them back behind the steering wheel to not ruin the surprise i told her she was the princess and i was the knight who rode into the stars so he could flare their notes to her on a blue horn
for rebecca you are the kind of person who buys exotic fruits leaves them out on the counter until they rot you always mean to eat them sometimes you rearrange them rousing over the bowl a cloud of tiny flies how do they balance the parrot who chews a walnut sideways holding it up in his right foot the owl perched on a just-lit lamppost scratching behind its ear like a big dog your pencil eraser wears down long before the point for every word you write you rub out two where the slice of toast rested the plate is still warm a film of fog little points of dew love is like velocity we feel the speeding up and the slowing down otherwise not at all the more steady the more it feels like going nowhere my love i want to go nowhere with you i can not bring myself to toss the cup of cold coffee you set down by the door on your way to the taxi all day i have sipped it each time forgetting your two tablets of fake sugar too sweet running down the street dodging between raindrops plump as cherries the ground was feathered with wild strawberries i picked seven as many as i could bear i ate two i saved the rest for you here hold out your hand take them taste how sweet please hold me the forgotten way the wall pleads spray-paint face and voice of a damned poet the darling damned poets save them from themselves maybe it is us they need saving from
when my lover became my enemy i made my bed amongst winds and drove the old road ’ till my heart crashed where ’ s the bypass washing my shirts wringing them out hung in the breeze water skips undressed over outcrops what it says is wind roots in rock lying on long tongue sun diffused in mist easy sleep without waking edge of displaced echoes air around and sound of bird and ’ plane a swallow ’ s glittering chitter
i left my heart in the teeth of jumper-cables— black tongue superfluous nipples by the time i hit the yellow tape— it was already turning red of my fair and alabaster love my redundant chains drawn in chalk halfway to the stars i stopped— turned spat—it ’ s too late baby
some things lock in competition like an earthquake and a kiss while a decision is waiting to be made neither side of the argument progresses the earthquake though eager to prove its claim shows valiant restraint the kiss it knows the power of bitten tongues such stand-offs as these precede most gains stance of knowing too much and fearing too late the tongues shaking along with the house say nothing shattering at all with progress not only earthquakes but kisses will be predicted the last fine line between feeling and fact will choose a good point and end flattery will continue to make us immortal in the difficult years between the first word and the lost in which mary herself a palette of grays inhabitant of a universe void of color gains access to the complete scientific story of what makes red red—and reads it
we meet midway to walk white cobbles under a fish-flesh gray sky europe is collapsing we are collapsing always and again no matter how hard we love one another i don ’ t understand our failure where the feed loops back and spits us into another country another junior suite reenacting this same same beat of a scene that begins rises never ends always ends — our intentions don ’ t meet their courses set differently by a force you don ’ t believe in could be as simple as life i want to be the wife you don ’ t want you won ’ t let go of my wrist i resist threaten bully acquiesce we write the next act of the alchemist in new york lisbon a beach a bar star-crossed maybe from different galaxies you approach i retreat you retreat i reproach the manic two-step jitters over north africa ’ s dunes farther than our hero santiago can see i rise in the night to find the sharp knife that came with the pears as a courtesy
not seeing me not even looking k. on her silver cruiser charms her way through the last long moment of the changing light snow boots and a seychelles warbler ’ s old blue tights a rolled-up yoga mat in her basket wobbling like a wild tiller as she pedals it feels illicit and somewhat right to stand across the intersection without shouting her name or even waving according to the internet tutorial the fact that photons turn into tiny loyal billiard balls as soon as we start watching suggests no error of method or measurement but rather as far as anyone can tell an invisibly unstable world a shaking everywhere that seeing must pin down and fix so that morning i stumbled on you out alone bending through the traffic at orange and edwards streets a someone else then whom i alone can never otherwise see — there has to be a kind of speech beyond naming or even praise a discipline that locates light and lets it go
when you said no i went for your dresser opened the top drawer broke the paper seals on the two sterile cups and wiped my dirty thumbs inside because our stubborn love won ’ t die i have to kill it will it dead or so i thought until i passed a cycle on my own you ’ ve no idea what ’ s grown inside me since i bled
my transgressions pile against the garden wall built when rome began to weaken scarred by a cannonball i gossiped i snubbed a dinner guest i watch until the wall writhes with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows and the odd librarian i ’ ve begun to be depleted by your absence one of love ’ s worst symptoms for years i ’ d had the sense to hold myself apart i ’ ve been here long enough to kill two mint plants and a lavender then resurrect their better part i ’ d like to let you die on the vine not you the you i dream who follows through on waking see how the watcher sees the storm but doesn ’ t get wet be that be what be wiser than the heart

in my seeing there was a blank and he filled that blank with words there were words for darkness which made it lift there were words for cover which ripped them off there were legs that crossed and hearts that crossed promises red and read and the pluck of banjo had a name for that twang and the way he called the world into notice that had a word too once i saw i couldn ’ t unsee and the worst was that the light glaring from the letters left blue haze under my eyelids there are no photographs of this time and i can only go by what others tell me i was blurred and erratic i drew a circle of white chalk around me and called myself inviolate i watched for horses on the horizon my walls were under siege from smaller men who called themselves heroes they say i reached over the balustrade and picked up the tiny ships and threw them over the edge of the world i tore my hair cut one breast from my body and plattered it as around my fortifications one man pulled another man behind his chariot if they say that ’ s how i was that ’ s how i was i have no words for the one in the mirror who apes me every morning she ’ s not the one i remember imagining as a young girl there must be a way to unsee how i tap the glass and she taps back and which wall which cassandra weeping—everything i saw i spoke to his ear and the wall crashed into place between us the horse had a bellyful of it the blank was full of small soldiers and he turned from my beauty and said my name
i ’ m having trouble understanding the wife the wife seems like she is only there as a foil to your actions i want to know how the wife feels when you drag her and your son down into the basement to start a new religion the religion has something to do with cowering before a force greater than yourself and then being buried alive i want to know how the wife behaves in small enclosed spaces if she is trying to comfort your son by telling him daddy likes to play funny games or if she is already visualizing herself walking into a women ’ s shelter your son on her back and maybe because this is a fantasy she carries a burning torch like an angry villager or a goddess does the wife merit any revenge after you weed whack the coffee table does she agree with you that the coffee table is yours to destroy because you built it what has she built in the house that is hers to destroy what kind of childhood has the wife endured that allows her to understand you in her past life or lives was the wife ever a shepherdess does she see you as a sort of pan goatish and pricked by ticks but also very well-endowed when the wife transforms into a tree can she still think or is she just a green haze inside an idea of growing i would like to see the wife peel off that bark leaving only enough for modesty ’ s sake although as this is your poem we can take a bit more off i want to see her uproot herself pick up the house and shake it how many people fall out the wife has something about her the germans would call unheimlich i sometimes catch a glimpse of the wife out of the corner of my eye but then i look away i can not look directly at the wife the wife is a conflagration of everything dear i wonder sometimes if she is faking there is a certain note she holds too long so the orgasm is more operatic less genuine when she cries oh my god really she should stutter let ’ s say the wife wakes up in the morning you have already made breakfast does your kindness feel oppressive does she want to take your weed whacker through the house has she ever in a fit of anger destroyed your pornography when you found a picture of the wife online with a foreign handprint smacked red on her ass how quickly did your shock turn to arousal are you aware the wife is breaking down in public places and sometimes can not move for thirty minutes sometimes her arm goes entirely numb from the shoulder down i think the wife might need some fine-tuning some elbow grease some wrenching apart and then reassembling
they call it sacrifice— imagine me a tiny poppy on a field of green felt—brief blip of color limitless expanse i ’ ve never felt foreign or like a lash in his eye if it ’ s not love it ’ s very like most days it feels the same— exacting—he tweezes the stray thoughts from my speech cleans up my heart with a tortoiseshell comb every lady should have such a man edging her lawn with a sharp rotary blade year by year—let ’ s call it always— editor and editrix engaged against a flurry of typos showered in revisionist white out i erase his crow ’ s feet buff away his frown my head—he yawns it open scoops out dark foam yesses i ’ ve regretted the tiny poppy everyone sees flapping to pieces— and so we are growing taller sweeter ratified in the glow of the big correction
they were not traditionalists they could bear the innovations of plot they could not wait to landscape the plot they had plans for a bed of pansies because pansies hardly ever die in a cold snap because pansies are hardy despite the name when they shoved the trowel into the soil it was with his hand on the handle and hers adding force they knew there were only nine types of people in the world and they knew which ones would close the deal they knew the shirkers by sight they had options they knew about required communication about how i feel and you feel when there was a question of who did the dishes and who did the cat box it was settled in-house and never required an outside contractor but the pansies got stem spot leaf rot and mildew when they looked at their options it seemed there weren ’ t really that many after all they swore to uphold the bonds and the principles and the yelling they swore to oral sex they dressed to the nines and they walked the aisle they stood up and received the standard narration

what represses unhomes in the sound who has made me what is made me is a voice just muscles and shape and breath to phrase a song boats assemble at the mouth of the harbor mouth in earth you who wrote an ode to silence never wrote of what is silenced i did seek all resounding caves let the voice be lit all the lanterns in the new world we need the language of stone from string to string quiver in the opening the garden so beautiful lucifer dark sun of morning no eden but innocence no expulsion but after • no more will i listen to other than a single note moaned not known i do not here think again what place presents itself own moan well eye here body as a battery of the one moment when it is time to open your mouth to plug in i will allow what i invented to find its color make a shape

often called g-d • vantablack was made for missiles or planes for defense purposes so dark no eye could see it some voices are like that no one could hear them it is not good to be lost to be lost is more than metaphor for spiritual condition i sit at the terrace overlooking the green sea perhaps it is failure that ought to be sought the voice that fails falls silent sheila ’ s or the body ’ s the blue failed me the sun fails every evening i we you have all failed too everyone who strove all these long years for peace failed • august 7 predawn blue and blue the sound of the sea further away and less violent lights on the water fishing boats closer than i imagined no one is awake some animals maybe what i do without knowing in a harrowing world what i do without knowing as i listen to the gurgle of water against the promontory i feel like i am listening to a body how slow and opening a piece of tune where one does not know how it will unfold no chord or cadence to tell you in sound what the path will be how it will happen until it happens i do not want to be alone what does it mean anyway when someone says “ muslim ” • can she still feel music in her body can she vocalize even without technology of the mouth tongue palate glottis vocal chords what is a voice anish kapoor granted exclusive right to work with blackest black she now communicates through notes and gesture

words too have god inside but for the prize of the body they do not compete can not hold the storm of time can not hold the line do i touch the ocean inside will my family come to my funeral • that night we swam the full moon civilized us federated us gave us our nationality we who were lost i have now lost what little heritage i did have returned to the rude rough world long vowels of morning evening birds scream no soft blanket falling to cover but a throttling a suffocation of dusk no silence when the self stills the absence of noise is itself torture i can not sleep tongued loose drones move through a riff by a singer without papers • august 9 eleanna takes me out on the water miller exploding the form of the novel itself i see now how nin wanted to move away from his vociferous singing of the world as material to try to construct a music of the way the mind works still fed by light on the water a mute noise of engines under water as the boat passes the light house and heads out for open sea remembering in palestine crawling down the hill trying to catch a wifi signal from the settlement untapped improvisation of space • at the stone terrace the gardener lingers clipping hedges while i work breeze between us soon i will return i read the article about a poet who was killed in the street his poems untranslated all the artists and writers killed the open space of the sea yesterday eleanna and i went too far out went almost all the way to marseille we saw the pink-gray sky of wildfire i accepted the waves i found in the chapters of the quran to sing my way through turbulence draw a way through the waves savage wildfire all the villages evacuated • we woke to the smell of burning air a little cool smell of charred refuse colors muted last night the moon came clear nearly blue eyes too painfully large rough on the eyes and impatient but i wanted to look so badly for the meteors the sea crashing against the rocks smoke from the fire obscured the sky in the morning we rowed across the harbor and realized fear of heights and fear of depth is the same just one you see and one you don ’ t
a boy i did not marry taught me to dance salsa on 2 placed the fingers of his left hand on my untutored spine you know what it ’ s like to become someone ’ s clave to love for the span of the trombone ’ s long breath he whispered negra so i spun my heart landing on the rum-covered linoleum of a nightclub on what used to be new york ave in what used to be chocolate city i let him turn spin my name bella negra his hands were less tender but still i let them roam when i 1 2 3 5 6 7 in front of my mirror i was always la negra defended in the lyric and you can forgive searching hands when a mouth swells the biggest ache of your body into song
when my wife was breaking apart my son was falling in love she lay on the couch with a heated sack of rice on her belly sometimes dozing sometimes staring out the window at the olive tree as it broke into tiny white blossoms as it swelled into bitter black fruit at first i wanted to spare him i wished he was still farming up north tucking bulbs of green onions into their beds and watering the lettuce his hands gritty his head haloed in a straw hat but as the months deepened i grew selfish i wanted him here with his new love when i passed the open bathroom door i wanted to see them brushing their teeth one perched on the toilet lid one on the side of the tub laughing and talking through their foamy mouths toothbrushes rattling against their teeth like sage gives its scent when you crush it like stone is hard they were happy and i could touch it
and although i am a poet i am not the bullet i will not heat-search the soft points i am not the coroner who will graze her hand over naked knees who will swish her fingers in the mouth who will flip the body over her eye a hook fishing for government-issued lead i am not the sidewalk which is unsurprised as another cheek scrapes harsh against it although i too enjoy soft palms on me enjoy when he rests on my body with a hard breath i have clasped this man inside me and released him again and again listening to him die thousands of little deaths what is a good metaphor for a woman who loves in a time like this i am no scalpel or high thread count sheet not a gavel or hand-painted teacup i am neither nor romanced by the streetlamp nor candlelight my hands are not an iron but look they ’ re hot look how i place them in love on his skin and am still able to unwrinkle his spine
when you finally after deep illness lay the length of your body on mine isn ’ t it like the strata of the earth the pressure of time on sand mud bits of shell all the years uncountable wakings sleepings sleepless nights fights ordinary mornings talking about nothing and the brief fiery plummets and the unselfconscious silences of animals grazing the moving water wind ice that carries the minutes leaves behind minerals that bind the sediment into rock how to bear the weight with every flake of bone pressed in then how to bear when the weight is gone the way a woman whose neck has been coiled with brass can no longer hold it up alone oh love it is balm but also a seal it binds us tight as the fur of a rabbit to the rabbit when you strip it grasping the edge of the sliced skin pulling the glossy membranes apart the body is warm and limp if you could you ’ d climb inside that wet slick skin and carry it on your back this is not neat and white and lacy like a wedding not the bright effervescence of champagne spilling over the throat of the bottle this visceral bloody union that is love but beyond love beyond charm and delight the way you to yourself are past charm and delight this is the shucked meat of love the alleys and broken glass of love the petals torn off the branches of love the dizzy hoarse cry the stubborn hunger
why not a crocus from this bulb why not the purple of bees ’ lust so that in honey she might taste something good under skin purple is a private taste closer to the blood of her tongue closer to the blood she chokes on when she ’ s gasping to the clot behind her blackened eye the heated force that slammed her shin that pushed bone from the bone that arched her but did not approach caress is another kind of lust spring a madness of grappling isn ’ t that what she sees outside every window and inside nothing unique going on
it ’ s september i ’ ve moved into town into the attic of an old barn—a big open room i reach by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor the room is long and high with windows at each end a row of skylights that leak rain and shake and chatter in the northeast winds i sleep beneath the roof ’ s steep pitch my mattress flat on the boards looking up at the high ceiling where morning diffuses downward in grains of bright dust this was the old painter ’ s studio the light in those famous canvases is still here —he couldn ’ t carry it away with him— though his paintings took away everything else opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow i think of his violent loves the stories they still tell about him here but how quiet and alive his paintings were how they quiver with the life not yet realized the town is quiet in september sometimes i hear people talking in the street last night someone said they were going to wait for michael and a voice said that michael had gone home i walk the narrow path down to the marsh wind hard in the dunes rain as i ’ m returning cutting through twisting streets past gardens bent low with rain their colors a wash of gold i feel the air surround my body feel it move between my legs and between each finger as i walk not mastering space but in it and when the clouds open the sky suddenly wide and high no roof of leaves it seems there ’ s nowhere to go but into wind or water i climb the narrow stairs that keep turning twisting inward until they meet the ceiling which opens and i rise through the floor released into an openness i never learn to expect at the yellow table i sit and read an interview with picasso ’ s lover francoise gilot the only one to leave him and have another life she says she was not destroyed by him as the others were “ because i am of the stuff that can not be destroyed. ” i felt something blow through me then some devouring wind surely then i am of the stuff that can be destroyed haven ’ t i felt it the breaking of all i was don ’ t i sit and count my losses here in this room where all the life i knew has ended so bare with desire i seem to be eating sky that ’ s how it is here i ’ m lonely sad the wind blows along the roof and i can ’ t sleep rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor leaving dirty puddles on the boards a yellow table and a cupboard painted blue three chairs that do n't match or even balance rightly a dented bucket its metal reflecting darkly what is what can not be taken away what ’ s beautiful here the whole thing is beauty a clarity not in things but around them complete and still i seem to remain somehow myself to remain at least something at a loss to know how much can be taken from me and leave me only changed not ruined alert in an emptiness so alive i recognized it as my life what would be left the shape of it then this life i said some beauty or radiance an endless space i fall into or am taken up by a brightness that holds me gathers light in the center of empty space like a vision of the life i have not lived

she was pretty swacked by the time she put the spaghetti meatballs into the orgy pasta bowl—there was mixed salt pepper in the “ tittie-tweak ” pasta bowl—we drank some dago red from glazed girlie demi-tasse cups—after which we engaged in heterosexual intercourse mutual masturbation fellatio cunnilingus for dessert we stared at a cupboard full of art critic friends sgraffitoed into underglazes on vases we did have a very nice time
we remember the rabbit when we see the duck but we can not experience both at the same time —e.h gombrich art and illusion what do you remember when i looked at his streaky glasses i wanted to leave him and before that he stole those cherries for me at midnight we were walking in the rain and i loved him and before that i saw him coming toward me that time at the picnic edgy foreign but you loved him he sat in his room with the shades drawn brooding but you loved him he gave me a photo of himself at sixteen diving from the pier it was summer his arms outstretched and before that his mother was combing his soft curls with her fingers and crying crying is that what he said he put on the straw hat and raced me to the barn what did he tell you here ’ s the dried rose brown as tobacco here ’ s the letter that i tore and pasted the book of blank pages with the velvet cover but do you still love him when i rub the nap backwards the colors lift bristle what do you mean sometimes when i ’ m all alone i find myself stroking it
at first you didn ’ t know me i was a shape moving rapidly nervous at the edge of your vision a flat high voice dark slash of hair across my cheekbone i made myself present though never distinct things i said that he repeated a tone you could hear but never trace in his voice silence—followed by talk of other things when you would sit at your desk i would creep near you like a question a thought would scurry across the front of your mind i ’ d be there ducking out of sight you must have felt me watching you my small eyes fixed on your face the smile you wondered at on the lips only the voice on the phone quick and full of business all that you saw and heard and could not find the center of those days growing into years growing inside of you out of reach now with you forever in your house in your garden in corridors of dream where i finally tell you my name

you have a beautiful mouth luigi the man-boy says the rubber raft has floated far from shore the choice is this medusa sea a boil of jellied lashes or face the kiss
turning to watch you leave i see we must always walk toward other loves river of heaven between two office buildings orphaned cloud fish soup poppling book spined in the open palm unstoppable light i think it is all right or do tonight garden toad a speaking stone young sound in an old heart annul the self i float it a day lily in my wine oblivion i love our lives keeping me from it
do i still long for my virginity — fragment 107 i never longed for my virginity i heard it on the radio after the hurricane there in the aftermath was the voice of a man — once the sweet screwed-up boy whose hooded jessed spirit i tried to possess with the ruthlessness i mistook for power here he was on npr so gentle so familiar with devastation his timbre woke the teenage falconer in me who once saw his kindness as weakness saw a boy as an unfledged goshawk — a creature to trap and be trapped with in darkened mews i knew the rules neither of us could sleep until the molting bird grew ravenous enough to take the raw mouse from my hand breaking the falcon broke us both left us scared and less aware of love than fear
when this day returns to me i will value your heart long hurt in long division over mine mouth above mine too — say you love me truth never more meant say you are angry words words we net with our mouths soul is an old thirst but not as first as the body ’ s perhaps though on bad nights its melancholy eats us out to a person true time is undigressing yet true is all we can be rhyming you rhyming me
what is mysterious about loss flush of arm pulled from a wilted sleeve summer ’ s urine-tang in autumn leaves let john keats light another fag or brontë refuse the doctor on her black sateen settee for whatever part of you may be taken away you said is the scar i will visit first with my mouth each time as gold visits the thieved till sun the obliterated sill saying praise you for leaving me this you this living still
i have tried to say that although love is not judgement analysis too is a style of affect since the scale that rends me vulnerable has cut from abundance doubt not that identity shunts civic ratio or consequence sure — i would prefer to respond to only the established charms and forget inconvenience but her hair was also a kind of honey or instrument all that is beautiful from which i choose even artifice which i hold above nature won ’ t salve these stuttered accoutrements
what is this tint that in the shrill cress will never cease to trouble us and in the fields gives prick and praise for beauty and said birds that feed on berries are pervious—and shook the snow from his thighs i thought of nothing carefully but of snow and the birds then kissed the cup and sipped a little though almost choked drank slowly tickled with strange measure she faked a pretty anger i entertained the night with fantastic empty pleasure we went as far as the ivie-bush and ivie-crowns upon our heads and carried her kiss untouched and entire then all was fresh inclined to wriggle and nussle and lascivious ardent leaps in the thickest of the wood bid him kiss close and often and directed him to her fancie the ground had a sweeter scent the boughs a blush one fruit rare and rich would outdo many together she was wild to climb the tree nor would she be forbidden she seized the apple and put it in her bosom

someone once told me that animals are people under spells and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted i recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan i watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours watched her peck bugs from her breast i was sure she would make a beautiful bride but she was always a black trumpeter swan i once brushed a horse ’ s hair for 3 straight years until it crumpled into death the truth is there is no such thing as spells the world is always as it is and always as it seems and love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood
there are trees and they are on fire there are hummingbirds and they are on fire there are graves and they are on fire and the things coming out of the graves are on fire the house you grew up in is on fire there is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire there is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire there is a wooden cage we ’ re trapped in too large to see and it is on fire there are jaguars on fire wolves spiders wolf-spiders on fire if there were people if our fathers were alive if we had a daughter fire to the edges fire in the river beds fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in fire in your mother ’ s belly there is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb there is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse there is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair there is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur there are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us pooling around us forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud there is this feeling i get when i am with you there is our future house burning like a star on the hill there is our dark flickering shadow there is my hand on fire in your hand on fire my body on fire above your body on fire our tongues made of ash we are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet we have our whole life ahead of us

the belt kicks on with a whir the whir licks the end grain of the offcut with a hint of hesitation a small wind of ochre dust sweeps off the belt before the belt comes back to where it was the whole room swells with the scent of cinnamon desire how imprecise the smell of desire the wood takes on a sheen a gloss the grain can live behind without worry of being forgotten a single knot blinks out of the small block and becomes the eye of a hummingbird its beak bending around the edge of the wood its small song captured in the annular rings to think this block was tossed in with the scraps that the bird could have been lost or burned

“ so why don ’ t you sleep with girls ” “ i ’ m not really attracted to girls. ” “ are you telling me you were really attracted to every man you slept with ” conversation with a friend 1. after twenty i stopped counting not like my friend beverly who sewed an embroidered satin star on her bell-bottoms for every new guy she fucked she had them running down both legs and around the billowing hem and was starting up the inseam when the jeans gave out in the wash. it was a boys ’ game anyway those years of our extended homage to the penis the guitar playing the penis drums saluting it cock rock molotov cocktail the motorcycle gripped between the thighs and i went down we all went down in the old cultural disaster of idol worship—a thousand-year bender only this time it was the adolescent member oiled and laved thrust forward arcing thin with ache all tight flesh poked upward claiming its own how it came and went penetrating but never settling down and how often we were caused to admire it hairless sweet warrior raider against the state but i have this sweet pink flower here between my legs—i put my hand down and touch it still soft and wet and many-folded endlessly opening hiding seeking hidden and sought but never very much admired or even smiled on in those years never served much less sung to not a garden then but a citadel a wall to be breached a new land claimed but linger there no i would say there was an overall lack of appreciation though breasts were well respected slopping loose under t-shirts like little animals and i would feel my nipples brush the cotton with pleasure see them regarded also with pleasure still sex then was a taking like spoils of war a victory over all those straight fucks back home marooned in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways and god knows it felt good those nights i was ready it was ready to open and answer the call and take me down and roll me over yes and give it to me—but why all this riding away afterward where was everyone going and why didn ’ t i get to ride along who knew at first nothing had changed just wanting the thrust and tug and slam up against the headboard i should say so but left still wanting more wanting to leap out of centuries ’ shame and be something new not this old consolation of women for the powerless some kind of cosmic door prize awarded just for showing up with a dick some proof to themselves these boys were men “ you ’ re good ” he said hell i wasn ’ t taking a typing test i was fighting to live in a dying world i was throwing myself away an offering to wildest space surrender to the mind ’ s dissolve the body ’ s electric light nerve endings firing like exploding stars “ you ’ re good ” they all said you ’ d think somebody was doing a survey girls say yes to boys who say no and then your professor asks if you ’ re wearing underwear when you meet for your conference on the poetry of yeats crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car after a visit to the after-hours doctor ’ s office in sarnia nodding out in the back seat pills wearing off he was a legend among undergraduates cheap and reliable always on call until a month later the headlines screamed “ abortion doc ” when a girl died in his office and he dragged her down to the river and dumped her body in the underbrush

when the strong drag of the boy ’ s adolescence pulls through them the family rises into thinness and begins to break like a wave you turned away when i kissed you the woman says why half-lidded days of early winter when he points toward the woman the boy looks at his hand the way dogs will the boy ’ s jaw sets as though behind his teeth into the soft flesh of his throat a new set of teeth were cutting through a mouth for what each of them adopts a private view arguments veer every which way and who can follow a sequence of dark non sequiturs blows in when one when one word when the word suicide enters the room where they are shouting the system closes down prematurely becalmed the man writes i am not given a subject but am given to my subject i am inside it like a parasite he sees the woman ’ s face contract at the approach of other futures than the one for which her face was prepared so they inhabit their bodies like music for a given time and yet he continues to act as if there were times to come i just want you to go away one of them screams expressionless and flat as a tortilla the afternoon moon over their house she calls the man to a corner in the basement those aren ’ t spider eggs he says backing up those are its eyes when the encounter with the self is volcanic nothing can follow tearing open the cocoon to reveal itself a boy within the family as if they were waiting as if inside experience bright with meaning there were another experience pendant unnameable

1 the woman stands on tiptoe to kiss the man and for a moment with their twin-teal backpacks parkas and other gear— they look like one new creature a mutation 2 seated in la rosita their gear guards the table where they sip cafe con leche and lean forward sitting tall pelvises tilted forward to talk—whisper —their physical closeness almost embarrassing but to whom at this early hour— light rivering in her chestnut hair their foreheads almost touching as they sit further forward straddling their chairs toes pressed down heels up wrists crossed a posture almost too intimate for a public space at breakfast but somehow right in the spanish café she says that while it is absurd to sell forsythia it is a small miracle to buy cactus on 107th street and broadway if they ’ re strangers in manhattan they seem more at home than i ’ ve ever been they listen to the brisk chatter and clatter of plates and music from the spanish station which now plays “ yellow submarine ” — universal language — “ our friends are all aboard. ” they study the menu and note the beautiful sounds words like huevos and arroz make for eggs and rice the generous syllabic count and vowel length seem like an echo for their love and their desire to linger other eyes are on them not only mine they have drawn the morning from a sea of newsprint—in at least three languages—toward their window seat 3 the light changes along with the brisk pace of the walkers someone in a tan mackintosh reaches out to hail a yellow cab while the sun gilds the fire escapes and people rise energetically from their beds 4 don ’ t their eyes tire of each other or is it not the eyes that tire they ’ re not looking they ’ re drinking communicating through their skin several inches apart love can ’ t be trusted but that doesn ’ t mean it isn ’ t real they linger over coffee he strokes the back of her neck she doesn ’ t feel impelled to look up or stop but later she kisses him behind the ear 5 and in the mountains there is snow melting to get down from the heights to pour through the clefts in the twisted rocks natural arches obstacles—horseshoe shapes and in the plains there is a dropping of the shoulder-armor a tingling in the hip sockets so that even a chance touch at the hipbone startles the center and starts a slow convulsion— release of two creatures peculiarly perilously at odds used to training their gaze on the peripheries like this bicycle tethered to a parking meter orange handlebars silver trunk like a treasure chest perched—not locked—on a wrought iron ledge fixed over the chrome wheel-casings— blue shadow-dappled twig-littered canopies or the small tantalizing cursive c in the blue neon soft as silk announcing café equense where the couple might return in the voluptuous dark the dark quietly vibrating like a mouth harp or her—noiseless—breathing…or when they are lost in olmsted ’ s misty labyrinthine rambles and framed by traffic they pause beside the lake in the dank air where the water is still another world from the blood-running pavement the meat-packing plants gray and dour below the rotting piers— warped— and will they be replaced with fresh wood or fazed out with poured concrete that knows no give or take—no—swelling—… what can love repair by what force of love can they imagine themselves beyond the squalor that surrounds them onto another plane blessed and blessing 6 who invented ecstasy what man or woman first walked around with its burden cold shelter from the street among the bronze mailboxes inside the bright red— freshly painted—door jambs he picks her up under the buttocks she arches her thighs around his hips plants her feet on the tiles tongues firm yet tentative learning their own momentum the rubbery wall of her mouth takes him further in and in tongue and tongue freckle and freckle tears shuddering swelling in the places where they used to ache “ ain ’ t no cure ” knowing this touch this grave flicking of tongues could never be repeated or knowing it could— knowing it in another consciousness 7 he strokes her neck at the junction where the occipital bone and cervical spine cross engage spark coccyx tingles cock rises toward her not into her through her to her rises as he plies the inside of her ass and thighs or rubs the crevice where her right forefinger and thumb divide stroking her cheek or the hollow below her earlobe ankle bone clavicle tonguing every millimeter until sea dissolves into sky their raft turns over in warm water and they are that water and bob afloat buoyant at rest in secret knowledge of each other ’ s darknesses… and now he could weep but there is no ice in the water where they would roil and tumble and where avenues welcome those who walk hand in hand gait easy backpacks half-full half empty— the sun coming out now as if synchronized to their desires— and as the runners circle the reservoir they lower their eyes to adjust to the light bouncing off the water to ignite the cinders the green through the dead- ice capped leaves a small curve an indent on the track gleams like a bracelet before an azure haze takes over 8 it gets warm she has to peel her anorak she cups her hand over her eyes in the light and wind off the reservoir to see the easy arcs the gulls make as they spiral upward over the all-angle roller coaster of the rooftops in the comforting thud of other feet as if lulled by the sound of a lover ’ s heartbeat danger in distraction she must kick the chain-link fence in order to set off again get back into the stream put her mind back into her body her body slender deceptive there is a power in it she has always known and feared or feared others would fear but it ’ s difficult with others always—just how to say it necessary to hold some one thing back whom could she trust to let it out it might scare her scare him 9 dawn a smudge of charcoal lifted by noon and his body as if heliotropic was drawn toward the flares of lilacs and now he knew to move cautiously keeping his eyes on the ground to not as he has done several times catch his foot on a stone or root cluster and fly off gashed 10 he ’ s relieved when night comes on he doesn ’ t need his eyes to know swallows congregate on the stark bare limbs the darkness grows through the darkness of that winter tree soon they will be one and no one will see them
14 in the wake riding north on the bus after hours in cars or in the air or airports or bus stations i felt almost happy for a moment as the tires hissed over the wet highway i was both in the rain and protected from it distracted from grief by the sensual pressure of the instant water beading on the glass the darkening hills but how glad i was to be riding north sunoco on one side mobil on the other his best friend was from mobile i always wanted to go there he died too soon or i left home i can ’ t remember two days ago my stepfather ’ s body was laid to rest comatose sucking air through a respirator i can ’ t say he was resting i saw him underground when i closed my eyes at night and went to bury the clock under mounds of towels and pillows—i had not heard it ticking so ferociously while he lived—and it would not quiet down and the rain tonight it ’ s not like any other and i wish the bus would go faster i saw the rain in the heavy hanging clouds that ’ s a lie immense factories blackening under a charcoal sky— and rivers whose names i ’ ll never remember i saw a sign reflected in my window milwaukee light whenever the chicago white sox beat the braves it made his day the braves were in milwaukee then with lefty warren spahn and slugger hank aaron the bus company is peter pan and the peter pan coffee shop was our first stop in chicago when we drove in and that ’ s where i was when though i didn ’ t know it then he married my mother in bermuda— watching peter pan in new york with my “ real ” father… and oh those prophetic lines not to grow up never to go to school never then to die only the living are immortal like these rain clouds the fact of death—a silence attends it an absence with which we ’ re all he was the lightest sleeper i ’ d ever known he ’ d open one eye if i merely peeked into his room intimate he ’ s there when i close my eyes but not when i reach out in the dark at his bedside i peeled back his eyelids rubbed his blue feet his bloated hands almost screamed in his ear wake up man i ’ ll be lonely without you i ’ ll be angry if you don ’ t wake up and in the silence of our nearness to death— the grinding hum of the generators working at their limit for too long to pump cool air in the killing heat the glug of him swallowing through the respirator at the bus station in springfield massachusetts the lateness of the bus angers a tough young woman from montana travelling with her toddler son and yet she knows the way i can see it in her green peaked cap her direct taut anger—bus late i kill the driver—boy knock over suitcase—i kill him too bus boarded the water bubbles on the windows break there is less and less outside to see… and he was not even my real father that should put a cap on it it ’ s like knowing the name of the lake you pass never seeing it again and yet finding it tough to forget that jagged square of black water just off the highway— that lake and not another baudelaire boasted that he laughed at funerals and wept at feasts now in the bus it ’ s only early evening i turn around and everyone ’ s sleeping— mother and son matron and magician half-awake i stare at the tree line and the blessing of rain and i would like to lie down on the roadside and drink and drink and roll in the mud mortifying one ’ s presence in the face of nature ’ s sanguine gaze green whitewashing the past whatever grooms the body for the afterlife pitches in this life like a tent in a night encampment before the dawn storming of the fortress the yellow day lilies wag their heads at the first touch of wind and i see what others have always seen in flowers a sign marked transients that keeps them awake see now as standing catatonic at the kitchen sink the overhead fluorescent light strip sinks into the pitch dark bottom of a coffee mug seeing is native to us and yet we stupefy our native sight not the eye ’ s sight some mourners hurl dirt stiffly on the coffin because it seems the right thing to do some hold back the flag-draped casket honors the first army chaplain in the pacific theater for praying good prayers above the bodies of the dead and of the living prelude to an afterword why should i feel compelled to write a thousand postscripts when i don ’ t work from life but to hear the testimonials of people who knew the rider the “ little rabbi ” moves me to tears while i am here to attend my mother who lies in bed with her stomach reaching toward the sky— where sam talks calmly to his “ grandpa in heaven ” matter-of-fact celestial discourse — and i listen to this baptist preacher and hospice worker as he crouches beside my chair in her hospital room talk about his work with mourning how difficult it is to get people to understand the element of surprise-over-time… how he kissed the little rabbi the first time he met him and the last time he saw him before “ death took him so swiftly ” there were no “ last words ” and he was enveloped in silence in absence— “ the way death often comes ... ” i see him more clearly through this stranger ’ s eyes i wouldn ’ t have thought that he could help confirm my sense of what is real but this man who knew him less than two years feels so indebted that i allow myself to think of the rider ’ s life in terms of the people he affected the bizarre love he could elicit—not standard preacherly fare by any means but some connection by being entirely present for others— promiscuously present— meanwhile as the nurses haul my mother from wheelchair to bed why do i feel impelled to turn away… we think we have the answers … and flash to an image of my friend caring for her father—bathing him —but she didn ’ t come out of his penis did she or is that another wrong turning in my thought the hospice preacher offers a prayer he holds my mother ’ s swollen psoriatic hand the arthritic clumps poling from her fingers and as the dry flaky patches blaze in the unforgiving light i find not a word to object to—except two— “ religion ” and “ churches. ” i tell him that i left home as soon as i could because i couldn ’ t stand being around the two of them he admits he always felt sick “ for hours afterward ” when he ’ d been with them together it wasn ’ t just quarreling i have to add seeking absolution for my absence but hatred can ’ t let my mother milk the bereaved widow role he nods— matter-of-factly and sets me free
you put this pen in my hand and you take the pen from my hand the night before the full moon the moon seems full what is missing is a dark hungry sickle the sliver of shadow eating us up inside after the mountains breathe their mint-and-sorrow green against the long summer sky they burst into hot october laughter lighting the horizon with citrus rust and blood you put this knife in my hand we pull we meet as oceans come together heaving against and clinging across our salt watery boundary we approach endlessly like two rails of one track tied in a parallel that promises our eyes to merge someplace far off in the distance you put this feather in my palm my fingers close around flight
i see you once i ’ ve got you down to size a two-day-stubble squatter jailbait eyes the bottle-headed trophy mom the mentor always angling his face down from the center of his universe to shine a light on yours the fated anorexic whose allures shimmer in the mirror for her eyes only denying what her denial denies once you become a cliche i can hate you— or treat me tenderly and let me date you but that only retards the writing-off that comes with boredom amour propre or cough irreconcilable differences i.e. those things about you that are least like me yet just slightly different my foible ’ s homophone so in hating yours i really hate my own this keeps the focus where it wants to be— on whom you ask invariably on ... see i didn ’ t even have to say did i i love you so much no need to reply
out the window of the bar i ’ m watching a circle of girls stretching and yawning across the street it ’ s late january and 74 degrees they love the heat because they are a moist heat heat loves heat and today is a tease for what comes with spring around here when the glorious birds funnel back up from mexico the girls don ’ t care about birds because they are birds i recall in high school a half dozen cheerleaders resting on a wrestling mat in short shorts in the gym me beside them with a silly groin ache what were they living lovely warm meat as we all are reaching out of our bodies for someone else
dark days when i awaken so i slump back to the swamp of his armpit a whit from the arachnid he inked to the stump that ’ s left so close to the vestige of it the danger he ’ s a reliquary of tattooed noose to venerate the fist of a slug buried still in his butt above a white cross for the men he didn ’ t miss if only i could strip off the black map i sleep against and be his liniment gloss over the explosion the mishap phantom he feels in a forearm itch he won ’ t leave the long tale his tattoos read for me so i amend the story
now everywhere the pageantry of youth is on display the squeal of bike chains spinning through the gray plays fugue to puddle-froth the punctual blitz of hyacinths in april ushers spring with lavender dripped from the upturned wing of wind-swept gabriel a youngish pair walks wired at the arms— she casually ribbing him he lightly brushing her breast jibbing their step to spare the worms stranded along the road too soon their laughter rises and goes drifting toward silence and now the young man knows love ’ s not the song but after— like the mute remembered chorus of the rain that stains the walk long after falling or the lifeless stalk still hoisting its head of grain uneasy now she loosens from his hand their dark familiars stare back reflected by the passing cars with speechless reprimand before the chill each chartered hell grows hotter yet every burn will teach him how to run—and how to turn her wine back into water
toward what island-home am i moving not wanting to marry not wanting too much of that emptiness at evening as when i walked through a field at dusk and felt wide in the night and it was again the evening that drew me back to the field where i was most alone compassed by stems and ruts no light of the fixed stars no flashing in the eyes only heather pared by dry air shedding a small feathered radiance when i looked away an expanse whose deep sleep seemed an unending warren i had been given to carry out such tasks— that i might find nothing dead and it was again the evening that drew me back to the field where i could sense no boundary— the smell of dry earth cool arch of my neck the darkness entirely within myself and when i shut my eyes there was no one only weeds in drifts of stillness only stalks and gliding sky come black anchor let us not be harmed the deer leafing in the dark the old man at the table unable to remember the children whose hunger is just hunger and never desire

last night when the moon slipped into my attic room as an oblong of light i sensed she ’ d come to commiserate it was august she traveled with a small valise of darkness and the first few stars returning to the northern sky and my room it seemed had missed her she pretended an interest in the bookcase while other objects stirred as in a rock pool with unexpected life strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed the paper-crowded desk the books too appeared inclined to open and confess being sure the moon harbored some intention i waited watched for an age her cool gaze shift first toward a flower sketch pinned on the far wall then glide down to recline along the pinewood floor before i ’ d had enough moon i said we ’ re both scarred now are they quite beyond you the simple words of love say them you are not my mother with my mother i waited unto death
today is a trumpet to set the hounds baying the past is a fox the hunters are flaying nothing unspoken goes without saying love ’ s a casino where lovers risk playing the future ’ s a marker our hearts are prepaying the future ’ s a promise there ’ s no guaranteeing today is a fire the field mice are fleeing love is a marriage of feeling and being the past is a mirror for wishful sightseeing nothing goes missing without absenteeing nothing gets cloven except by dividing the future is chosen by atoms colliding the past ’ s an elision forever eliding today is a fog bank in which i am hiding love is a burn forever debriding love ’ s an ascent forever plateauing nothing is granted except by bestowing today is an anthem the cuckoos are crowing the future ’ s a convolute river onflowing the past is a lawn the neighbor is mowing the past is an answer not worth pursuing nothing gets done except by the doing the future ’ s a climax forever ensuing love is only won by wooing today is a truce between reaping and rueing
this is the multitude the beasts you wanted to show me drawing me upstream all morning up through wind- scoured heather to the hillcrest below us in the next glen is the grave calm brotherhood descended out of winter out of hunger kneeling like the signatories of a covenant their weighty antique-polished antlers rising above the vegetation like masts in a harbor or city spires we lie close together and though the wind whips away our man-and-woman smell every stag-face seems to look toward us toward but not to us we ’ re held and hold them in civil regard i suspect you ’ d hoped to impress me to lift to my sight our shared country lead me deeper into what you know but loath to cause fear you ’ re already moving quietly away sure i ’ ll go with you as i would now almost anywhere

in a light chocolatine room with blackout windows a loud clock drowns in soft dawn ’ s syllables crisscrossed with a broken cloudiness i ’ d choose as my own bedcovers but can not my choice of sleep or sky has no music of its own there ’ s no “ its own ” while the baby cries oh the baby cries he howls and claws like a wrongly minor red wolf who doesn ’ t know his mother i know i am his mother but i can ’ t quite click on the word ’ s essential aspects can ’ t denude the flora or disrobe the kind of housecoat “ mother ” always is something cunty something used whatever meaning the word itself is covering like underwear that meaning is so mere and meager this morning mother baby chicken and egg it ’ s so obnoxious of me i was an egg who had an egg and now i ’ m a chicken as usual scooping up both possibilities or what i used to call possibilities i used to be this way so ontologically greedy wanting to be it all serves me right my belief in the fluidity of the self turns out to mean my me is a flow of wellwater without the well or the bucket a hole dug and seeping a kind of unwell where the ground reabsorbs what it was displaced to give the drain gives meaning to the sieve as i said a chicken who still wants to be all potential someone who springs and falls who can not see how many of us i have in me—and i do not like them all do i like us can i love us if anyone comes first it ’ s him but how can that be i was here way way first i have the breasts godawful and he the lungs and we share the despair for we are a we aren ’ t we we split a self in such a way that there isn ’ t enough for either of us the father of the baby is sleepy and present in his way in the way of fathers he is devoted like few fathers and maybe hurts like i hurt like no fathers i don ’ t know what someone else feels not even these someones who are also me do they hurt like i do why can ’ t they tell me or morse or sign let me know they know where and how and why it hurts or something what is the point of other people being so separate if we can ’ t help a person get that pain will stick its shiv into anything just to get rid of the weapon and because it can for if we share ourselves then they too must also be in so much pain i can hear it oh my loves the wood of the crib the white glow of the milk which must have siphoned off the one and only pure part of me leaving me with what toxicity or sin or mush the awful softness i ’ ve been melted into something too easy to spill i make more and more of myself in order to make more and more of the baby he takes it this making and somehow he ’ s made more of me too i ’ m a mother now i run to the bathroom run to the kitchen run to the crib and i ’ m not even running these places just scare up as needed the wires that move my hands to the sink to the baby to the breast are electrical i ’ m in shock one must be in shock to say so as if one ’ s own state is assessable like a car accident or minnesota taxes a total disaster this sack of liquid flesh which yowls and leaks and i ’ m talking about me not the baby me this puddle of a middle this utilized vessel cracked hull divine design it ’ s how it works it ’ s how we all got here deform following the function but what about me i whisper secretly and to think around these parts used to be the joyful place of sex what is now this intimate terror and squalor my eyes burned out at three a.m. and again at six and eleven this is why the clock is drowning as i said earlier i ’ m trying to explain it i repeat myself or haven ’ t i already tiny self along with a tiny self i ’ ll say it he hurt me this new babe then and now perhaps he always will though thoughts of the future seem like science fiction novels i never finished reading their ends like red nerves chopped off by cleaver not aliens this very moment saving nothing for later he howls with such fury and clarity i must believe him no god has the power to make me believe anything yet i happen to know this baby knows a way out this dark hole closing in on me all around he ’ ll show me how to get through the shock and the godlessness and the rictus of crushed flesh into the rest of my life
what we can say has already been said about each painting in the gallery— about the quality of light the way she holds her head so we are silent in the subway silent in bed our bodies too are mute we fall asleep knowing what we could say has already been said over toast and coffee and the newspaper thoroughly read the day unfolds between us i am too weak to carry this quality of light the way she holds her head i would vow to leave if love had left if this were the wedding of two gypsies but what should i say it has been said the dead would properly bury the dead and here i am alive at last and buried by the quality of light and the way she holds her head perhaps women sex love are all over-rated which of us is the artist and which the light you see the words i might say have been better said— words concerning the quality of light the way you hold your head
you have forgotten it all you have forgotten your name where you lived who you loved why i am simply your nurse terse and unlovely i point to things and remind you what they are chair book daughter soup and when we are alone i tell you what lies in each direction this way is death and this way after a longer walk is death and that way is death but you won ’ t see it until it is right in front of you once after your niece had been to visit you and i said something about how you must love her or she must love you or something useless like that you gripped my forearm in your terrible swift hand and said she is everything—you gave me a shake—everything to me and then you fell back into the well deep in the well of everything and i stand at the edge and call chair book daughter soup

i can ’ t go to the east village anymore because it is like going on a tour of my worst dates i get older my heart leaps at the sight of children who don ’ t belong to me i pronounce everything like an italian opera title i used to listen to songs and have someone in mind for the you parts now i just want to be where the light is intense i want the kind of heat that kills you if you drive into it unprepared this isn ’ t a metaphor for anything else when i speak of the light i mean the light i go to church and sing along and feel just as moved as if my faith were blind when i speak of the blind i mean the light truly the only things lindsay lohan and i have in common are our preoccupations with fame and weight loss and yet i recognize a kinship there as if those two things mattered more than anything when i speak of the darkness i mean this living in a restaurant called caracas i once spent fifteen minutes arguing about an ayn rand book because every time he said anthem i thought he meant we the living and i said what dystopia what about the woman and he said what about the home of the infants and i said what home of the infants what about loving a man so much you ’ ll sleep with another man in order to finance the first man ’ s tuberculosis treatment welcome to russia i said and we were looking at each other and then not i tried to picture caracas tried to leave him for elsewhere a fever
i hope you ’ ve been taken up by jesus though so many decades have passed so far apart we ’ d grown between love transmogrifying into hate and those sad letters and phone calls and your face vanishing into a noose that i couldn ’ t today name the gods you at the end worshipped if any praise being impossible for the devoutly miserable and screw my church who ’ d roast in hell poor suffering bastards like you unable to bear the masks of their own faces with words you sought to shape a world alternate to the one that dared inscribe itself so ruthlessly across your eyes for you could not could never fully refute the actual or justify the sad heft of your body earn your rightful space or pay for the parcels of oxygen you inherited more than once you asked that i breathe into your lungs like the soprano in the opera i loved so my ghost might inhabit you and you ingest my belief in your otherwise-only-probable soul i wonder does your death feel like failure to everybody who ever loved you as if our collective cpr stopped too soon the defib paddles lost charge the corpse punished us by never sitting up and forgive my conviction that every suicide ’ s an asshole there is a good reason i am not god for i would cruelly smite the self-smitten i just wanted to say ha-ha despite your best efforts you are every second alive in a hard-gnawing way for all who breathed you deeply in each set of lungs those rosy implanted wings pink balloons we sigh you out into air and watch you rise like rain
the weight of a man on a woman is like falling into the river without drowning above the world is burning and fighting lost worlds flow through others but down here beneath water ’ s skin river floor sand everything is floating rocking water falls through our hands as we fall through it and when a woman and a man come up from water they stand at the elemental edge of difference mirrored on water ’ s skin they are fired clay water evaporating into air they are where water turns away from land and goes back to enter a larger sea a man and a woman are like those rivers entering a larger sea greater than the sum of all its parts
4 but you had the sense that he was always competing with your father for your affection not only my father he didn ’ t understand my need to develop ties in these new worlds he tried to legislate over my feelings he was subject to extraordinarily inappropriate fits of jealousy how are you the judge of that many small incidents such as… the boy ’ s name was warren he was an orphan as we pulled into the weed lot of the camp in the uncertain march air and patented silence i could see him peeking down at us from a second story dormer window like someone who had been dreaming of escape from the run-down resort torn up turf dirt basketball court net hanging for its life by one thin strand of rope horseshoes shuffle board musty mildewed cabins with wet bedding the stars pressing too hard against our faces in the catastrophic silence of the nights… i ’ d never been left so happily alone alone that is in warren ’ s wonderful company his talk mimicked the cadence of the stones he kicked warren showed me the mica glow in the arrowheads and quartz-tipped spears he 'd unearthed warren 's cigar box overflowed with other people's souvenirs miniature monuments key chains lighters and initialed items like cuff links and bracelets he scoured the corners of the rooms of the departed while his “ mother ” slip of the tongue there vacuumed “ people always leave something behind ” he said i knew what he meant taking their clothes on and off so many times something had to go i wanted an initial bracelet even with someone else ’ s initials the kids at summer camp in the poconos all had initialed bracelets except for me but who among them had been west of the mississippi warren wanted a home i didn ’ t know what i wanted i asked to bring warren home and give him a home “ that ’ s ridiculous he has a home here besides you only just met. ” my mother lamented his stick-thin soot-blackened frame the smell he gave off and his yellow teeth his urchin eating with his hands his short and choppy hair his blousy shirt and baggy fatigues that gave him a bulk a volume he didn ’ t otherwise possess what about his fits of giddy delight as the days passed i forgot myself i became more and more like warren i would brook no insults about my brother it would no longer be me but me and warren i ’ d share my meals with warren and my desk at school warren could stay and i would just—slip away next to warren i felt like i was on a clipper ship lifted out of the water by the powerful wind-breath of my two distant coastal families my warring mother and “ blood ” father her lovely companionable family in los angeles and manhattan his friendly compliant relations in manhattan and bensonhurst… i dreamt both families were jammed on the deck of the ship waving gesticulating shouting and that i clung to a raft ’ s rope as a great wave flung me back and back but the truth was i wasn ’ t sure i wanted to be near i wanted to fly apart—in the nowhere— when our two-door chrysler windsor edged off the gravel onto the highway i thrust my head right where the plush fabric of the front seat parted like the red sea and said to my new dad “ you know what i love warren more than i love you. ” “ you don ’ t know what you ’ re saying ” he snapped “ he ’ s just a little putz and i can get rid of him with a snap of my fingers presto see now—where is he ” the seat beside me was empty i was empty and my heart pounded in wild longing for its fullness lost i should have kept my mouth shut but i thought my heart would burst with that secret locked in it why doesn ’ t he understand it wasn ’ t that i loved him less than i had but that i loved warren more he had the same reaction several years later in chicago when i announced my love for carol a round-faced soft spoken blond girl i ’ d brought home to play with my electric trains and drink hot chocolate one brutal winter afternoon i loved her and i kissed her in the elevator on the way up i wanted him to say i ’ m so happy for you let ’ s put on some 45 ’ s and dance he said “ you do n't know what love is. ” and for the first time slapped me in the face i wrote my “ blood ” father of my love and he wrote back he was glad i was “ making friends out there. ” why didn ’ t these men understand i know what words mean by love i meant love however transitory one word two fathers two red stone faces unblinking dismayed
we are n't differentiable with bangs and hooded lids i know the likeness does n't stop right there what 's so great about being horny the joke is insatiable it rips and roars between and through we both have found our mother 's jewels buried in closets rolled in silk thread and bunting done in scarlet fortunately found never for the men in sharing these are our secrets our punch lines and couplets i went to bed thinking `` pixies '' the bliss and after- math of a spiritual kiss how you resonate without rooms maintaining perfect valences where is the disaster at the end of this dread in my dream state you were queen a reigning bodhisattva without a sprig i climbed inside your belly punched inside you laughed and laughed converting persimmons into a freedom jelly slathered all over i found us exuberant happy to swing or go both ways
and yesterday something shattering happened not yesterday but several that ’ s becoming a favorite word weeks ago i came across kitaj ’ s the jewish rider and wept there he was in the very image of my stepfather the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic the same skinny legs the same misguided attempt to dress in a sporty way who ’ s watching the same abstractedness the same shlumpy—boneless—posture gazing not at the landscape flashing past with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one tug the countryside would vanish or listening to the tick of the rails but fixed—distractedly—on his lower extremities white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon socks to see whether or not he should roll them up … no looking both beyond and through physical space into an inner dark why else draw the eyes as shadows it ’ s his glimpse into another world my mother ’ s father hunted and rode my father rode and fished my stepfather never budged from his barca lounger once the amber liquid began to pour he had a spiritual life and a social life and no physical life but he liked it that i was always outside maybe that ’ s why he never got on my back about grades he might have thought that this boy has to be outside at this time in his life maybe it ’ s more important that he roam the canyons and the hills that he know the streets that he come home covered with leaves and bark and mud than that he sit there like a good young scholar like i was a rabbi at twenty giving money home to my parents in their cabbagy tenement in the bronx this is a boy who needs space one time— i think i had my learner 's permit— he rented a mustang convertible in l.a. and for several days i drove around past the long rows of used car lots and the bruised facades of restaurants digging up relatives my hoarse-voiced arthritic aunt in the shadows of her goldenrod colored ranch house limping like ruffian after her last run in the wet dirt at belmont stakes but i ’ ve said nothing about what made me weep it 's in the contrast between kitaj 's alter cocker seeking comfort on a train and rembrandt ’ s taut youth setting off into the rampant amber on horseback it ’ s in the image of active life juxtaposed with the image of sedentary contemplation— though no one travels on horseback now and heroism has become attending aids patients or sheltering the homeless the raw youth ’ s feet are planted lightly yet firmly in his stirrups his coat glows with many colors not so the jewish rider and yet—there 's something more michael hoffman writes that new york is not what it was when i was too young to have marked the existence of the blue note but i can pick up this trail by walking across the park to the frick and barbara hershey wouldn ’ t have been at the frick in 1959 they don ’ t allow children under sixteen in black skin tight pants black sweater the female uniform of our generation whose male version substitutes black jeans baseball hat and bomber jacket— though who knows what decorous garments she ’ d checked in the cloakroom and white boots with plenty of elizabethan ruff at the edges pausing to look at the polish rider while i scribbled notes her white boots stood out against the dominant dark like the jewish rider ’ s white loafers and that was good because the light in the painting is brief whatever the time of day sunrise or sunset and the rider ’ s gaze looking out over unknown space is inward i followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases where clouds roll over harbors against the whiteness of sails or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms then back to meet wisdom ’ s bared breast in veronese ’ s wisdom and strength… why didn ’ t veronese have the nerve to call his painting woman with bare breasts like tintoretto why an allegorical title when the bare flesh and bones and sinew would have done he spends his life looking not at far off hills or citadels or the lights in the village below he has no choice but to fix on her one bared breast her swelling nipple i can ’ t figure out what landscape he might be facing in the painted world the clatter of rocks and hooves echoes over the stony plain i was no rider but a pretend horse and rider always rode beside my train window—at a canter no matter how fast the rails clicked by— and though he wore a bandana and leaned slightly forward in the saddle to pull himself aboard his gaze wide-ranging yet intent was like the polish rider ’ s even as an only child i was never lonely my mother 's father rode until he was old and on a narrow pass his horse jammed him up against rockface in his narrative of his life this collision marked the ruin of his hip the rise of his cataracts my father rode “ every morning before work. ” i never witnessed that but at a ranch in upper new york state while i bloodied my hands tugging the reins of a frothing giant who would not budge from a weedpatch i watched him disappear in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs as he galloped over a far off hill more at ease in the saddle—in the air— than i ’ d ever seen him in civilian life my woman friend in el paso lives to ride only the jewish rider and i do not ride that ’ s the stuff of events what about the signature inscribed by the sun the dark clouds sinister in just being there thresholds exchanges going on in the village below candles lit in the deep interiors bread wine the plate making its way around the table what about— leaping centuries ahead— the energy from generators blazing like auras through the clouds the scattered lights the rotating tops of ambulances the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese making the rounds apple sauce passing from high chair to bib the wonder bread on a calcified plate children eating heads down in silence communicating through eye movements the mother wiping her lips the father grinning stupidly and drooling the television quacking in the background the perfect suburban night unfolding in bedroom and drive-in and den the sprinkler system ticking the snipers in the tower— this is what the riders guests everywhere and nowhere say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter as night comes down and last night driving to connecticut i understood that the polish rider gleans the permutations of light after dusk that its olive-gray smudges reflect the absence of pitch-darkness i was wrong about the polish rider all along he doesn ’ t depart at nightfall he stops for a moment crossing difficult terrain anticipating rockslide in the night because as the faint light rimming the edges of the sky makes clear night is not absolute black but rough-hewn and curious the rider lives in order to depart the woman who rode she hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house bare trees frost the whole bit i wanted our lives to be like that as rife with silences as a quaker meeting she came to me in her stride dropped her crop on the chair peeled off her britches and boots crawled under the covers her hour in the saddle had “ made her ready. ” i felt like an accessory the wound was open drowsily i rolled onto her no longer caring if she was using me as the new year wore on and black ice made riding a fast track to certain death or paralysis she grew tense came to me now with clinical terms “ schi ” words i worked hard to break down the good news was she was not a true “ split personality ” —the glitch that “ she was divorced from herself and could not love or care. ” the light in her house was like the light before dawn on the last of my rare visits her mother jarred preserves while we watched instant replays of robert kennedy die and die her father skulked upstairs perhaps testing gadgets or wishing me off his daughter or taking precautions i would not overhear what words were ricocheting on his “ hot line ” to the patent office any objective observer standing back from the distraction of the impinging present could see that her torment overleapt any visible signs and that she was— as a wasp “ rider ” —the wrong person for the place she was in her resilience could not be in question she lived to stray from known paths to leap stone fences and break into open fields when her horse went down in an irish bog and she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek— the next day she up and mounted him again when she came to me in the dream last night her smile had loosened how lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse how well it lit up the colors of her hair

at first she thinks the attraction does not fill her with enough blood but with a thing like the dove — white and coloured feathers — bones unlike her own bones that gravity can ’ t pull down a milky thing unlike the seas fills her with a wind — starch rustle of the quick passing of things then silence afterwards of the things that passed — that gave the wind its sound not unlike what split the fireworks in the high school park into fanning particles of flame the peacock that is the world bird of breathing colour between them — bird that is everything to choose from — or the one thing sacred bone of the particular —

i went out to the hazel wood because a fire was in my head and cut and peeled a hazel wand and hooked a berry to a thread and when white moths were on the wing and moth-like stars were flickering out i dropped the berry in a stream and caught a little silver trout when i had laid it on the floor i went to blow the fire a-flame but something rustled on the floor and someone called me by my name it had become a glimmering girl with apple blossom in her hair who called me by my name and ran and faded through the brightening air though i am old with wandering through hollow lands and hilly lands i will find out where she has gone and kiss her lips and take her hands and walk among long dappled grass and pluck till time and times are done the silver apples of the moon the golden apples of the sun

it ends because the beginning won ’ t jumpstart again red smudge of a mouth lipstick everywhere the afterthought a comet leaves on its way out what makes this moment unfold like a fine woman raising herself up from the bathroom floor honky-tonk in the honeyed brown of an eyeball perfume its circus of heart-shaped introductions it ends because the needle always winds up in the lead-out like a man pawing around for broken spectacles after he wakes in the world ’ s rubble hand over hand he paws through stilted guitar picks abandoned stilettos raised skirts rocks glasses as chipped smudged as the topography of a skipping record he could be albright himself foraging the still-life swish of low-rise tutus skyscrapers cracked in the twisted aftermath of a smile even without glasses he remembers her in high style magnanimously coming down the blue violet threads of night her green dress clashing with the bathroom tile
the day turned into the city and the city turned into the mind and the moving trucks trumbled along like loud worries speaking over the bicycle ’ s idea which wove between the more armored vehicles of expression and over planks left by the construction workers on a holiday morning when no work was being done because no matter the day we tend towards remaking parts of it—what we said or did or how we looked— and the buildings were like faces lining the banks of a parade obstructing and highlighting each other defining height and width for each other offsetting grace and function like audrey hepburn from jesse owens and the hearty pigeons collaborate with wrought iron fences and become recurring choruses of memory reassembling around benches we sat in once while seagulls wheel like immigrating thoughts and never-leaving chickadees hop bared hedges and low trees like commas and semicolons landing where needed separating subjects from adjectives stringing along the long ideas showing how the cage has no door and the lights changed so the tide of sound ebbed and returned like our own breath and when i knew everything was going to look the same as the mind i stopped at a lively corner where the signs themselves were like perpendicular dialects in conversation and i put both my feet on the ground took the bag from the basket so pleased it had not been crushed by the mightiness of all else that goes on and gave you the sentence inside

i woke you were lying beside me in the double bed prone your long dark hair fanned out over the downy pillow i ’ d been dreaming we stood on a beach an ocean away watching the waves purl into their troughs and tumble over knit one purl two you said something in your voice made me think of women knitting by the guillotine your eyes met mine the fetch of a wave is the distance it travels you said from where it is born at sea to where it founders to shore i must go back to where it all began you waded in thigh-deep waist-deep breast-deep head-deep until you disappeared i lay there and thought how glad i was to find you again you stirred in the bed and moaned something i heard a footfall on the landing the rasp of a man ’ s cough he put his head around the door he had my face i woke you were not there

trying to see the proportional relation of one memory to another one is so strange and then to try and see what looms and doesn ’ t for the other person who was there it gets stranger especially when you ’ ve read his email i don ’ t know how people understand their lives measure their sensations against “ objective ” or so-to-speak democratic estimations whether people accept the externality of events “ events ” as things that happen to them i refuse to accept some coagulate of other people ’ s impressions in exchange for this privacy no matter how flawed it is this is lyric poetry it has to be it has no other hope what was it about you and me that made whatever happen to us in new york everything fell apart what i dreaded and expected but still tonight it is dark and the weather is cooler than it ’ s been it has taken a while for fall to break the global warming kept me in summer love with you like i was under a fermata now that the times are changing i feel even more for you or i feel nothing i can ’ t tell it ’ s kind of scary i was sick of thinking about you this morning but i was listening to bob dylan and leonard cohen in order to think about you for literary purposes when i feel nothing for a person i get scared i ’ m losing my humanity and that turning cold means my heart ’ s been botoxed we ’ re all fucked i watched a movie on youtube called ladies and gentlemen mister leonard cohen that was made when he was still just a poet and only famous in canada he ’ s a pretentious little nerd in it self-important teacher ’ s pet wit i think that making music he became so much nakeder much more desperate the talent real even pure even natural had to ripen in the artificial man alain badiou on the day of his class said “ because an event is pure rapture an event disappears immediately it does not exist objectively but only by appearing and disappearing. ” this is both precise and vague it is attractive i guess i guess since you and me did not disappear immediately it was not pure rapture not in these terms but my smile was real each time i swallowed your cum getting fucked by you was great i could feel it in my organs but you didn ’ t make me go insane except for maybe once or twice actually maybe i am being unfair maybe the fucking really was that great in this moment i can ’ t remember i just read a poetry review in which the reviewer states that a certain book made his cock feel as though it were tall as a tree that ’ s nice i have no idea what it feels like to have a cock sometimes i feel as though i ’ m getting close to understanding and then something happens to make me have no clue again when sinan fucks me we lose our individuality so severely it ’ s like we ’ re both gasping after an animal that ’ s his cock that is beyond us and i lose all sense of the world his cock ’ s not even him and he ’ s not him either and we aren ’ t anything it ’ s strange the possessive didn ’ t thomas mann write a book called herr und hund or something like that man ’ s best friend what belongs to him me and sunder talked about how scary and arousing it is to watch men masturbate cos everyone relates differently to his like dicks are always almost but never quite another je est un autre said that brat arthur rimbaud i am definitely in love with you as i write this you are so petty and superfluous i can not stand you sinan is definitely in love with me i know because i saw him tonight i love him too you are gracious to accord me the space and time in which to develop or to elaborate upon as the french say these extreme emotions i am despite the odds and certain lapses so capable of feeling it was good to slap your face and to admit that your asshole made me nervous your eyes had a way of going soft and shiny when you said the really tender things we admitted it was intimidating for us both to hear each other describe people we ’ ve fucked and been in love with i ’ m proud of what we accomplished together alain badiou ended his class with a reading of “ ariane et barbe-bleue ” which is an opera by paul dukas you and me had gone pretty far by the time this day came and something very fragile in me breaks when somebody says my name or even a variant of it i was tired i think badiou discusses “ ariane ” in being and event which i have not read in class he said that the story of the opera is about the relationship between law and freedom and that it shows that the desire for freedom is not so simple ariane experiences an event that causes her to demand freedom badiou said but she is unable to convince anybody else any other women to want freedom she ends up alone she genuinely falls in love with the wicked bluebeard at the beginning bluebeard who previously got women by having a castle to lock them in this woman ariane does not have to be taken by force when she enters his castle he hands her seven keys six of which he gives her permission to use and leaves she hears the cries of his other imprisoned wives coming from behind a door so she uses the forbidden key releasing them meanwhile bluebeard is assaulted by the local peasants who want to free ariane fearing her fate will turn out like that of the women who came before her but ariane is already free in herself and proves this freedom by bringing the wounded bluebeard home caring tenderly for him and then declaring that she ’ s leaving him for good by the end bluebeard ’ s shattered sobbing bleeding ariane invites the other wives to leave with her in a wrenching aria pleading with them one by one to taste with her the freedom awaiting them the world but they all prefer confinement even though they had longed for freedom before ariane opened their door once liberty arrived they were no longer capable of it preferring to serve even a gutted hollowed-out power ariane exits alone the end badiou narrated this with emotion and i cried maybe cos i was tired and that thing about my name or because i am not heroic or free i had missed half of alain badiou ’ s lectures messing around with you on the couch by the fire in the women ’ s toilets up on the hill if this were a suitable parable and it isn ’ t i would try to tell myself that those very early mornings in brooklyn when i sat up in your bed feeling wrong and got dressed and walked away i should have stayed away cos i don ’ t need you maybe i don ’ t need you but i want you maybe i don ’ t love you but i am getting to know you maybe what made me cry in class was how tired i was and how sad and hard it is and how rare to undertake an act that ’ s truly free and not just a response to a confused surge of drives and fears
eight stars make a soft solfege above this motel where there are never stars i let a skinny man put his long thick dick in me for you so we could break our hearts the way you want me to somewhere a white wall stretches up behind the backs of a tribe whose obscurity protects its secret from the common world and the connivances it ordains what time is it what season is it i don ’ t know the moon blows green gas into my skull i want to hide what i dream in a big boot and wear the boot and starve as i lean upon the boot of my destitution and drag the truth as a gimp would drag the weight of her body that would give me a feeling of honesty
love is an interruption or an aberration a force in opposition to the ultimate inertia of the universe wrote marguerite duras whether or not it is worth it it occurs whether or not it is to be believed it is the wind moves us without a frond being needed to be held by a slave girl the rudiments of sentences are ancient without a mouth needing to remember what it is losing as it lets those words out something eviller than what they even mean right now something too evil to be known right now or ever i feel sure that even the most culpable people have other qualities secreted away adjusting their garments in light of fate he turned his head upward he looked up the white wall the light from the lamp could be light coming from a great distance it could be a great distance away and the wall could be snow it is so beautiful he said his head looking up the wall his eyes looking up it he said that nail in the wall could also be beautiful for so far away
why speak of hate when i do bleed for love not hate my love but love doth bite my tongue till i taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough so flatter i my fever for the one for whom i inly mourn though seem to shun a rose is arrows is eros so what if i confuse the shade that i ’ ve become with winedark substance in a lover ’ s cup but stop my tonguely wound i ’ ve bled enough if i be fair or false or freaked with fear if i my tongue in lockèd box immure blame not me for i am sick with love yet would i be your friend most willingly since friendship would infect me killingly
there is a chair the heart of which is wooden split five ways and grass pressed flat where we kissed where others later kissed on the same mattress and solemn nothing happening under a canopy— have you forgotten me i will go down wonderfully as was told in proverbs though for a long time i thought i should not go here are things that have no latin names or none that men would know
chandelier too full of brilliance to be indolent your prisms enunciate the light and don ’ t need rain to break it into rainbows snow with six crutches in each crystal your livery your glitter your purring made visible only inanimate things can sparkle without sweat my spinet the threat of music in its depths and miniature busts of men composers carved of time on top the hollow bench held sheet music sing me charm gets in your eyes i hear you best when undistracted by your body in headspace technology where flowers are living in glass globes their fragrance vivisected anything that blooms that long will seem inanimate heaven grief like the sea keeps going over the same wrought ground the whole spent moan praise dies in my throat or in the spooky rift between itself and its intended like a wish- bone breaking the little crutch inside is not a toy there is no night asylum a restless bed a haunt preserve a blanket rough as sailcloth but sing me was it kind snow sometimes with true divided lights and nothing flawed about it if song goes wrong be dancerly dance me at what point does west turn to east as it spins i ’ ve never understood perspective how charm gets to yes dance me exile and the queendom by request it is a ferocious thing to have your body as your instrument glove over glove let your dance express what i ’ ve been creeping like a vein of sweat through a vastness of this tune with mountains tied inside and many silent letters can be read as trackers scan the spaces between toes and birders read the rustle left by birds as any mammal in its private purr hole knows the little crutch inside is not a crutch more a sort of steeple neither silver to be chased nor gold to be beaten you were==you are more than ever like that too noon upon noon you customize this solitude with spires that want nothing from me and rise with no objective as everything does when happy
after william ix duke of aquitaine as sweetness flows through these new days the woods leaf out and songbirds phrase in neumes of roosted melody incipits to a new song then love should find lubricity and quicken having slept so long the bloodroot blossoms well and good but i receive no word that would set my troubled heart at ease nor could we turn our faces toward the sun and open by degrees unless we reach a clear accord and so our love goes night and day it ’ s like the thorny hawthorn spray that whips about in a bitter wind from dusk to dawn shellacked with sleet until the sun ’ s first rays ascend through leaves and branches spreading heat i have in mind one april morning when she relented without warning relenting from her cold rebuff in laughter peals of happiness sweet christ let me live long enough to get my hands beneath her dress i hate the elevated talk that disregards both root and stalk and sets insipid pride above vicissitudes of lust and strife let others claim a higher love we ’ ve got the bread we ’ ve got the knife

in sympathy with gaspara stampa by woman so touched so pressed detachment being thought achievable at all is boggling in itself its being thought achievable by love—but love for only all not someone ’ s single sentience— appears the precept of too cold a form of flame how much of a hand in things relinquishes the hold of things-at-hand what kiss might such a mind reclaim a swirl of dust in buddhist schools perhaps a view of several solar systems from above not love the thought appeals as it appals slow learners we must spurn the selving sensualities to feel for feelers of this kind unfasten passion ’ s burner to identify what ’ s under it— in short must court dispassion just to be compassionate

abandoned in a field near yass a cobwebbed car once kept us warm and when it rained though we shivered with sickness there came a moment of perfect happiness faces nestled in the vinyl sleep coming on surrounded by metal that in upcoming decades would oxidise to flakes asleep at last last of the valium we came to know a car too is a flower and pollen its decay in the dry air at dawn the cicadas kept still the space that mass sat in decided how mass was to move we dreamed of valleys of olive trees silver side out the lions preened we shivered with need a mechanic showed me once how the spark-paths from spark-plugs looked if you looked close enough like mountain ravines from the air the deeper the groove the faster the current we shivered this our habit this flowing it takes the breath away there are gum trees crackling from it two decades later i slept so still beneath that mass of dreams like sediment compressed beneath a lake i woke and the tributes and glory were gone and the crops all withered and money was merely the index of anxiety when we realised this our hearts swelled in exultation even time would forget there was reason for fear that decay seemed to will itself upon us i was off the air delirious with substance the kite hawks grew ashamed all nature squirmed i was off the air light-headed with voracity the theme just kept repeating itself year in year out same demon different bodies a nurse said when you stay when you leave those wet imprints in our airspace these sheets smell like formaldehyde like death we had merely reached early down the end of the river the leprosarium of feeling and all things stood for every other thing creepers vines tendrils anacondas inert surrender such listlessness and yes the very rage with which we chased the very forms of it the lineaments of nothingness the powders of the comatose the bliss this was the state of the world heading backwards we learned the flea-fish was the smallest animal before the insect kingdom began forwards there were only the sudden deaths of galaxies and yet when we practised love there seemed on certain days an awful lot of space and so much sky never had i lain then at kangaroo valley so comfortable in my own body a virtual flatness and that centrifuge in the stomach stilled and my spine a spirit-level the smell of coffee drifting in brought back to me that lily-white girl and that sad hour of need how brittle every bone was then how could one not be completely bedraggled by time or compulsion or duplicity i was all those things and am i was so tired with the not-being-here inside of it all that fatigue was like oxygen given of all the givens sensurround of the gods but i was gulping and heaving by then and that is all so long ago though when you forget the last time most likely it is not the last time and when dreams don ’ t come when mastodons and minotaurs curdle in the night-reaches and the bulls lie fallow in dawn-sweats sleep some more wait sleep on and swim
and if every step taken is a step well-lived but a foot towards death every pilgrimage a circle every flight-path the tracing of a sphere i will give myself over and over i have migrated through carpathians of sorrow to myself heaped happy in the corner there nothing seemed strange in the world you ’ ll understand— nothing ever more would monkey boy came to me saying look—the moon of the moon the little one circled the big one he crouched in the palm of my hand tiny sincere pointing at the sky there was something sad about him the python was nothing nothing at all nothing but strength shed to suppleness nothing but will encased in itself the python was a muscle of thought coiled and mute in a place where nothing but rain fell the python thought this is the beginning or end of the world the python was everywhere everywhere at once aware only too much of that ageless agony its existence i am tired it said and the stream burbled by i am waiting for the recoil the uncoil coil of night coil of stars coil of the coldness of the water the python said who are these people the whole city sweated moved like a limb the air fitted like a glove two sizes too small and too many singers sang the banal the bars roared all night the kite hawks grew ashamed all nature squirmed in the yellow time of pollen there ’ s a certain slant of light that devours the afternoon and you would wait forever at the gare de l ’ est if time stood still if she would come she is the leopard then its silvery speed where will you wrestle her and in what shadows and on what crumpled sheets and all those sheets were pampas and savannas the soft expanses of all that would be absent forever all that was past and future and not here and in a white rose there were not to be found any secrets since in its unfolding there was no centre nor in its decay only the random petals fallen in the yellow time of poppies when the fields were ablaze those invisible pollens rained around us the days held us lightlocked in golden surrender and all night long the night shot stars when my chest unconstricted at last did yours the real issue of course was this atomically energetically everything was wave function and a wave continues forever into space the wavelength never alters only the intensity lessens so in the worst cosmic way everything is connected by vibrations and this as even a dog would know is no consolation ah but the dogs will save us all in the end even the planet not the superdogs but the household friendlies always eager to please hysterically fond incessant carrying in the very wagging of their tales an unbounded love not even therapists could imagine their forgiveness unhinges us we were reduced to this this day and night primary gold and indigo the binary profusion of distances guessed at heat and cold colours logged in the retina and lodged in the spine we were dogs who knew the infinite is now that celandine was buttercup that buttercup was marigold the dog star marked the dog days and the wild rose was dog rose the crow ’ s-foot was wild hyacinth by day the correspondences were clear i walked across the whin land speedwell bluer than sky a practised ear could hear between two breaths deep space wherein the mind collects itself words foundered and cracked nearly never bulled the cow a shining isomorphousness rang out the roussignol sang all night all colours were shuffled endlessly but never lost a practised ear could hear between two breaths the secret blackness of the snow come flooding in on summer ’ s lawns the ice-melt sprayed its figure-eights from sprinklers and everything stopped working second time around as if it had never happened before fans moved the corpses of fireflies through the rooms supplicant pathetic pleading in brittle postures everything was magnified by their bug-eyed deaths we became solemn in that profusion of dying cane toads fattened the asphalt in the mist and the rain our headlights caught them tensed as if listening they were waiting mute for the imbecility of eternity the clocks merely pulsed or rather the days like shotgun spray on the weatherboard sleep scattered itself through the blurred heat and secreted itself in the nooks of delirium sometimes the magpies would wake us or the phone mid-afternoon and we needed nothing not even hope being no different from the dragonflies or the cows in their despair it appeared we lived on sunlight and chocolate bars you blossomed so from not ever reading the newspapers things came and went—the years and all the airports i was a shade scattering my shade seed liberally to the winds and weathervanes there was not enough absence to go round i heard voices stabat mater in the whine of jets and in air vents and headphones a stream trilling over rocks on tarmacs and in transit i saw your lips your nakedness the trees that dappled light i dreamt of orchards the preciseness of the world came flooding in
i like to lie with you wordless on black cloud rooft beach in late june 5 o ’ clock tempest on clump weed bed with sand fitting your contours like tailor made and i like to wash my summer brown face in north cold hudson rapids with octagon soap knees niched in steamy rocks where last night ’ s frog stared at our buddhist sleep but most of all i like to see the morning happen i like to go down vertical mountains where lanny goshkitch meditated crashing poplars sap sticky arms flailing as thermosed green tea anoints sneakers and blood soakt brow i taste and love myself a split second and i like to feel my own full scrotum as i horizon the whole crisp linen earth in my beatitude waiting miguel-like in maskt fantasy for christ-like you— whoever you are but most of all i like to see the morning happen i like to look at books howl haikus of the seasons of the mind that i might know the knowing and the simplest to think of all of us taking turns at catching each other in the rye and i like to taste cold absinthe on hot hung sunday mornings discussing orgies symposiums and sounds with hoary headed poets in upstairs jazz club in japan but most of all i like to see the morning happen when k and ike still sleep and only the denver night riders hum contrasts to orient jazzy feather beasts in the dewy garden of real earth where i can sink my naked feet cool
immersed we don ’ t ask who entered whose stream take my hand there is no line no bridge only fond foolishness— the bread crumbs i bring you in morning— they float on the surface water with two violins un- strung like the silent song on your lips soft as the same hands i crushed to keep you from death
i 'm at a double wake in springfield for a childhood friend and his father who died years ago i join my aunt in the queue of mourners and walk into a brown study a sepia room with books and magazines the father's in a coffin he looks exhumed the worse for wear but where my friend 's remains should be there 's just the empty base of an urn where are his ashes his mother hands me a paper cup with pills leucovorin zovirax and azt `` henry wanted you to have these '' she sneers `` take all you want for all the good they 'll do '' `` dlugos meester dlugos '' a lamp snaps on raquel not welch the chubby nurse is standing by my bed it 's 6 a.m. time to flush the heplock and hook up the i.v line false dawn is changing into day infusing the sky above the hudson with a flush of light my roommate stirs beyond the pinstriped curtain my first time here on g-9 the aids ward the cheery d d building intentionality of the decor made me feel like jumping out a window i 'd been lying on a gurney in an e.r corridor for nineteen hours next to a psychotic druggie with a voice like abbie hoffman 's he was tied up or down with strips of cloth he 'd tried to slug a nurse and sent up a grating adenoidal whine all night `` nurse nurse untie me please these rags have strange powers '' by the time they found a bed for me i was in no mood to appreciate the clever curtains in my room the same fabric exactly as the drapes and sheets of a p-town guest house in which i once—partied stayed all i can remember is the pattern nor did it help to have the biggest queen on the nursing staff clap his hands delightedly and welcome me to aids-land i wanted to drop dead immediately that was the low point today these people are my friends in the process of restoring me to life a second time i can walk and talk and breathe simultaneously now i draw a breath and sing `` happy birthday '' to my roommate joe he 's 51 today i did n't think he 'd make it three weeks ago they told him that he had aplastic anemia and nothing could be done joe had been a rotten patient moaning operatically throwing chairs at nurses when he got the bad news there was a big change he called the relatives with whom he had been disaffected was anointed and communicated for the first time since the age of eight when he was raped by a priest and made a will as death drew nearer joe grew nicer almost serene then the anemia began to disappear not because of medicines but on its own ready to die it looks like joe has more of life to go he 'll go home soon `` when will you get out of here '' he asks me i do n't know when the x-ray shows no more pneumonia i 've been here three weeks this time what have i accomplished read some balzac spent `` quality time '' with friends come back from death 's door and prayed prayed a lot barry bragg a former lover of a former lover and a new episcopalian has aids too and gave me a leatherbound and gold-trimmed copy of the office the one with all the antiphons my list of daily intercessions is as long as a russian novel i pray about aids last last week i made a list of all my friends who 've died or who are living and infected every day since i 've remembered someone i forgot to list this morning it was chasen gaver the performance poet from dc i do n't know if he 's still around i liked him and could never stand his poetry which made it difficult to be a friend although i wanted to defend him one excruciating night at a folio reading where chasen snapped his fingers and danced around spouting frothy nonsense about andy warhol to the rolling eyes of self-important `` language- centered '' poets whose dismissive attitude and ugly manners were worse by far than anything that chasen ever wrote charles was his real name a classmate at antioch dubbed him `` chasen '' after the restaurant i guess once i start remembering so much comes back there are forty-nine names on my list of the dead thirty-two names of the sick cookie mueller changed lists saturday they all will i guess the living i mean unless i go before them in which case i may be on somebody ’ s list myself it ’ s hard to imagine so many people i love dying but no harder than to comprehend so many already gone my beloved bobby maniac and boyfriend barry reminded me that he had sex with bobby on the coat pile at this christmas party two years in a row that ’ s the way our life together used to be a lot of great adventures who ’ ll remember bobby ’ s stories about driving in his debutante date ’ s father ’ s white mercedes from hole to hole of the golf course at the poshest country club in birmingham at 3 a.m. or taking off his clothes in the redneck bar on a dare or working on stay hungry as the dresser of a then- unknown named schwarzenegger who will be around to anthologize his purple cracker similes “ sweatin ’ like a nigger on election day ” “ hotter than a half-fucked fox in a forest fire. ” the ones that i remember have to do with heat bobby shirtless sweating on the dance floor of the tiny bar in what is now a shelter for the indigent with aids on the dockstrip stripping shirts off chuck shaw barry bragg and me rolling up the tom rags using them as pom-poms then bolting off down west street gracefully despite the overwhelming weight of his inebriation vaulting over trash cans as he sang “ i like to be in america ” in a puerto rican accent when i pass who ’ ll remember who will care about these joys and wonders i ’ m haunted by that more than by the faces of the dead and dying a speaker crackles near my bed and nurses streak down the corridor the black guy on the respirator next door bought the farm maria tells me later but only when i ask she has tears in her eyes she ’ d known him since his first day on g-9 a long time ago will i also become a fond fondly regarded regular back for stays the way retired retiring widowers return to the hotel in nova scotia or provence where they vacationed with their wives i expect so although that ’ s down the road today ’ s enough to fill my plate a bell rings like the gong that marks the start of a fight it ’ s 10 and derek ’ s here to make the bed derek who at 16 saw bob marley ’ s funeral in the football stadium in kingston hot tears pouring down his face he sings as he folds linens “ you can fool some of the people some of the time ” dancing a little softshoe as he works there ’ s a reason he came in just now divorce court drones on joe ’ s tv and derek is hooked i can ’ t believe the script is plausible to him jamaican hipster that he is but he stands transfixed by the parade of faithless wives and screwed-up husbands the judge is testy so am i unwilling auditor of drivel phone my friends to block it out david jane and eileen i missed the bash for david ’ s magazine on monday and eileen ’ s reading last night jane says that marie-christine flew off to marseilles where her mother has cancer of the brain reminding me that aids is just a tiny fragment of life ’ s pain eileen has been thinking about bobby too the dinner that we threw when he returned to new york after getting sick pencil-thin disfigured by ks he held forth with as much kinetic charm as ever what we have to cherish is not only what we can recall of how things were before the plague but how we each responded once it started people have been great to me an avalanche of love has come my way since i got sick and not just moral support jaime ’ s on the board of pen ’ s new fund for aids he ’ s helping out don windham slipped a check inside a note and brad gooch got me something from the howard brookner fund who ’ d have thought when we dressed up in ladies ’ clothes for a night for a hoot in brad “ june buntt ” and howard “ lili la lean ” ’ s suite at the chelsea that things would have turned out this way howard is dead at 35 chris cox “ kay sera sera ” ’ s friend bill gone too “ bernadette of lourdes ” guess who with aids god knows how many positive those 14th street wigs and enormous stingers and martinis don ’ t provoke nostalgia for a time when love and death were less inextricably linked but for the stories we would tell the morning after best when they involved our friends second-best our heroes j.j. mitchell was master of the genre when he learned he had aids i told him he should write them down his mind went first i ’ ll tell you one of his best j.j. was jerome robbins ’ houseguest at bridgehampton every morning they would have a contest to see who could finish the times crossword first robbins always won until a day when he was clearly baffled grumbling scratching over letters he finally threw his pen down “ j.j. tell me what i ’ m doing wrong. ” one clue was “ great 20th-c. choreographer. ” the solution was “ massine ” but robbins had placed his own name in the space every word around it had been changed to try to make the puzzle work except that answer at this point there ’ d be a horsey laugh from j.j. — “ isn ’ t that great ” he ’ d say through clenched teeth “ locust valley lockjaw ” it was and there were lots more where that one came from only you can ’ t get there anymore he ’ s dropped into the maw waiting for the g-9 denizens and for all flesh as silent as the hearts that beat upon the beds up here the heart of the drop- dead beautiful east village kid who came in yesterday charles frost ’ s heart nine inches from the spleen they ’ re taking out tomorrow the heart of the demented girl whose screams roll down the hallways late at night hearts that long for lovers for reprieve for old lives for another chance my heart so calm most days sinks like a brick to think of all that heartache i ’ ve been staying sane with program tools turning everything over to god “ as i understand him. ” i don ’ t understand him thank god i read so much calvin last spring the absolute necessity of blind obedience to a sometimes comforting sometimes repellent always incomprehensible source of light and life stayed with me god can seem so foreign a parent from another country like my dad and his own father speaking polish in the kitchen i wouldn ’ t trust a father or a god too much like me though that is why i pack up all my cares and woes and load them on the conveyor belt the speed of which i can ’ t control like chaplin on the assembly line in modern times or lucy on tv i don ’ t need to run machines today i ’ m standing on a moving sidewalk headed for the dark or light whatever ’ s there duncan hannah visits and we talk of out-of-body experiences his was amazing bingeing on vodka in his dorm at bard he woke to see a naked boy in fetal posture on the floor was it a corpse a classmate a pickup from the blackout of the previous night duncan didn ’ t know he struggled out of bed walked over to the youth and touched his shoulder the boy turned it was duncan himself my own experience was milder don ’ t make me flee screaming from the room as duncan did it happened on a tibetan meditation weekend at the cowley fathers ’ house in cambridge michael koonsman led it healer whose enormous paws directed energy he touched my spine to straighten up my posture and i gasped at the rush we were chanting to tara goddess of compassion and peace in the basement chapel late at night i felt myself drawn upward not levitating physically but still somehow above my body a sense of bliss surrounded me it lasted ten or fifteen minutes when i came down my forehead hurt the spot where the “ third eye ” appears in buddhist art felt as though someone had pushed a pencil through it the soreness lasted for a week michael wasn ’ t surprised he did a lot of work with people with aids in the epidemic ’ s early days but when he started losing weight and having trouble with a cough he was filled with denial by the time he checked into st. luke ’ s he was in dreadful shape the respirator down his throat squelched the contagious enthusiasm of his voice but he could still spell out what he wanted to say on a plastic ouija board beside his bed when the doctor who came in to tell him the results of his bronchoscopy said “ father i ’ m afraid i have bad news ” michael grabbed the board and spelled “ the truth is always good news. ” after he died i had a dream in which i was a student in a class that he was posthumously teaching with mock annoyance he exclaimed “ oh tim i can ’ t believe you really think that aids is a disease ” there ’ s evidence in that direction i ’ ll tell him if the dream recurs the shiny hamburger-in-lucite look of the big lesion on my face the smaller ones i daub with makeup the loss of forty pounds in a year the fatigue that comes on at the least convenient times the symptoms float like algae on the surface of the grace that buoys me up today arthur comes in with the sacrament and we have to leave the room joe ’ s italian family has arrived for birthday cheer to find some quiet walk out to the breezeway where it might as well be august for the stifling heat on amsterdam pedestrians and drivers are oblivious to our small aerie as we peer through the grille like cloistered nuns since leaving g-9 the first time i always slow my car down on this block and stare up at this window to the unit where my life was saved it ’ s strange how quickly hospitals feel foreign when you leave and how normal their conventions seem as soon as you check in from below it ’ s like checking out the windows of the west street jail hard to imagine what goes on there even if you know firsthand the sun is going down as i receive communion i wish the rite ’ s familiar magic didn ’ t dull my gratitude for this enormous gift i wish i had a closer personal relationship with christ which i know sounds corny and alarming janet campbell gave me a remarkable ikon the last time i was here christ is in a chair a throne and st. john the divine an androgyne who looks a bit like janet rests his head upon the savior ’ s shoulder james madden priest of cowley dead of cancer earlier this year at 39 gave her the image telling her not to be afraid to imitate st. john there may come a time when i ’ m unable to respond with words or works or gratitude to aids a time when my attitude caves in when i ’ m as weak as the men who lie across the dayroom couches hour after hour watching sitcoms drawing blanks maybe my head will be shaved and scarred from surgery maybe i ’ ll be pencil- thin and paler than a ghost pale as the vesper light outside my window now it would be good to know that i could close my eyes and lean my head back on his shoulder then as natural and trusting as i ’ d be with a cherished love at this moment chris walks in christopher earl wiss of kansas city and new york my lover my last lover my first healthy and enduring relationship in sobriety the man with whom i choose to share what i have left of life and time this is the hardest and happiest moment of the day g-9 is no place to affirm a relationship two hours in a chair beside my bed after eight hours of work night after night for weeks … it ’ s been a long haul and chris gets tired last week he exploded “ i hate this i hate your being sick and having aids and lying in a hospital where i can only see you with a visitor ’ s pass i hate that this is going to get worse. ” i hate it too we kiss embrace and chris climbs into bed beside me to air-mattress squeaks hold on we hold on to each other to a hope of how we ’ ll be when i get out let him hold on please don ’ t let him lose his willingness to stick with me to make love and to make love work to extend the happiness we ’ ve shared please don ’ t let aids make me a monster or a burden is my prayer too soon chris has to leave i walk him to the elevator bank then totter back so raquel can open my i.v again it ’ s not even mid-evening but i ’ m nodding off my life ’ s so full even especially when i ’ m here on g-9 when it ’ s time to move on to the next step that will be a great adventure too helena hughes tibetan buddhist tells me that there are three stages in death the first is white like passing through a thick but porous wall the second stage is red the third is black and then you ’ re finished ready for the next event i ’ m glad she has a road map but i don ’ t feel the need for one myself i ’ ve trust enough in all that ’ s happened in my life the unexpected love and gentleness that rushes in to fill the arid spaces in my heart the way the city glow fills up the sky above the river making it seem less than night when joe o ’ hare flew in last week he asked what were the best times of my new york years i said “ today

right place
talking to my friend emily whose drinking patterns and extravagance of personal feeling are a lot like mine i ’ m pretty convinced when she explains the things we do while drinking a cocktail to celebrate the new account turns into a party that lasts till 3 a.m. and a terrific hangover indicate a problem of a sort i ’ d not considered i ’ ve been worried about how i metabolize the sauce for four years since my second bout of hepatitis when i kissed all the girls at christmas dinner and turned bright yellow christmas night but never about whether i could handle it it ’ s been more of a given the stage set for my life as an artistic queer as much of a tradition in these new york circles as incense for catholics or german shepherds for the blind we re-enact the rituals and our faces like smoky icons in a certain light seem to learn nothing but understand all it comforts me yet isn ’ t all that pleasant like drinking ripple to remember high school a friend of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades talking to the same types but progressively fewer blonds joe lesueur says he ’ s glad to have been a young man in the fifties with his tab hunter good looks because that was the image men desired now it ’ s the puerto rican angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity that springs out of machismo rather than a moral choice his argument is pretty convincing too except lots of the pretty blonds i ’ ve known default by dying young leaving the field to the swarthy cameron burke the dancer and waiter at magoo ’ s killed on his way home from the pines when a car hit his bike on the sunrise highway henry post dead of aids a man i thought would be around forever surprising me by his mortality the way i was surprised when i heard he was not the grandson of emily post at all just pretending like the friend he wrote about in playgirl blair meehan was faking when he crashed every a list party for a year by pretending to be kay meehan ’ s son a masquerade that ended when a hostess told him “ your mother ’ s here ” and led him by the hand to the dowager—woman behold thy son—underneath a darkening conviction that all if not wrong was not right by now henry may have faced the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky stay as outrageously nasty as you were and patrick mack locked into memory as he held court in the anvil by the downstairs pinball machine and writhing as he danced in lita hornick ’ s parlor when the stimulators played her party dead last week of causes i don ’ t know as if the cause and not the effect were the problem my blond friend chuck shaw refers to the bone- crusher in the sky and i ’ m starting to imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods flickering on at twilight as i used to do in the years when i crashed more parties and acted more outrageously and met more beauties and made more enemies than ever before or ever again i pray it ’ s spring and there ’ s another crop of kids with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self-esteem from my arrival in new york who plug into the history of prettiness convincing to themselves and the devout we who are about to catch the eye of someone new salute as the cotillion passes led by blonds and followed by the rest of us a formal march to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia that hides the trash sprout magically at our approach i toast it as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent as a blond in love my clothes smell like the smoky bar but the sweetness of the april air ’ s delicious when i step outside and fill my lungs leaning my head back in a first-class seat on the shuttle between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds to come and an enormous irish wake in which the corpses change but the party goes on forever
the sun met the moon at the corner noon in thin air commotion you later choose to notice love shapes the heart that once was pieces you take in hand the heart in mind your fate ’ s consistent alongside mine unless a mess your best guess that is right thanks the intimate fact that you elect it at corners dressed or naked with lips taste full body time thick or thin fixated love take heart as heart takes shape and recognition ceases to be obscure one line down the center another flying outward enters
brutal to give the prisoner a window— a blue sky glimpse— as if an afterlife existed brutal for you to parade in a body in the same room where i dream you
there 's a certain sadness to this body of water adjacent to the runway its reeds and weeds handful of ducks the water color manmade a still life and still life 's a cold exercise in looking back back to florida craning my neck like a sandhill crane in alachua basin as for the scrub oaks the hot wind in the leaves was language spanish moss—dusky parasitic— an obsession i wanted to live in it one professor in exile did covered himself in the stuff as a joke— then spent a week removing mites that's enough the fields of rushes lay filled with water and i said farewell my high ship an old red volvo dl gone to another coast another peninsula one without sleep or amphibious music tonight in flight from san francisco— because everything is truer at a remove— i watch the man i love watch the turn of the sacramento river then sacramento lit city of legislation and flat land i think of florida how flat i think of forgetting florida and then the landscape grows black
after twenty years of marriage we walked out of the bush and on to a rough dirt road we followed till we saw a pond we might be able to get to the ground was boggy and buzzing the pond was thick with weed and slime it was not the sort of pond anyone would swim in but we did — picking and sliding into the water over the bog and bees bees we suddenly noticed were everywhere were settling on our hair as we swam ducks turning surprised eyes our way after twenty years of marriage what is surprising isn ’ t really so much the person you are with but to find yourselves so out of place in this scene cold but not able to get out without stepping over bees so many bees
two feet of snow at my parents ’ place in another season here the cicadas sing like christian women ’ s choirs in a disused cotton mill belief is a kind of weather i haven ’ t seen proper snow for three years the new urban forest for native plants and birds will be splendid if the local cats don ’ t kill the birds the problem is all my sympathies are with the cats the friendly disturbers are more endearing than what they disturb a trimaran called 3rd degree spinning around its cable in the channel that ’ s how love is here and should be everywhere it seems so unserious or contentedly ironic it ’ s the kind of thing you either look through or ignore but you ’ d be wrong the question isn ’ t why is love so strange here it ’ s why did it feel normal somewhere else in quiet places the present is just gossip about the past the future is a critique of that all my best
for rwt the other day i was thinking about the term pyramid scheme and why they called it pyramid scheme and not triangle scheme and i asked you what you thought you thought it added a certain gravitas and linked the idea of economic prosperity with some of history ’ s greatest architectural achievements unconsciously suggesting a silent wealth of gold and heat a triangle is two dimensional and therefore a less striking mental image than the idea of a third dimension of financial fraud which is how many dimensions of financial fraud the term pyramid scheme suggests but i had to pause for a second at the financial fraud part because it occurred to me i didn ’ t know what pyramid schemes really were i knew they had something to do with people getting money from nothing like the person at the top of the pyramid scheme or more accurately triangle scheme acquires a number of investors and takes their money and then pays the first lot of investors with the money from another bunch of investors and so on and so forth all the way to the bottom of the triangle or pyramid face which is the kind of stupid thing that happens if you keep your money in a pyramid and not a bank account although if you ask me banks are the real pyramid schemes after all or was love the real pyramid scheme i can ’ t remember maybe it ’ s better to keep your money in a pyramid than a bank and i should shop around and compare the interest rates on different pyramids maybe i should open up a savings pyramid with a whole bunch of trapdoors and malarias to keep the financial anthropologists i mean bankers out my emeralds cooling under the ground like beautiful women ’ s eyes i think this was supposed to be a metaphor for something but i can ’ t remember where i was going with it and now it ’ s been swept away by the winds of whatever but knowing me it was probably love that great dark blue sex hope that keeps coming true that cartoon black castle with a single bird flying over it i don ’ t know where this poem ends how far below the sand but it ’ s still early evening and you and i are a little drunk you answer the phone you pour me a drink i know you hate the domestic in poetry but you should have thought of that before you invited me to move in with you i used to think arguments were the same as honesty i used to think screaming was the same as passion i used to think pain was meaningful i no longer think pain is meaningful i never learned anything good from being unhappy i never learned anything good from being happy either the way i feel about you has nothing to do with learning it has nothing to do with anything but i feel it down in the corners of my sarcophagus i feel it in my sleep even when i am not thinking about you you are still pouring through my blood like fire through an abandoned hospital ward these coins are getting heavy on my eyes it has been a great honor and privilege to love you it has been a great honor and privilege to eat cold pizza on your steps at dawn love is so stupid it ’ s like punching the sun and having a million gold coins rain down on you which you don ’ t even have to pay tax on because sun money is free money and i ’ m pretty sure there are no laws about that but i would pay tax because i believe that hospitals and education and the arts should be publicly funded even this poem when i look at you my eyes are two identical neighborhood houses on fire when i look at you my eyes bulge out of my skull like a dog in a cartoon when i am with you an enormous silence descends upon me and i feel like i am sinking into the deepest part of my life we walk down the street with the grass blowing back and forth i have never been so happy
for julie if i could tie a river around my love ’ s waist like ribbon make sails out of her blood and pin down death like a squirming bug if i could lift and rock each coffin in my arms i would start with hers
in the road a dog days dead that dog liliana was walking beside me awhile i am sure and i was almost not crying but then found what i was looking for she heaved it for me—all of it the stench the weight— in her thin arms until it was too much tired she dragged the thing by its wasted paws all the way home her dress was stained this is how i learned about love she did not mind at all the silent steady distance i placed between us
then there was the time i looked directly into the face of the life i thought i was missing of love i used to think to be not alone meant never having to walk through the high wheat or struggle in the water not having to decide not to fling from some height once the two of us rode one bicycle i wore a straw hat and perched on the handlebars and beside us the sea oats swayed like skirts and i heard a trilling in the crabgrass the sidewalks were bleached as grecian stone as we rode past the fish shop smelling of morning— salt bread limes men riding in front it was such that i could not be heard always at least not the first time for you pedaled into the wind and my hair was a ribbon in your eyes i said i thought bougainvillea was a stoic plant and then had to say twice no stoic and then no the bougainvillea and then you said easily it was nothing like that at all but our future was clear enough when i asked if you saw the clean aprons of those men how much longer you think until they clean the fish did you see how white those aprons were did you see to which you said how much is it then you think you need
but you made every delicate elegant wrist glistening ankle but you made them beautiful in braided rope dime store gold but you made every necklace clasp but you made them caress the nape like an errant wind after a shower but you made every eyelash erotic every single strand of hair soft but you made them from dust bone made every glorious singing thigh every button nose but you made them with holes— wide open to the faintest hints of salt in a sea breeze salt in the sweaty mouth of a navel salt in the blood sweet in every wrong way
in the hermetic almost dark under the fluorescent dizz i found her broken nerves smoke coming off the dashes the caps like jolts to the neck the pried-open spaces between vowels where the teeth bit off twine and the tongue was raw then cool with ice the air of the stockroom after lunch was the marbleized silence of the small blank pages she stitched into privacy air of paper and faint glue bond carbon graph yellow pads in the stockroom i could read alone— the confetti of money dissolved on the blank wall after work i slid the numbered poems on blue mimeo into my playbook and felt the open field the zig-zagging past cornerbacks the white lines skewed to heaven excuse my mood—unbridled chemical her scrawled messages smooth to the mind excuse my absence again and yes then too— the cold stone of the palisades was there after we split— alone naked in the hudson the water greasing me in the tepid chemical mix before i returned to the cement of 9w in my father ’ s skylark the night black and soundless within
at supper he whispers something in your ear the judas boy who wants you we go to the garden where it ’ s cool and wait from my place against the tree i see you through the window watch as you walk from door to desk reach into your pocket pull out your wallet empty it and leave it by the lamp pick up a pen lean over to write then don ’ t take something heavy from the drawer put it back then sweep the money into a paper bag you walk from desk to door and out your hand reaching back to put out the light on the security film you leave the building alone holding the heavy bag off camera you walk towards the charles leave your saddle shoes under the pedestrian bridge we wait in the garden and wait we don ’ t know yet whom you meet or why we don ’ t know yet that the river has claimed you
en cuba tuve— i ’ m tired of hearing your complaints all that whining about el exilio the tragedy of loss in cuba i had— the catalogue of things the status the riches the opulence of it all i had a mate we were a pair our mistress was young we were young we would dangle on her ear concentrate on what you have forget the past and go out on the town mojitos at la floridita dancing at the tropicana and later no don ’ t tell me about later in the jewel case an aqua tiffany box with white satin interior we tiffany ’ s from new york i didn ’ t know you— would lie together in the pillowy luxury my ruby top layer and his aligned our bases please you needn ’ t— touching my diamond waist and his forming a continuous line sometimes we would switch backs i ’ d push i understand that in communities of exile the population my piercing needle through his back his through mine that ’ s tends to lose ground politically as assimilation takes place that how i liked it best a little harsh but sweet tu y yo you and i is what she called us because our very longing is a constitutive ingredient of not only the condition of exile but— body parts were paired he and i forming a single unit an i and a thou apart surely you have adjusted look you ’ re mounted on a ring you are independent and prized very attractive for your age i might add we are nothing longing doesn ’ t quite— one adapts as to an amputation and la revolución don ’ t make me vomit
wife two was a stripper and sweet as well he traded her in for me to people i do n't know i say she was a dancer i watch them puzzled wonder how anyone could not love a ballerina and you have to question a guy like that trading in a sweet stripper for me not a homemaker not home much at all not sweet more like my grandfather jimmy grieco mean my mother likes to describe the blue-sky day when she bought me a helium balloon and i let it go i was six i begged for another she said okay but if you let this one go i ’ m really going to be mad i nodded took the string in my hand held tight and then opened my hand flat so the balloon lifted and its string slipped up and away you were never sweet my mother says *** in vegas a few weeks ago jimmy and i sorted photographs in his double-wide just off boulder highway my mother stood on the sidelines she hates how i ask jimmy for the hard stories tell me about the moonshine tell me about the dead kids tell me how your mother saved the family by burning down the farm jimmy ’ s crooked finger points to a picture of the family that was leonard he was deaf and dumb died at twelve that was vincent the baby who fell off the staircase without a rail dead at two then there 's his mother surrounded by her children she was tough he says tough when chicago ’ s black hand demanded ten thousand dollars she stuffed five grand in her apron grabbed my grandfather—then five—and took him to deliver the money that 's all you 'll ever get she said and don ’ t touch my kids or i ’ ll kill you *** my grandfather never asks about the first or second wife i don ’ t have to tell him that ballerina-fable he knows i ’ m three and mean he knows it for his whole life his first my grandmother was like sugar he burned her abandoned her in la raced to mexico paved road turning to dirt he ate prickly pear maybe on the way to his quick divorce and though he won ’ t tell this story his own father lived first with a sweet woman on a wheat farm far south in craco italy he boarded a ship told his wife he ’ d send for her and then fled to new york and in an apartment on mulberry street he met up with the new girlfriend and they disappeared into their new world she wasn ’ t pretty she was tough she got busted twice for making moonshine her sons loved her she was mean
to celebrate his final pride in june my friend lymphatic thin and in distress managed to dress in drag he shot the moon outstretched he ’ d used his dying to think—obsess— about the prada pumps their skin a snake the heavy pantyhose two pair the moot but lacy underthings the makeup cake to overlay his pain i called him beaut- i-ful he said he felt like greta garbo in queen christina our campy interplay i countered that he looked more like a hobo- sexual in heels we howled that day we never left his castro flat his rhinestone glittered and everywhere the smell of cologne
accompanied to the campi flegrei by a shadow she listened to voices rise from the darkness then recede instruments sustained them when one had finished others played false proportions sung boldly rain on the roof tiles o selve o campi
the plane is packed and over sweaty heads rumpled hair the movie glows in the transatlantic nighttime murmur of priests and nuns and riverdancers returning home—a baby is cooed by an older mother a boy feels for his seat in the dark i ’ ve read my books already 2 days traveling the difficulties technical i hate that money says the priest beside me and he orders another scotch his third the feast of the epiphany tomorrow he studies religious journals for a message writes in a notebook impossibly small we are having problems with sound the flight attendant announces it is not your headset and so the oceans swell in silence bright blue tumbles across the screen mutely foam collapsing over a tiny nimble figure but she darts through to a green glow sunshine through a veil of wave her surfboard tense between her feet and the world ’ s largest ocean her ride is long impossibly long—her hips stay low a friend drops onto her wave and together they glide towards the shore no music just water and that blue i check the skymall catalogue for something i might need and didn ’ t know there are reasons i am flying over the ocean reasons i i wish i were sure of someday i might say yes i chose him and it wasn ’ t wise or maybe we ’ ll be old and surrounded by our own the screen flashes the surf is wild but the bright sky makes me whisper hawaii where nothing could be that beautiful but is the waves are bigger and she sets out flowered bikini hair pulled back in a serious bun but too soon she ’ s underwater arms above her head spinning down into a champagne sea the priest asks would i like some english chocolate i say no at first then say yes i say how many euros for the scotch the baby jesus is about to be adored by black men foreign kings in fact tomorrow they ’ re stumbling the magi 12 days across an ocean and through the desert it ’ s hot so they must travel at night— who wouldn ’ t and there was that star sudden and perhaps a sign we ’ ve already tried to get there once i want to say to the kings it ’ s cool in this 747 which later the pilot will land with only one engine a problem with compressors but what a sweet sweet ocean and those few younger girls who try to ride it and what a night warmed by the sun-shocked smell of saddle and sweat the strong breath of camels what carved fragrant trunkfuls born across deserts and ready to be opened before an infant god
when the world is reduced to a single dark wood for our two pairs of dazzled eyes—to a beach for two faithful children—to a musical house for our clear understanding—then i shall find you when there is only one old man on earth lonely peaceful handsome living in unsurpassed luxury then i am at your feet when i have realized all your memories —when i am the girl who can tie your hands —then i will stifle you when we are very strong who draws back or very happy who collapses from ridicule when we are very bad what can they do to us dress up dance laugh i will never be able to throw love out of the window —comrade of mine beggar girl monstrous child how little you care about the wretched women and the machinations and my embarrassment join us with your impossible voice oh your voice the one flatterer of this base despair a dark morning in july the taste of ashes in the air the smell of wood sweating in the hearth steeped flowers the devastation of paths drizzle over the canals in the fields why not already playthings and incense i stretched out ropes from spire to spire garlands from window to window golden chains from star to star and i dance the high pond is constantly streaming what witch will rise up against the white sunset what purple flowers are going to descend while public funds disappear in brotherly celebrations a bell of pink are rings in the clouds arousing a pleasant taste of chinese ink a black powder gently rains on my night —i lower the jets of the chandelier throw myself on the bed and turning toward thedark i see you o my daughters and queens
beside a humble stone a tree floats in the cemetery ’ s air not planted in memoriam there but growing wild uncultured free a bird comes perching there to sing winter and summer proffering its faithful song—sad bittersweet that tree that bird are you and i you memory absence me that tide and time record ah by your side to live again undying aye to live again but ma petite now nothingness cold owns my flesh will your love keep my memory fresh
gently let us steep our love in the silence deep as thus branches arching high above twine their shadows over us let us blend our souls as one hearts ’ and senses ’ ecstasies evergreen in unison with the pines ’ vague lethargies dim your eyes and heart at rest freed from all futile endeavor arms crossed on your slumbering breast banish vain desire forever let us yield then you and i to the waftings calm and sweet as their breeze-blown lullaby sways the gold grass at your feet and when night begins to fall from the black oaks darkening in the nightingale ’ s soft call our despair will solemn sing
their long skirts and high heels battled away depending on the ground ’ s and breezes ’ whim at times some stocking shone low on the limb— too soon concealed —tickling our naïveté at times as well an envious bug would bite our lovelies ’ necks beneath the boughs and we would glimpse a flash—white flash ah ecstasy — and glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight evening would fall the autumn day would draw to its uncertain close our belles would cling dreamingly to us cooing whispering lies that still set our souls trembling with awe
your soul is like a landscape fantasy where masks and bergamasks in charming wise strum lutes and dance just a bit sad to be hidden beneath their fanciful disguise singing in minor mode of life ’ s largesse and all-victorious love they yet seem quite reluctant to believe their happiness and their song mingles with the pale moonlight the calm pale moonlight whose sad beauty beaming sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees and makes the marbled fountains gushing streaming— slender jet-fountains—sob their ecstasies
where we could be boys together this region of want the campestrial flat the adolescents roving across the plat come hither he-of-the-hard would call me hither sheer abdomen sheer slickensides the feldspar buttes that mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust and i could kiss his tits and he could destroy me on the inflorescent slopes in his darkest dingles upon the grassland ’ s raffish plaits and he could roll me in coyote brush i who was banished to the barren could come back into his fold and i would let him lay me down on the cold cold ground clouds above lenticular the spreading fundament a glorious breech among the thunderheads and in their midst a great white heron magnifies the day we ’ d keep together he and i and we ’ d gain meaning from our boyage we ’ d pursue each other through the crush of darkling rifts climb into each other ’ s precipitous coombes where would it end this brush and bush this brome and blazing star there is always some new way to flex a limb and find its secret drupe not only the hope of nature the nature of hope so long as culverts carry us so long as we stay ripe to one another ’ s lips and welcoming to hands as long as we extend our spans to tangle them as spinning insects do their glistered floss this is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen rather the trumpet ’ s bell is but a prelude it says we all are beautiful at least once and if you ’ d watch over me we can be beautiful again
for nathan gebert i the chair from goodwill smelled of mildew i sat with sister ann a franciscan in her small office at the cenacle retreat house right off dixie highway in lantana florida i began my story— it was an interview much of life is an interview she said i did not need to pay her but donations yes donations were appreciated they could be left anonymously in a plain white envelope that she could take back to the cloister she was dressed in a turtleneck and a denim jumper she could have been mistaken in a grocery store for an aging housewife my meetings with her went on for a few years i had come to speak about durell i did not know how to end sentences about durell he had taught me—what to live not to wince in the mirror what there were so many ways to end my sentence he was an unlikely candidate for so many things outside it was always some subtle variation of summer i paused then spoke urgently not wanting to forget some fact but much i knew i would forget or remember in a way my own which would not exactly be correct no not exactly durell was dead i said and i needed to make sense of things sister ann ’ s face was open fragile— parts were chipped like on a recovered fresco above her gray head a garish postcard of the emmaus scene the colors off as if painted by numbers with no concern for shading— the style of it had an unoriginal catholic institutional uniformity there it hung askew in its golden drugstore frame it was the scene from the end of luke the two disciples one named cleopas the other anonymous forever mumbling christ ’ s name and with them the resurrected christ masquerading as a stranger they were on their way to that town emmaus seven miles out from jerusalem gossiping about the impress of christ ’ s vanishing— they argued about whether to believe what they had seen they were restless back and forth the debate went— when there is estrangement there is little peace ii every time we met sister ann prayed first at times my recollections blurred or a presumption would reverse sister ann told me durell was with me still in a more intimate way than when he lived she frequently lost her equilibrium as older people sometimes do before settling into her worn-out chair where she listened to me week after week the day i met durell i said the morning light was clear startling the town with ornament the steeple of christ church held the horizon in place or so i imagined as if it had been painted first with confident amounts of titanium white before the rest was added trees clattered the reiterating brick puzzle of cambridge brightened— mass avenue mount auburn dunster holyoke— proclaimed a new september and new students trudged the streets every blood-warm structure was defined in relief hours before while the moon ’ s neck wobbled on the charles like a giraffe ’ s or the ghost of a giraffe ’ s neck i imagined durell labored having slept only a few hours caged in his worries of doctor bills no money and running out of people to ask for it mulling over mistakes broken love affairs— a hospital orderly a man upstairs he probably mumbled unkind epithets about blacks and jews even though the men he loved were blacks and jews some of his blasphemies if you want to call them that embarrassed me in front of sister ann but she seemed unflappably tolerant at sixty he was unemployable he had taught school and guarded buildings each job ending worse than the last his refrain was always “ it is not easy being an impoverished aristocrat. ” he spoke with the old harvard accent i can still hear it i will probably always hear it with new york city the north shore and the army mixed in the a ’ s broadened the r ’ s were flat the t ’ s snapped— so a sentence would calibrate to a confident close like “ my dee-ah boy that is that. ” he lived on 19 garden street in a rent-controlled studio on the second floor number 25 he said the “ 25 ” reminded him of christmas at eleven o ’ clock he probably pulled on his support hose increasing the circulation in his legs blotched green and black next he would have locked the door with his gold key and moved deliberately his smile beleaguered bowing to miss littlefield in the landlord ’ s office at the building ’ s dark cubbyhole of an entrance they probably spoke of queen elizabeth ii her disappointments for miss littlefield and he were royalists both then durell began to move towards me entering the square breathing heavily he might have passed the brattle advertising judgment at nuremberg— inside the shut black theatrical box where the world repeated the past maximilian schell interrogated judy garland and montgomery clift marlene dietrich let the phone ring and ring maybe he passed the store 24 sign bright orange passed nini ’ s corner where sex magazines were stacked like a cliff maybe maybe but maybe not maybe he went another way then i recalled how the t shook that place the subway grates pushing up the scent of rat-life and all things fallen mixing with leavitt peirce exuding its masculine snuff down plympton street he might have gone past the grolier which i always remembered for some reason as closed gilded with spines of poetry books for its reredos yes he probably most likely certainly did that sister ann wondered if i thought he paused i thought not— poetry offered him no solutions at twelve o ’ clock the chairperson called our aa meeting to order we called ourselves “ the loony nooners ” and met in a lutheran church basement we ate salads out of tupperware shaking the contents like dice to mix the dressing some knitted schizophrenics lit multiple cigarettes acne-pocked kate wanted to be a model electroshock mike read paperbacks and an irish professor named tom welcomed tellus who could not get over nam darkened figures in the poor light we looked like the burghers of calais and smelled of brewed coffee smoke perfume urine human brine we were aristocrats of time “ i have twenty-one years ” “ i have one week ” “ i have one day. ” i have often thought we were like first-century christians— a strident hidden throng electrified by a message or another way of thinking of us is that we were inconvenient obstacles momentarily removed much to the city ’ s relief from each window well high heels and business shoes hurried durell h. as he was known to us took his place his thick hair fixed as the waves of an 1800s nautical painting perhaps he kept it set with hair spray his tiffany ring polished to a brilliance he set himself apart in his metal folding chair he had the clotted girth of hermann göring what was he thinking about was he thinking about blood clots and possible aneurysms imperious behind prism-like trifocals quietly he said to me “ i ’ ve grown as fat as elizabeth taylor. ” iii the meeting ended and durell folded his metal chair he hated his christian name— “ durell ” he said “ who names their child durell ” moving among the crowd listening to success and failure he passed out meeting lists literature leaflets durell sponsored men he referred to them as “ pigeons. ” i met him that day i was his last after that every day we spoke on rotary phones i was young and spoke as if my story was the only one i told him i had underlined key passages in plato ’ s symposium told him i had been graded unfairly on dante ’ s inferno and purgatorio told him my schedule might not allow for the paradiso he matched my telling with listening advising and more listening mostly over the phone and the more he listened the more he was alone “ why was that ” sister ann asked it was some sort of offering perhaps at times it seemed he needed to guarantee a pardon that old catholic idea of indulgences lurked somewhere there unspoken as if he believed a larger offering might guarantee a larger pardon such a task demanded his increased singleness yes that was true or was it i had trouble settling on the right words with sister ann many of my words were not exactly right the syntax awkward i kept having trouble translating durell so much i guessed how to know why hadn ’ t i asked him more questions he wasn ’ t the sort that invited questions i do remember that another way of saying it was that when he was with me on the phone then and only then did he seem to move in truth and in his truths reprimanding and hard he was made more singular maybe that was it whatever the case he listened he listened to me i missed his listening listening sister ann said is a memorable form of love after the meeting he gave me his calling card the cards were placed inside his compulsively polished silver card case the black capitals raised on their ecru background containing his name bracketed by a “ mr. ” and a “ jr. ” — the “ mr. ” denoting lost civility the “ jr. ” tallying a lineage that did not bridge as we walked down church street the bells of st. john the evangelist rang the road was bright the road full behind the brown gate with the thick black rusted latch the monks sang “ it is well it is well with my soul with my soul. ” we peered in at bookshop clerks locating titles watch repairmen bent over lit ocular devices fixing movements florists hands wet arranging stems and branches broken we saw ourselves reflected i laughed with deference the way a student laughs before a teacher his skin was flecked with milk-blues lead-whites earthen reds in dress and demeanor he was as rigid as a toy soldier for he was a part of a republic with standards atrophied devoted to order everyone found him impossible including at times me of queers his word for what he was but could not admit to he said “ you know in the army they could never be trusted. ” i mentioned romantic love in profile a silhouette he paused he said “ it has been very vexing indeed. ” by his tone i knew never to ask again a decorum of opprobrium kept him whole and so he guarded himself with intensity maybe sister ann suggested he was guarding me durell said “ i ’ ve whittled my world down to no one spencer with the possible exception of you. ” iv “ what happened then ” sister ann asked he excused himself with a handshake his palms soft as bread dough from all the jergens he had slathered on and then he probably returned to his ambry of a studio a place where i would be one of his only visitors although he handed out his number he did not always answer i remember ... what do i remember ... i was free to turn away but the moment i looked back durell would come back to me waiting for me it seems to me now after all this time few things have as much fidelity as the past i remember he had nailed memorabilia above his head as one would place stones to fortify a castle a photograph of him in the army liberating people undoing russian codes a framed marriage license from england although the marriage failed he often mumbled her name his framed diploma harvard and over the corner hung his graduation cap ’ s faded black tassel next to his pill bottles an edward viii coronation mug he doted on commemorating an event that never took place maybe he made a bread and baloney sandwich maybe he stepped over the rolled-up tag-sale carpet and drew the shades by late evening he might have jotted down notes about god obedient as he was to the twelve steps of aa he might have written in his tightly-looped feminine penmanship informed by the palmer method and later repeated a phrase or two to me over the phone or maybe he read from his twenty-four hours a day book to find a rule maybe or to search for a sanctuary or maybe he listened to the reverend peter gomes on the radio the plummer professor of christian morals at harvard for he often mentioned how he loved the preacher ’ s parallel constructions yes maybe he did that maybe possibly he did that and then perhaps he slept a bit before the whole routine began once more with the support hose the hair spray miss littlefield the sex magazines the grolier the folding chair the meeting the calling card how crazy america was he said how he wanted to leave but he never left town except jolting trips to the hospital in an ambulance down all those brick roads v i lived in cambridge two years after that wherever i moved we spoke daily over the phone on landlines — talking and listening listening and talking for fifteen years “ you alright ” “ yes you ” in all that time i saw him only once more and by then he was nearly blind in all that time we barely touched one another why our relationship required its rood screen i could not fully explain to sister ann indeed i can never seem to properly explain it to anyone but i have tried and i will probably always keep trying but if i get nothing right i must try to get a nuance of our friendship and his sponsorship right— we were bound bound by a vow a vow of attention there are many causes for attention among them redemption our attention concerned the spirit although that sounds pious and we were not so pious we were more selfish more human than pious what else can i say i needed a liberator and liberators can come in some unexpected guises i may never wholly explain the two of us perhaps the spirit defies the human mind even after all my time with sister ann finally from a hospital came the report of durell ’ s last day a charge nurse said “ i touched the gangrene leg pink flesh was coming back. ” his compliments had increased the more his life failed in the final week he quoted cole porter songs to me— you ’ re a bendel bonnet a shakespeare sonnet you ’ re mickey mouse ... i did not repeat the rhymes to sister ann who durell was and why he did what he did and why he hid what he hid i kept asking her sister ann quoted from deuteronomy “ i set before you life and death ... choose life. ” old pigeon flying back when i arrived at the hospital his body was gone the formalities were few for he had become a ward of the state the staff gave me a brown grocery bag of his things a roll of dimes a pair of shoes a belt buckle an einstein quote something about mediocre minds afterwards i went through cambridge and found the meeting gone night was coming blindness worked on the people shops churches streets no one knew me people said “ where will we go ” and “ what will we eat ” i thought i recognized this or that face but no no too much time had passed on church street restaurants had replaced bookstores windows on mass avenue shone with chandeliers someone backed up photographing with a flash “ hold still ” they said “ hold still. ” a new set of homeless people pleaded coins rattled inside the used coffee cups they shook everyone moved with packages briefcases textbooks flash cards cell phones flowers the charles advanced determined as a hearse its dark waters gathering up every unattached thing an umber granular dusk-light fell on the elms over harvard yard as they swayed dark and slow like the chords in the waltz from copeland ’ s rodeo there i stood unsure of which way to go the light had more ghosts in it as it must have had that day in emmaus vi suddenly sister ann announced our last meeting down the linoleum hallway sister katherine and sister ruth moved and prayed their numbers had dropped from seven to six and the nuns decided the retreat house would close soon the chapel and offices would be leveled and replaced with condominiums in the halls the swoosh-snap of duct tape yanked pulled and cut straps tightened vans bleating and backing up into the back weather reports exchanged with the movers sister ann told me about herself that final time parents dead alcoholic brother dead the brother embarrassed she had been a nun she opened her bible on the shipping box between us leaned in her hearing aids on her silver crucifix knocking on her chest above her head a nail where the emmaus scene had hung i asked “ what caused him to remain ” why did he want freedom for me sister ann spoke then of the gospel of john and the samaritan woman at the well the one married nearly as many times as elizabeth taylor and how when christ listened to her she became the first evangelist it was christ ’ s longest conversation with anyone sister ann said the samaritan woman ’ s life changed because christ listened to her john k. from the meetings dead now too once said “ oh i knew durell he was odd but we ’ re all odd you know. ” all i know now is the more he loved me the more i loved the world vii i lost track of sister ann i have often thought about her and all the time she spent with me i have wanted to tell her now for some time that not long after the cloister closed durell ’ s sister located me leaving a message on my answering machine it was still the time of answering machines inviting me to her winter house in boynton beach durell ’ s sister gave me directions she was quite close to me as it turned out she had some of durell ’ s belongings that she wanted me to have “ there isn ’ t much ” she said “ but still i think you should have what ’ s here. ” durell spoke of his sister often but i did not know his family however when we met we recognized each other as one sometimes recognizes what one has never seen before i said to her “ he knew me better than anyone. ” the sentence surprised us we sat by the pool in her gated country club the florida evening was a watercolor in the making colors bleeding into striking mistakes after all the members withdrew she said “ there are many things you do not know about my brother. ” a worker folded terry cloth towels under a bamboo hut her voice halted as voices halt when words have been withheld “ they called him names ” she said “ a nancy boy a priss a sissy a fairy ... ” the pool ’ s tempos ceased until the silence about us was the silence in a palace light disappeared everywhere the sun fell she looked away said that he ’ d been to the army language school learned german and russian played the organ in his spare time mentioned he ’ d taken music with copland at harvard he had received a “ gentleman ’ s ‘ c ’ ” — the “ c ” stood for copland she said he always said— which made us laugh and seemed to beckon him to us he had hoped for an army career she went on and then she mumbled something about a little german town i think she said it was in schleswig-holstein near lübeck where he was stationed while borders were being redrawn the letters stopping the army the men something the drink ... and then her words fell and sank into subtle variations of all that goes unsaid we heard the distant sound of a train on its track crossing the florida map going brown then black he became difficult isolated— she spoke softly then like the penitent he was always asking for money as his requests persisted she began to screen her calls “ it became easier to tell him i had not been home ” she said his behavior was affecting her marriage she chose never to introduce her children to durell perhaps he had a mental illness perhaps he invented— perhaps perhaps perhaps— but no she pressed on perhaps it was his sexuality he was too sensitive ... “ people can be cruel ” she said she felt he had never adjusted to cruelty as if cruelty was something that one needed to adjust to later he was picked up for charges of soliciting sex and the more she told me the less i knew all about us a stillness began to displace the light and durell was there and no longer there staining that stillness after an estrangement ends there comes a great stillness the greater the estrangement the greater the stillness across the parking lot a gate rattled i told her he often said his life had been a failure i tried to convince him otherwise but he never believed me half a century ago she broke off contact her protracted estrangement made her look ill. “ please please ” she said her voice trailed off although what she was pleading for was not clear no no she did not want her grandchildren to know subtle variations of florida evening light withdrew with finality the pool brightened with moonlight the color of snow the pool was still there we were a man and a woman sitting in cushioned lounge chairs as if the world would always be an endless pair of separated things we did not touch each other we were still a long time
for jackson allen my friend wears my scarf at his waist i give him moonstones he gives me shell seaweeds he comes from a distant city i meet him we will plant eggplants celery together he weaves me cloth many have brought the gifts i use for his pleasure silk green hills heron the color of dawn my friend walks soft as a weaving on the wind he backlights my dreams he has built altars beside my bed i awake in the smell of his hair can not remember his name or my own
you are my bread and the hairline noise of my bones you are almost the sea you are not stone or molten sound i think you have no hands this kind of bird flies backward and this love breaks on a windowpane where no light talks this is not time for crossing tongues the sand here never shifts i think tomorrow turned you with his toe and you will shine and shine unspent and underground
at once this dragnet of cousins whips its way into your presence saying none of them among us they are oracles on the court of midnight the tight filigree of a mind or your splashing around in your pandemonium of copper graffiti inexpertly put up they make weapons of furled hands “ we will walk but our bones will carry ribbons of lead or we will like acrobats mill-headed in 3s 3 blades 3 hips 3 tongues answer to what comes before what comes before ” eleousa master of dark eyelids eye opening like a fennel seed you are generous or are you not do you shore up and wink at the soul what does the soul say other than “ my divorce from ” “ tan holiday ” “ smoking crystal in teak rooms ” but should have asked “ what do you see ” the sun a sequence of fans a bridge only so exquisitely cabled as to make us still—shall we fall or travel between bridges among the robust sane clouds a face cut from smoke heat and light the sun dancing in a vial the initial memory of what it was to be born— doberman of a sheer-white universe— to school out—the audacity of rising without name or color to new rooms new youth fruitful born singularly to precise moments not in epiphany but duration—as under new weather we become—in action receive—our bodies uncasked like umbrellas under the flamingo-red light of the racing day
the grasses are light brown and the ocean comes in long shimmering lines under the fleet from last night which dozes now in the early morning here and there horses graze on somebody ’ s acreage strangely it was not my desire that bade me speak in church to be released but memory of the way it used to be in careless and exotic play when characters were promises then recognitions the world of transformation is real and not real but trusting enough of these lessons i mean didactic phrases to take you in and out of love ’ s mysterious bonds well i myself am not myself and which power of survival i speak for is not made of houses it is inner luxury of golden figures that breathe like mountains do and whose skin is made dusky by stars
yesterday afternoon i hung a framed print in the living room— a task that took two head-throbbing hours it ’ s a wedding portrait that we love frida and diego rivera i wonder how two people could consistently hurt each other but still feel love so deeply as their bones turned into dust before frida died she painted a watermelon still life before his death diego did too i want to believe that those paintings were composed during parallel moments because of their undying devotion if i close my eyes i can see melon wedges left like centerpieces except for the slice diego put on the table ’ s corner— one piece of fruit pecked at by a dove that passed through a window i know that i won ’ t be building a bookshelf anytime soon and that the chances of me constructing a roll-top desk are as slim as me building an adirondack chair that sits plumb but i ’ m good with the spackle and putty knives in my tool belt the knots in my back might not be there if i had listened to her suggestions and i could well have done without two hours of silence over a few holes in the wall but somehow life has its ways of working things out this afternoon i shut the blinds turned off the tv lights and phone and massaged my wife ’ s feet to fight off a migraine— her second one this week despite the prophylactics and pain killers that we store in the breadbox for once i ’ d like to experience what she feels nausea blindness and pain that strike when the cranial vessels dilate fill with blood leak and make the brain swell earlier an mri triggered the reaction as it mapped her head with electrical current gradient magnets and radio waves hammering her floundering eyes for now we have our room the bed frame and the mattress where she lies as i knead her toes come nightfall i hope that we ’ ll sit in the patio and watch the breeze stirring the lemon lime and orange trees that i planted along the back fence on certain nights the moon turns our lawn into green acrylic where we sip syrah and mint tea until all we know is the sound of our breathing among the whispering leaves
the work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty chiefly because i can not concentrate i have no feeling about whether what i am writing is good or bad and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me and i am sure i know the reason it ’ s that i can ’ t stand leaving unresolved my situation with pat i hear from her fairly frequently asking when i plan to come back and she knows that i am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of january it is not mainly loneliness i feel though i feel it but i have been lonely before it is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us and that in the mean time i worry about how things are going to work out this has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before – from a letter to his parents dated november 9 1955 rome hardly enough for me that the pail of water alive with the wrinkling light brings clearness home and whiter than mind conceives the walls mature to white or that the washed tomatoes whose name is given to love fulfill their bowl and the roman sea is woven together by threading fish and made most whole i delight in each of these delight moreover in the dark skill of those hands closer to wise than clever of our blind italian landlady who stands her shoes fouled with the lustful blood of rabbit lightly dispatched and dressed fixing it to the gibbet of the clothesline where the laundry sails to rest these textures solicit of us our instant homage but are disparate senseless things unless a reigning image bring them to purpose as your presence brings the world in offering like a chaplet worn in aphrodite ’ s name the furious unicorn come to the virgin ’ s lap tethered and tame and thus it is as you stand in this morning ’ s shadows where ancient chamber pots are grown to little meadows of mint and parsley surely it ’ s love unknots the winds for ulysses and recalls to man a summer without cease sprung from the same dishpan onion and lily work their primal peace
when you show yourself to the woman you love you don ’ t know your fear is not fear itself you have never been good but now you are so good who are you is it the liquidity of her skin that bathes the world for you or her face captured like a she-lion in your own flesh this summerbed is soft with ring upon ring upon ring of wedding the kind that doesn ’ t clink upon contact the kind with no contract the kind in which the gold is only only light cloud covers and lifts and sleep and night and soon enough love ’ s big fire laughs at a terrible burn but only only because pain absorbs excess joy and you shouldn ’ t flaunt your treasures in front of all day ’ s eyes
“ dark and amusing he is this handsome gallant of chamois-polished charm athlete and dancer of uncommon talent— is there cause for alarm in his smooth demeanor the proud tilt of his chin this cavaliere servente this harlequin “ gentle and kindly this other ardent but shy with an intelligence who would not glory to be guided by— and would it not make sense to trust in someone so devoted so worshipful as this tender pale pierrot “ since both of them delight if i must choose i win a matchless mate but by that very winning choice i lose— i pause i hesitate putting decision off ” says columbine “ and while i hesitate they both are mine ”
when we talk about when to tell the kids we are so together so concentrated i mutter “ i feel like a killer. ” “ i ’ m the killer ” —taking my wrist—he says holding it he is sitting on the couch the old indigo chintz around him rich as a night sea with jellies i am sitting on the floor i look up at him as if within some chamber of matedness some dust i carry around me tonight to breathe its magellanic field is less painful maybe because he is drinking a wine grown where i was born—fog eucalyptus sempervirens—and i ’ m sharing the glass with him “ don ’ t catch my cold ” he says “ —oh that ’ s right you want to catch my cold. ” i should not have told him that i tell him i will try to fall out of love with him but i feel i will love him all my life he says he loves me as the mother of our children and new troupes of tears mount to the acrobat platforms of my ducts and do their burning leaps some of them jump straight sideways and for a moment i imagine a flurry of tears like a whirra of knives thrown at a figure to outline it—a heart ’ s spurt of rage it glitters in my vision i nod to it it is my hope

my dear your eyes are weary rest them a little while assume the languid posture of pleasure mixed with guile outside the talkative fountain continues night and day repeating my warm passion in whatever it has to say the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebe ’ s very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears thus your soul ignited by pleasure ’ s lusts and needs sprays into heaven ’ s reaches and dreams of fiery deeds then it brims over dying and languorous apart drains down some slope and enters the dark well of my heart the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebe ’ s very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears o you whom night enhances how sweet here at your breasts to hear the eternal sadness of water that never rests o moon o singing fountain o leaf-thronged night above you are the faultless mirrors of my sweet bitter love the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebe ’ s very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears
i it ’ s odd to have a separate month it escapes the year it is not only cold it is warm and loving like a death grip on a willing knee the indians have a name for it they call it “ summer ” the tepees shake in the blast like roosters at dawn everything is special to them the colorful ones ii somehow the housewife does not seem gentle is she angry because her husband likes october is it snow bleeds softly from her shoes the nest eggs have captured her but april rises from her bed iii “ the beggars are upon us ” cried chester three strangers appeared at the door demanding ribbons the october wind nests iv why do i think october is beautiful it is not is not beautiful but then what is there to hold one ’ s interest between the various drifts of a day ’ s work but to search out the differences the window and grate— but it is not is not beautiful v i think your face is beautiful the way it is close to my face and i think you are the real october with your transparence and the stone of your words as they pass as i do not hear them
side by side through the streets at midnight roaming together through the tumultuous night of london in the miraculous april weather roaming together under the gaslight day ’ s work over how the spring calls to us here in the city calls to the heart from the heart of a lover cool to the wind blows fresh in our faces cleansing entrancing after the heat and the fumes and the footlights where you dance and i watch your dancing good it is to be here together good to be roaming even in london even at midnight lover-like in a lover ’ s gloaming you the dancer and i the dreamer children together wandering lost in the night of london in the miraculous april weather
loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show that she dear she might take some pleasure of my pain pleasure might cause her read reading might make her know knowledge might pity win and pity grace obtain — i sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe studying inventions fine her wits to entertain oft turning others ’ leaves to see if thence would flow some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain but words came halting forth wanting invention ’ s stay invention nature ’ s child fled step-dame study ’ s blows and others ’ feet still seemed but strangers in my way thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes biting my truant pen beating myself for spite “ fool ” said my muse to me “ look in thy heart and write ”
the sorrow of true love is a great sorrow and true love parting blackens a bright morrow yet almost they equal joys since their despair is but hope blinded by its tears and clear above the storm the heavens wait to be seen but greater sorrow from less love has been that can mistake lack of despair for hope and knows not tempest and the perfect scope of summer but a frozen drizzle perpetual of drops that from remorse and pity fall and can not ever shine in the sun or thaw removed eternally from the sun ’ s law
i drove to oak park took two tours and looked at some of the houses i took the long way back along the lake the place that i came home to—a cavernous apartment on the east side of milwaukee— seems basically a part of that tradition with the same admixture of expansion and restraint the space takes off yet leaves behind a nagging feeling of confinement with the disconcerting sense that while the superficial conflicts got resolved the underlying tensions brought to equilibrium it isn ’ t yet a place in which i feel that i can live imagine someone reading contemplate a man oblivious to his settings and then a distant person standing in an ordinary room hemmed in by limitations yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life that blooms within its own mysterious enclosure in a solitary space in which the soul can breathe and where the heart can stay—not by discovering it but by creating it by giving it a self-sustaining atmosphere of depth both in the architecture and in the unconstructed life that it contains in a late and very brief remark freud speculates that space is the projection of a “ psychic apparatus ” which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself and wright extols “ that primitive sense of shelter ” which can turn a house into a refuge from despair i wish that time could bring the future back again and let me see things as they used to seem to me before i found myself alone in an emancipated state— alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow there used to be a logic in the way time passed that made it flow directly towards an underlying space where all the minor individual lives converged the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past and bathed the future in a soft familiar light i remembered from home and which has faded and the voices get supplanted by the rain the nights seem colder and the angel in the mind that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air while in its place a kind of monument appears magnificent in isolation compromised by proximity and standing in a small and singular expanse— as though the years had been a pretext for reflection and my life had been a phase of disenchantment— as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw the reassuring settings slowly melt away and what remains is just a sense of getting older in a variation of the parable the pure of heart descend into a kingdom that they never wanted and refused to see the homely notions of the good the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like adolescent fictions as the real forms of life deteriorate with manically increasing speed the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter and the serenity it brings—not in reflection but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken of losing everything of acquiescing in the obvious approach the house shaped like a box the life that can ’ t accommodate another ’ s — as the heart shrinks down to tiny local things why can ’ t the more expansive ecstasies come true i met you more than thirty years ago in 1958 in mrs. wolford ’ s eighth grade history class all moments weigh the same and matter equally yet those that time brings back create the fables of a happy or unsatisfying life of minutes passing on the way to either peace or disappointment— like a paper calendar on which it ’ s always autumn and we ’ re back in school again or a hazy afternoon near the beginning of october with the world series playing quietly on the radio and the windows open and the california sunlight filling up the room when i survey the mural stretched across the years —across my heart—i notice mostly small neglected parts of no importance to the whole design but which in their obscurity seem more permanent and real i see the desks and auditorium suffused with yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that still remains there in a space pervaded by a soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate— as though the future weren ’ t real and the present were amorphous with nothing to hold on to and the past were there forever and the art that time inflicts upon its subjects can ’ t eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood which harden into shapes as it recedes i wish i knew a way of looking at the world that didn ’ t find it wanting or of looking at my life that didn ’ t always see a half-completed structure made of years and filled with images and gestures emblematic of the past like gatsby ’ s light or proust ’ s imbalance on the stones i wish there were a place where i could stay and leave the world alone—an enormous stadium where i could wander back and forth across a field replete with all the incidents and small details that gave the days their textures that bound the minutes into something solid and that linked them all together in a way that used to seem eternal we used to go to dances in my family ’ s ancient cadillac which blew up late one summer evening climbing up the hill outside del mar and later i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles ’ baby-butcher album at your house in mission bay and three years later listening to the velvet underground performing in a roller skating rink years aren ’ t texts or anything like texts and yet i often think of 1968 that way as though that single year contained the rhythms of the rest as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in intractable confusion as the wedding turned into a puzzling fiasco over poor john godfrey ’ s hair the parts were real and yet the dense and living whole they once composed seems broken now its voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me more distantly each day until the tangled years are finally drained of feeling and collapse into a sequence of the places where we lived your parents ’ house in kensington and mine above the canyon then the flat by sears in cambridge where we moved when we got married and the third floor of the house on francis avenue near harvard square the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the year that john was born and last of all the house in whitefish bay where you live now and all those years came inexplicably undone in mid-july the sequence ended late last year suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world as it exists for one then half of mine has ended while the fragment which has recently come to be contains no vantage point from which to see it whole i think that people are the sum of their illusions that the cares that make them difficult to see are eased by distance with their errors blending in an intricate harmony their truths abiding in a subtle “ spark ” or psyche each incomparable yet each the same as all the others and their disparate careers all joined together in a tangled moral vision whose intense meandering design seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling as in grief or in the pathos of a life cut off by loneliness indifference or hate because the most important thing is human happiness— not in the sense of private satisfactions but of lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real the whole transcends its tensions like the intimate reflections on the day that came at evening whose significance was usually overlooked or misunderstood because the facts were almost always unexceptional two years ago we took our son to paris last night i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show and then took him home i look at all the houses as i walk down hackett avenue to work i teach my classes visit friends cook introspective meals for myself yet in the end the minutes don ’ t add up what ’ s lost is the perception of the world as something good and held in common as a place to be perfected in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters that endowed it with integrity and structure and that merged its private moments with the past what broke it into pieces what transformed the flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and smoldering resentment—like coming home too early or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob i wish that life could be a window on the sun instead of just this porch where i can stand and contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution the guggenheim museum just reopened tonight i watched a segment of the news on pbs—narrated by a woman we met years ago at bob ’ s—that showed how most of wright ’ s interior had been restored and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky i like the houses better—they flow in all directions merging with the scenery and embodying a milder more domestic notion of perfection on a human scale that doesn ’ t overwhelm the life that it encloses isn ’ t there a way to feel at home within the confines of this bland accommodating structure made of souvenirs and emblems like the hammock hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished prairie school house in whitefish bay—the lineal reduced descendant of the “ flameproof ” wright house just a block or two away from where i live now i usually walk along the street on sunday musing on how beautiful it seems how aspects of it recapitulate the oak park house and studio with open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior and with the entrance half-concealed on the side— a characteristic feature of his plans that made it difficult to find although the hope was that in trying to get inside the visitor ’ s eye would come to linger over subtleties he might have failed to see— in much the way that in the course of getting older and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here i found myself pulled backwards through these old uncertain passages distracted by the details and meeting only barriers to understanding why the years unfolded as they did and why my life turned out the way it has—like his signature “ pathway of discovery ” with each diversion adding to the integrity of the whole there is this sweep life has that makes the accidents of time and place seem small everything alters and the personal concerns that love could hold together for a little while decay and then the world seems strange again and meaningless and free i miss the primitive confusions and the secret way things came to me each evening and the pain i still wonder where the tears went standing in my room each day and quietly inhabiting a calm suspended state enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me with the background noise cascading out of nothing like a song that makes the days go by a song incorporating everything—not into what it says but simply in the way it touches me a single image of dispersal the inexhaustible perception of contingency and transience and isolation it brings them back to me i have the inwardness i think i must have wanted and the quietude the solitary temper and this space where i can linger with the silence curling all around me like the sound of pure passage waiting here surrounded by the furniture the books and lists and all these other emblems of the floating world the prints of raindrops that begin as mist that fall discreetly through the atmosphere and disappear and then i feel them in the air in a reserved more earthly music filled with voices reassembling in a wellspring of remembrance talking to me again and finding shelter in the same evasive movements i can feel in my own life cloaked in a quiet dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old and fading out of other people ’ s consciousness and dying –with its deepest insecurities and fears concealed by their own protective colorations as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home it has the texture of an uncreated substance hovering between the settings it had come to love and some unformulated state i can ’ t imagine— waiting for the telephone to ring obsessed with ways to occupy these wide unstructured hours and playing records by myself and waking up alone all things are disparate yet subject to the same intense eradicating wills of time and personality like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build between our lives and emptiness the certainty they seemed to have just two or three short years ago before the anger spread its poison over everything i think about the way our visions locked together in a nightmare play of nervousness and language living day to day inside the concentrated force of that relentless argument whose words swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety two people clinging to their versions of their lives almost like children—living out each other ’ s intermittent fantasies that fed upon themselves as though infected by some vile concentrated hatred who then woke up and planned that evening ’ s dinner it ’ s all memories now and distance miles away the cat is sleeping on the driveway john ’ s in school and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen nothing really changes—the external world intrudes and then withdraws and then becomes continuous again i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant lanterns made of opalescent art glass—part i guess of what this morning ’ s paper called the “ wright craze. ” i like the easy way the days go by the parts of aging that have come to seem familiar and the uneventful calm that seems to settle on the house at night each morning brings the mirror ’ s reassuring face as though the years had left the same enduring person simplified and changed—no longer vaguely desperate no longer torn yet still impatient with himself and still restless but drained of intricacy and rage like a mild paradox—uninteresting in its own right yet existing for the sake of something stranger now and then our life comes over me in brief involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom unexpectedly in fleeting moments of regret that come before the ache the pang that gathers sharply like an indrawn breath—a strange and thoughtful kind of pain as though a steel band had somehow snapped inside my heart i don ’ t know but what i do know is that none of it is ever going to come to me again why did i think a person only distantly like me might finally represent my life what aspects of my attitudes my cast of mind my inconclusive way of tossing questions at the world had i supposed might realize another person ’ s fantasies and turn her into someone else—who gradually became a separate part of me and argued with the very words i would have used and looked at me through eyes i ’ d looked at as though gazing at myself i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining all the charms that contemplation holds—until the long enchantment of the soul with what it sees is lifted and it startles at a space alight with objects of its infantile gaze like people in a mall i saw her just the other day i felt a kind of comfort at her face one tinctured with bemusement at the strange and guarded person she ’ d become— attractive vaguely friendly brisk too brisk but no one i could think might represent my life why did i even try to see myself in what ’ s outside the strangeness pushes it away propels the vision back upon itself into these regions filled with shapes that i can wander through and never see as though their image were inherently unreal the houses on a street the quiet backyard shade the room restored to life with bric-a-brac— i started by revisiting these things then slowly reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible that balanced sympathy and space inside an abstract edifice combining reaches of the past with all these speculations all this artful preening of the heart i sit here at my desk perplexed and puzzled teasing out a tangled skein of years we wove together and trying to combine the fragments of those years into a poem who cares if life—if someone ’ s actual life—is finally insignificant and small there ’ s still a splendor in the way it flowers once and fades and leaves a carapace behind there isn ’ t time to linger over why it happened or attempt to make its mystery come to life again and last like someone still embracing the confused perceptions of himself embedded in the past as though eternity lay there— for heaven ’ s a delusion and eternity is in the details and this tiny insubstantial life is all there is —and that would be enough but for the reoccurring dreams i often have of you sometimes at night the banished unrealities return as though a room suffused with light and poetry took shape around me pictures line the walls it ’ s early summer somewhere in remembrance of things past marcel reflecting on his years with “ albertine ” —with x— suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance of the separation of two lives in time and space i think the same estrangement ’ s mirrored in each life in how it seems both adequate and incomplete—part day-to-day existence part imaginary construct beckoning at night and sighing through my dreams like some disconsolate chimera or the subject of a lonely terrifying sadness or the isolation of a quiet winter evening when the house feels empty and silence intervenes but in the wonderful enclosure opening in my heart i seem to recognize our voices lilting in the yard inflected by the rhythms of a song whose words are seamless and whose lines are never-ending i can almost see the contours of your face and sense the presence of the trees and reimagine all of us together in a deep abiding happiness as if the three of us inhabited a fragile made-up world that seemed to be so permanent so real i have this fantasy it ’ s early in the evening you and i are sitting in the backyard talking friends arrive then drinks and dinner conversation… the lovely summer twilight lasts forever… what ’ s the use what purpose do these speculations serve what mild enchantments do these meditations leave they ’ re just the murmurs of an age of middle age that help to pass the time that they retrieve before subsiding leaving everything unchanged each of us at times has felt the future fade or seen the compass of his life diminished or realized some tangible illusion was unreal driving down to evanston last week i suddenly remembered driving down that road eight years ago so caught up in some story i ’ d just finished that i ’ d missed the way the countryside was changing— how in place of trees there now were office towers and theme parks parts of a confusingly panoply of barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape filled with high receding clouds and rows of flimsy houses in what used to be a field i thought of other people ’ s lives and how impossible it seemed to grasp them on the model of my own—as little mirrors of infinity—or sense their forms of happiness or in their minor personal upheavals feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale and see its abstract argument made visible i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude— how life lacks shape until it ’ s given one by love and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself and part of some incorporating whole that feels and has a face and lets it live forever all of these seemed true and cancelled one another leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence tracing out the contours of a world erased like music tracing out the contours of the mind— for life has the form of a winding curve in space and in its wake the human figure disappears look at our surroundings—where a previous age could visualize a landscape we see borders yet i think the underlying vision is the same a person positing a world that he can see and can ’ t contain and vexed by other people everything is possible some of it seemed real or nearly real yet in the end it spoke to me alone in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager ledge above a waterfall or rolling across a vast expanding plain on which there ’ s always room but only room for one it starts and ends inside an ordinary room while in the interim brimming with illusions filled with commonplace delights that make the days go by with simple arguments and fears and with the nervous inkling of some vague utopian conceit transforming both the landscape and our lives until we look around and find ourselves at home but in a wholly different world and even those catastrophes that seemed to alter everything seem fleeting grounded in a natural order all of us are subject to and ought to celebrate —yet why that things are temporary doesn ’ t render them unreal unworthy of regretting it ’ s not as though the past had never happened all those years were real and their loss was real and it is sad—i don ’ t know what else to call it i ’ m glad that both of us seem happy yet what troubles me is just the way what used to be a world turned out in retrospect to be a state of mind and no more tangible than that and now it ’ s gone and in its place i find the image of a process of inexorable decay or of some great unraveling that drags the houses forward into emptiness and backwards into pictures of the intervening days love pieced together out of nothing and i ’ m certain that this austere vision finally is true and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe it comes from much too high above the world and seems to me too hopeless too extreme— but then i found myself one winter afternoon remembering a quiet morning in a classroom and inventing everything again in ordinary terms that seemed to comprehend a childish dream of love and then the loss of love and all the intricate years between
for brad gooch we snort all our coke on the way to the party we bring the new album we dance while we listen the band is two women whose husbands control them they do not speak our language each syllable ’ s an obstacle they are in love with a man he is in love with another but they ’ re in no hurry they could wait forever and when they are out on the make for a lover they ’ ll always find him they are the tigers we are stoned too stoned to we dance till we ’ re tired and listen to lyrics we mouth like a language what we feel when we hear them is inexpressible we can ’ t put into words maybe our dances show it abba lives for their music we long for each other they see what we ’ re doing they put it on record they play it we listen we are absolutely stunned we feel and they know more than anyone can say
their jeans sparkled cut off way above the knee and my friends and i would watch them from my porch books of poems lost in our laps eyes wide as tropical fish behind our glasses their football flashed from hand to hand tennis shoes gripped the asphalt sweat 's spotlight on their strong backs we would dream of hugging them and crouch later in weird rooms and come once their ball fell our way so two of them came over hands on their hips asking us to throw it to them which arthur did badly and they chased it back one turned to yell “ thanks ” and we dreamed of his long teeth in our necks we wanted them to wander over place deep wet underarms to our lips and then their white asses then those loud mouths one day one guy was very tired did n't move fast enough so a car hit him and he sprawled fifty feet away sexy but he was dead blood like lipstick then those great boys stood together on the sidewalk and we joined them mixing in like one big friendship to the cops who asked if we were and those boys were too sad to counter we 'd known his name tim and how he 'd turned to thank us nicely but now he was under a sheet anonymous as god the big boys crying spitting words and we stunned like intellectuals get our high voices soft as the tinkling of a chandelier on a ceiling too high to see
for i have seen love and his face is choice heart of hearts a flesh of pure fire fusing from the center where all motion is one and i have known despair that the face has ceased to stare at me with the rose of the world but lies furled in an artificial paradise it is hell to get into if i knew you were there i would fall upon my knees and plead to god to deliver you in my arms once again but it is senseless to try one can only take means to reduce misery confuse the sensations so that this face what aches in the heart and makes each new start less close to the source of desire fade from the flesh that fires the night with dreams and infinite longing
god love you dana my lover lost in the horde on this friday night 500 men are moving up down from the bath room to the bar remove this desire from the man i love who has opened the savagery of the sea to me see to it that his wants are filled on california street bestow on him lar- gesse that allows him peace in his loins leave him not to the moths make him out a lion so that all who see him hero worship his thick chest as i did moving my mouth over his back bringing our hearts to heights i never hike over anymore let blond hair burn on the back of his neck let no ache screw his face up in pain his soul is so hooked not heroin rather fix these hundred men as his lovers lift him with the enormous bale of their desire 6.20.58
weeks after ice-out last fall ’ s leaves make a pathway to the lake radiant blue and still deathly cold i press my hot forehead to the window smudging it blow and the glass steams as if looking at a photo through parchment i ’ m detached the way i saw his body in the cat scan from a foggy distance i ’ d like to open the window release a wounded bird nursed to health wiping the glass with my sleeve i see white pelicans wheel and flash in the sky
as fresh garbage is as dirt sucked out of a fingernail as a wall clean of prostitutes when i am this i am at the mercy of my nakedness a pillar of undress whose power i do not know how to wield i watch porn i study the geometry of limbs splayed not the moan but the angle of a moan i swallow in this way i am a thief sometimes i forget my body go untouched until i am touched scream sometimes i want to eat my breasts down to their bitter rind spit them out i want to be the bitter rind without suck and easily thrown easily thrown i want to be the pebble thumbed wished upon before enveloping the lake i sink in i sink in you the lake by lake i mean gutter a water that does not hold me well here we are not the bodies our mothers made if you are to hold me hold me as a gun grip me profit the dark the unattended purse the pair of heels darting from us in dull claps sharpening against the concrete as teeth against a stone
it 's hard to be humble when you 're 235 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal with a body women love and men fear —sputnik monroe when my father died he left me a trove of video tapes a warped memorial for those men he watched with my mother before she left for parts unknown for those fights he relived once he was laid off from the plane yards we watched men like sputnik monroe bleed the hard way shook our fists as he broke rules against guys who were easier to cheer he was a bad elvis greased-back hair with a shock of white sputnik monroe mixed it up everywhere a rodeo fistfight a henhouse tornado my mother picked a fight in an idaho truck stop once stabbed a man ’ s chest with her middle finger then stepped to one side so my father could fight him in the parking lot afterwards my mother was silent all the way back to seattle her disgust with him—the way he wrapped his arm around her shoulder guided her to the car and sped back to the freeway—hanging between them from that point forward sputnik monroe clobbered men wherever he went sneered at those fists raised against him in memphis some nights as my wife sleeps upstairs i watch my father ’ s video tapes and imagine what i would have done that day if i knew that my marriage depended on what i did with my hands
falling into unearthed light or something like that is who i was last night you brought me a drink you didn ’ t know the name of told me i could get it you not the drink which i downed even though it was my 9th of the night the drink not you dancehall always dancehall a manner of movement learned not easily lost so i wind my hips anyway something is happening to you you bout to start some shit i say good not because it would be i haven ’ t been touched in a while don ’ t start something you can ’ t finish is maybe the worst advice i ’ ve ever heard as you drop a handful of my ass thudding down a small flight of stairs that ’ s what i am a small flight of stairs a small flight down
misus and mopsa hardly could agree striving about superiority the text which says that man and wife are one was the chief argument they stood upon she held they both one woman should become he held both should be man and both but one so they contended daily but the strife could not be ended till both were one wife
“ it must be awful ” she said to the dog locked in it as she left the kitchen that wasn ’ t hers closing its door to head up the stairs with every good thing she could find to eat in her arms to eat in her arms—o katherine “ not to have any arms ”
a queer thing about those waters there are no birds there or hardly any i did not miss them i do not remember missing them or thinking it uncanny the beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone a quarry outraged by hulls we took pleasure in that the emptiness the hardness of the light the silence and the water ’ s stillness but this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes this hurt and goes on hurting the venomous soft jelly the undersides we could stand the world if it were hard all over
no moss nor mottle stains my parents ’ unmarked grave my word on them remains stouter than stone you told me “ martyred to words ” you have thought should be your epitaph at other times you fought my self-reproaches down though bitterly once or twice you have reproached me with how everything ended in words we both know better now you understand i shall not if i survive you care to raise a headstone for you i have carved on air
“ stooped to truth and moralized his song ” spring pricks a little i get out the maps time to demoralize my song high time vernal a little primavera first green first truth and last high time high time a high old time we had of it last summer i overstate but getting out the maps… look up the valley of the brenne louise de la vallière… syntax collapses high time for that high time to château-renault the tannery town whose marquis rooke and james butler whipped in vigo bay or so the song says an amoral song like ronsard ’ s where we go today perhaps perhaps tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow and… get well philip ’ s black-sailed familiar avaunt or some word as ridiculous the whole diction kit begins to fall apart high time it did high time high time and a long time yet my love get out that blessed map ageing you take your glasses off to read it stooping to truth we potter to montoire high time my love high time and a long time yet
love song for the newly divorced one day you will awake from your covering and that heart of yours will be totally mended and there will be no more burning within the owl calling in the setting of the sun and the deer path all erased and there will be no more need for love or lovers or fears of losing lovers and there will be no more burning timbers with which to light a new fire and there will be no more husbands or people related to husbands and there will be no more tears or reason to shed your tears you will be as mended as the bridge the working crew has just reopened the thick air will be vanquished with the tide and the river that was corrupted by lies will be cleansed and totally free and the rooster will call in the setting sun and the sun will beckon homeward hiding behind your one tree that was not felled
lathe of the ocean perpetual motion machine of the waves everything still being turned and shaped to a shape nobody foresees ten years ago was it when we walked that shore too earnest and sheepish to hold hands the wind cutting through our clothes cleansed and burned the chill off the atlantic an ache we courted in our dumbstruck talk callow expectant what wouldn ’ t love give cavalcanti ’ s ray from mars dante ’ s wheel that moves the planets and the stars how nervous we were awkward and shivering “ like this do you like it like this ” up all night then waking to the smell of flannel and sweat we lay grateful winded goosefleshed in the chill our own atmosphere rich and breathable we drank round the clock embracing extremes too hurried and heartsore to think of time… out fishing after midnight we watched schools of squid slide and shimmer tentacles tight-wrapped around our gig ’ s hooks yanked from the water they spouted jets of ink then pulsed and quivered and faded to dead-white their eyes resigned and sober opening wider and wider…ten years more and will either of us remember that ink sticky on our hands the moon-glare rippling as we knelt underneath the pier and scrubbed and scrubbed our hands in the dark water
children grow in secret they hide themselves in the depths and darker reaches of the house to become wild cats white birches one day when you ’ re only half-watching the herd as it straggles back in with the afternoon dust one child the prettiest of them all comes close and rises up on tiptoe to whisper i love you i ’ ll be waiting for you in the hay shaking some you go to find your shotgun you spend what ’ s left of the day firing at rooks and jackdaws uncountable at this hour and crows
there were two kingdoms only the first of them threw out both him and me the second we abandoned under a bare sky i for a long time soaked in the rain of my body he for a long time rotted in the rain of his then like a poison he drank the fondness of the years he held my hand with a trembling hand “ come let ’ s have a roof over our heads awhile look further on ahead there between truth and falsehood a little empty space ”
from daddy sprung my inborn ribaldry his crudeness destined me to be the same a seedlet flowered from a shitty heap i came the crowning glory of his aim from mother i inherited ennui the leg irons of the queendom i once rattled but i won ’ t let such chains imprison me and there is just no telling what this brat ’ ll ... this marriage thing we snub our nose at it what ’ s pearl turns piss what ’ s classy breeds what ’ s smutty but like it lump it neither ’ s exigent and i ’ m the end result of all that fucking do what you will this world ’ s your oyster pet but be forewarned the sea might drown you yet
september is a month like any other and unlike any other it seems in september everything awaited will arrive in the calm air in a particular scent in the stillness of the quay when september comes i know i ’ m going to lose myself the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so the air comes and goes beneath my dress pressing the warm cloth against me pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications the salty sticky wall of the malecón is covered with fish and forgotten hooks i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky in that moment the rest of the city can vanish it ’ s just that sea and me before all thought all desire then i undress and enter knowing i ’ ll find something and that the boats—which seem suspended on the horizon seem to have slipped their limits motionless and painted there—are also mine ... when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after—though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks shaping a sort of formless impression something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you but without making a human form and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle ’ s spoked wheel ... the bicycle moves on and i ’ m carried along filled with dry branches and coral in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together the little house one point amid the infinite comes into view already we can see the windows like little black voids and their curtains beating in the wind i squeeze your waist the bicycle moves on even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on rolls on against the spray when you turn your head and see my hand my hook snagged in a struggle of desire the sun has turned immense in your eyes again you make for the little house already in view already at the edge of the curve ... a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig his body—your body—is an arc i want to tighten to overcome to conquer hidden behind a tree i can see your eyes again the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries the arc tightens and closes i throw an arm over you a leg a hand a lip hallucinations an ear—as usual my body moves on the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries its water burns in my thighs in the course of my dreams the mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the united states it is born in lake itasca passes through st. paul st. louis memphis new orleans traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the gulf of mexico i ’ m in geography class i like this class the world just barely fits in my head the map hangs before me with its spokes and points someone made that all up just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there all those castles and fortifications to toy with the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality but isn ’ t because we ’ re not outside but inside the globe that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency and even far from the classroom nothing ’ s different there ’ s just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world always turning imperfect and constant inside me i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can ’ t measure i also like the geography professor whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself he doesn ’ t know he can ’ t imagine that while he lectures while he looks at me i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river the boy behind me won ’ t stop looking at me and whatever one does the others all follow watching from the corners of their eyes that ’ s why i ’ m going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won ’ t find me alone at my desk in the middle of the world ... in the middle of the lake there ’ s a boat and we ’ re three—although the third may have already vanished for us—and i want to paddle and sit in the center you ’ ve taken off your shirt the landscape appears and disappears when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge you try to teach me you take my hands—you ’ re behind and above me my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat i ’ m wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders we try to steer but go nowhere you explain the roundness of the earth the sharpened tip of the compass needle always precise marking contours lines limits the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances the symmetry forgetfulness incarnation in other beings animals plants and later men once again you taught me all this but i ’ m not a map and i hold still i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end the oar descends toward the deep it is september we don ’ t move i keep still to be different that ’ s why ...
i turn around i feel monday ’ s well-shaven face lightly caress my left shoulder most cherished part most crucial here and now
handsome like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high in little crystal globes handsome like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle if tulle were life handsome like a frozen face tear-tracked when the sun hammers down handsome like fire handsome like the bottomless sky with that one proud penetrating star but handsome too like a sky that ’ s an arching ocean and an earth prone as an ocean ’ s floor handsome ocean-sky and earth-sea floor the big question is where ’ s the man in a scene like this handsome the man asleep and the night sky swarms tropic and wide handsome in some ornamental muggy midnight caught between cat ’ s paws sharp-nailed they prick handsome the firefly swarms around you handsome like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin handsomeness a rainbow a rainbow an arrow an arrow in my chest handsome like shadows slow-rolling on a japanese screen handsome motion handsome as life and poison sun-blood handsome bleeding sun translated from the french by robert archambeau
for my little ballads those strange sunset-red laments spring paid me a gull ’ s egg i bade my lover paint my portrait on its thick shell he painted a new bulb in brown soil— on the other side a powdery mound of sand
we met in a coastal village spent a lovely night without leaving an address going separate ways three years later we meet again by coincidence the whole three years spun a novel we abandoned they fail to recognize themselves as though meeting in another story for an encounter one asks who are you so cold and weary the other says i only know a thread is loose on my sweater the more you pull it the more it lengthens until i completely vanish
for mary peace then i led her to the river certain she was still a virgin though she had a husband the fourth friday in july as good as on a promise the street lights were vanishing and the crickets flaring up last bend out of town i brushed her sleepy breasts they blossomed of a sudden like the tips of hyacinths and the starch of her petticoat bustled in my ear like silk slit by a dozen blades the pines minus their halo of silver grew huger and the horizon of dogs howled a long way from the river past the blackberry bushes the rushes and whitethorn beneath her thatch of hair i made a dip in the sand i took off my neckerchief she unstrapped her dress me my gun and holster she her layers of slips ... not tuberose not shell has skin as half as smooth nor does mirror glass have half the shimmer her hips flitted from me like a pair of startled tench the one full of fire the other full of cold that night i might as well have ridden the pick of the roads on a mother-of-pearl mare without bridle or stirrups gentleman that i am i won ’ t say back the scraps she whispered to me it dawned out there to leave my lip bitten filthy with soil and kisses i led her from the river and the spears of lilies battled in the air i behaved only the way a blackguard like me behaves i offered her a big creel of hay-colored satins i had no wish to fall for her she has a husband after all though she was still a virgin when i led her to the river
needed explanation because of the mystic nature of the theory and our reliance on collective belief i could not visualize the end the tools that paved the way broke the body the foundation the exact copy of the real our surfaces were covered our surfaces are all covered actual hands appear but then there is writing in the cave we were deeply impressed as in addicted to results oh and dedication training the idea of loss of life in our work we call this emotion how a poem enters into the world there is nothing wrong with the instrument as here i would raise my voice but the human being and the world can not be equated aside from the question of whether or not we are alone and other approaches to nothingness the term “ subject ” the term “ only ” also opinion and annihilation the body ’ s minutest sensation of time the world it is true has not yet been destroyed intensification void we are amazed uselessness is the last form love takes so liquid till the forgone conclusion here we are the forgone conclusion so many messages transmitted they will never acquire meaning do you remember my love my archive touch me here give birth to a single idea touch where it does not lead to war show me exact spot climb the stairs lie on the bed have faith nerves wearing only moonlight lie down lie still patrol yr cage be a phenomenon at the bottom below the word intention lick past it rip years find the burning matter love allows it i think push past the freedom smoke push past intelligence smoke whelm sprawl favorite city god ’ s tiny voices hand over mouth let light arrive let the past strike us and go drift undo if it please the dawn lean down say hurt undo in your mouth be pleased where does it say where does it say this is the mother tongue there is in my mouth a ladder climb down presence of world impassable gap pass i am beside myself you are inside me as history we exist meet me
afterward the compromise bodies resume their boundaries these legs for instance mine your arms take you back in spoons of our fingers lips admit their ownership the bedding yawns a door blows aimlessly ajar and overhead a plane singsongs coming down nothing is changed except there was a moment when the wolf the mongering wolf who stands outside the self lay lightly down and slept
we were dancing—it must have been a foxtrot or a waltz something romantic but requiring restraint rise and fall precise execution as we moved into the next song without stopping two chests heaving above a seven-league stride—such perfect agony one learns to smile through ecstatic mimicry being the sine qua non of american smooth and because i was distracted by the effort of keeping my frame the leftward lean head turned just enough to gaze out past your ear and always smiling smiling i didn ’ t notice how still you ’ d become until we had done it for two measures four —achieved flight that swift and serene magnificence before the earth remembered who we were and brought us down
pomegranates fell from the trees in our sleep if we stayed in the sun too long there were aloes to cool the burn henbane for predators and succulents when the rain was scarce there was no glorified past to point the way true and natural for the sexes to meet he kept looking to the heavens as if the answer were anywhere but here i was so bored with our goodness i couldn ’ t suck the juice from one more pear it ’ s here i kept telling him here rooted in the soil like every other tree you know and i wove us a bed of its uppermost branches
i want to write a love poem for the girls i kissed in seventh grade a song for what we did on the floor in the basement of somebody ’ s parents ’ house a hymn for what we didn ’ t say but thought that feels good or i like that when we learned how to open each other ’ s mouths how to move our tongues to make somebody moan we called it practicing and one was the boy and we paired off—maybe six or eight girls—and turned out the lights and kissed and kissed until we were stoned on kisses and lifted our nightgowns or let the straps drop and now you be the boy concrete floor sleeping bag or couch playroom game room train room laundry linda ’ s basement was like a boat with booths and portholes instead of windows gloria ’ s father had a bar downstairs with stools that spun plush carpeting we kissed each other ’ s throats we sucked each other ’ s breasts and we left marks and never spoke of it upstairs outdoors in daylight not once we did it and it was practicing and slept sprawled so our legs still locked or crossed a hand still lost in someone ’ s hair and we grew up and hardly mentioned who the first kiss really was—a girl like us still sticky with moisturizer we ’ d shared in the bathroom i want to write a song for that thick silence in the dark and the first pure thrill of unreluctant desire just before we ’ d made ourselves stop

the shadows of birds fading on a fighter ’ s back the undressing of words on an unstamped postcard the wet swings in the distant park the jealousy of raindrops on the umbrella of lovers the laughter of a boy before a bird the song of two flutes two swords two bracelets two fingers the stare of a wave before a pearl the yearning between the legs of a farmer ’ s wife the opening of doors closing midday the sudden howling of our muse—and les éventails—disturbing the guest inside of us
after you left me forever i was broken into pieces and all the pieces flung into the river then the legs crawled ashore and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow-track they became for a while a simple roadside shrine a tiny table set up between the thighs held a dusty candle weed-and-fieldflower chains placed reverently there by children and old women my knees were hung with tin triangular medals to cure all forms of hysterical disease after i died forever in the river my torso floated bloated in the stream catching on logs or stones among the eddies white water foamed around it then dislodged it after a whirlwind trip it bumped ashore a grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks had already rescued my arms and put them by knowing everything has its uses sooner or later when he found my torso he called it his canoe and using my arms as paddles he rowed me up and down the scummy river when catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up and blessed his reusable bait clumsy but serviceable that canoe the trail of blood that was its wake attracted the carp and eels and the river turtle easily landed dazed by my tasty red a young lad found my head among the rushes and placed it on a dry stone he carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell and set small offerings before it which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night so it seemed i ate and the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets so my lungs would sigh and my dead tongue mutter attached to my throat like a sacred necklace was a circlet of small snails soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head with its waterweed crown seers found occupation interpreting sighs and their papyrus rolls accumulated meanwhile young boys retrieved my eyes they used for marbles in a simple game till somebody ’ s pretty sister snatched at them and set them for luck in her bridal diadem poor girl when her future groom caught sight of her all eyes he crossed himself in horror and stumbled away in haste through her dowered meadows what then of my heart and organs my sacred slit which loved you best of all they were caught in a fisherman ’ s net and tossed at night into a pen for swine but they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded trampled one another in fear to get away and the fisherman ’ s wife who had thirteen living children and was contemptuous of holy love raked the rest of me onto the compost heap then in their various places and helpful functions the altar oracle offal canoe and oars learned the wild rumor of your return the altar leapt up and ran to the canoe scattering candle grease and wilted grasses arms sprang to their sockets blind hands with nibbled nails groped their way aided by loud lamentation to the bed of the bride snatched up those unlucky eyes from her discarded veil and diadem and rammed them home oh what a bright day it was this empty body danced on the riverbank hollow it called and searched among the fields for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun and never would have found them but then your great voice rang out under the skies my name —and all those private names for the parts and places that had loved you best and they stirred in their nest of hay and dung the distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar and the seers pursuing my skull their lost employment and the tumbling boys who wanted the magic marbles and the runaway groom and the fisherman ’ s thirteen children set up such a clamor with their cries of “ miracle ” that our two bodies met like a thunderclap in midday—right at the corner of that wretched field with its broken fenceposts and startled skinny cattle we fell in a heap on the compost heap and all our loving parts made love at once while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes and then went decently about their business and here it is moonlight again we ’ ve bathed in the river and are sweet and wholesome once more we kneel side by side in the sand we worship each other in whispers but the inner parts remember fermenting hay the comfortable odor of dung the animal incense and passion its bloody labor its birth and rebirth and decay
for john fogleman there are some things we just don ’ t talk about— not even in the morning when we ’ re waking when your calloused fingers tentatively walk the slope of my waist how love ’ s a rust-worn boat abandoned at the dock—and who could doubt waves lick their teeth eyeing its hull we ’ re taking our wreckage as a promise so we don ’ t talk we wet the tired oars tide drawing us out we understand there ’ s nothing to be said both of us know the dangers of this sea warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts— but we ’ ve already strayed from the harbor we thread a slow wake though the water—then silently we start to row and will for as long as this lasts
“ the most beautiful bodies are like transparent glass. ” they are bodies of the selfless or of those newly dead what appears transparent is really flame burning so brightly it appears like glass what you ’ re looking through is the act of giving one thing in life needed desperately given to another or perhaps life itself the most beautiful bodies are not transparent but sometimes the color of lead like the elephant whom a child with some peanuts lifts by the trunk in his hand in the swirling dust so that it appears he has lifted a monument or a city with all its pain the bodies that seem transparent are made of an ice so pure it appears to be glass sweating where you desiring another glimpse your own face that weighs nothing and is burning

flour on the floor makes my sandals slip and i tumble into your arms too hot to bake this morning but blueberries begged me to fold them into moist muffins sticks of rhubarb plotted a whole pie the windows are blown open and a thickfruit tang sneaks through the wire screen and into the home of the scowly lady who lives next door yesterday a man in the city was rescued from his apartment which was filled with a thousand rats something about being angry because his pet python refused to eat he let the bloom of fur rise rise over the little gnarly blue rug over the coffee table the kitchen countertops and pip through each cabinet snip at the stumpy bags of sugar the cylinders of salt our kitchen is a riot of pots wooden spoons melted butter so be it maybe all this baking will quiet the angry voices next door if only for a brief whiff i want our summers to always be like this—a kitchen wrecked with love a table overflowing with baked goods warming the already warm air after all the pots are stacked the goodies cooled and all the counters wiped clean—let us never be rescued from this mess
to keep me from staying out late at night my mother warned of the hell pig black and full of hot drool eyes the color of a lung—it 'd follow me home if i stayed past my curfew how to tell my friends to press pause in the middle of a video say their good-byes while i shuffled up the stairs and into my father 's waiting blue car how to explain this to my dates whisper why we could not finish this dance it 's not like the pig had any special powers or could take a tiny bite from my leg—only assurances that it was simply scandal to be followed home when my date and i pull into my driveway and dim the lights we take care to make all the small noises that get made in times like these even smaller squeaks in the seats a slow spin of the radio dial the silver click of my belt too late a single black hair flickers awake the ear of the dark animal waiting for me at the end of the walk my fumbling of keys and various straps a wild dance to the door—the pig grunting in tune to each hurried step each of his wet breaths puffing into tiny clouds a small storm brewing

johannes brahms and clara schumann the modern biographers worry “ how far it went ” their tender friendship they wonder just what it means when he writes he thinks of her constantly his guardian angel beloved friend the modern biographers ask the rude irrelevant question of our age as if the event of two bodies meshing together establishes the degree of love forgetting how softly eros walked in the nineteenth-century how a hand held overlong or a gaze anchored in someone ’ s eyes could unseat a heart and nuances of address not known in our egalitarian language could make the redolent air tremble and shimmer with the heat of possibility each time i hear the intermezzi sad and lavish in their tenderness i imagine the two of them sitting in a garden among late-blooming roses and dark cascades of leaves letting the landscape speak for them leaving us nothing to overhear
i swallow a pill but there is no cure a city map won ’ t get me where i want to go scaling the scaffold mindless of the mall unaware of driveways where housewives dodge the wrecking ball i crawl outside these vacant blues and into the contours of your eyes
i am always hungry wanting to have sex this is a fact if you get right down to it the new unprocessed peanut butter is no damn good you should buy it in a jar as always in the largest supermarket you know and i am an enemy of change as you know all the things i embrace as new are in fact old things re-released swimming the sensation of being dirty in body and mind summer as a time to do nothing and make no money prayer as a last re- sort pleasure as a means and then a means again with no ends in sight i am absolutely in opposition to all kinds of goals i have no desire to know where this anything is getting me when the water boils i get a cup of tea accidentally i read all the works of proust it was summer i was there so was he i write because i would like to be used for years after my death not only my body will be compost but the thoughts i left during my life during my life i was a woman with hazel eyes out the window is a crooked silo parts of your body i think of as stripes which i have learned to love along we swim naked in ponds i write be- hind your back my thoughts about you are not exactly forbidden but exalted because they are useless not intended to get you because i have you you love me it ’ s more like a playground where i play with my reflection of you until you come back and into the real you i get to sink my teeth with you i know how to relax so i work behind your back which is lovely nature is out of control you tell me that ’ s what ’ s so good about it i ’ m immoderately in love with you knocked out by all your new white hair why shouldn ’ t something i have always known be the very best there is i love you from my childhood starting back there when one day was just like the rest random growth and breezes constant love a sand- wich in the middle of day a tiny step in the vastly conventional path of the sun i squint i wink i take the ride
i went to my mother ’ s room at 13 past midnight and told her i was dying i ’ d wet the bed i ’ d had this crazy dream about a sexy neighbor i ’ d been spying on well i didn ’ t tell her that i mean the day before she asked who i was eyeing when i didn ’ t want to go outside for ice cream the truck was parked out front and she was buying but i couldn ’ t join the other screaming kids — not with lance applying suntan lotion to his muscled teenage skin stretched out on a beach towel in his front yard his body mystified me while mine seemed happy to defy me my dick would tent my cut-offs at the sight of him i wore two pair of underwear but even then i thought i ’ d burst right through the seams so i didn ’ t dare tell mother what i ’ d dreamed though she did think to ask me i ’ d have been a fool to tell her that she thought my blush was any boy ’ s puzzling out his sexuality but i swear it was as much because the fantasies were always other boys some from my baseball team some the roughnecks at school but usually lance he was flying naked in the dream i had that night the one that made me think that god was mad and killing me i was lying also naked — and hard as cinder block on the beach towel i ’ d seen him lay across the grass the day before i tried to understand the signs implying i might turn into some kind of freaky thing but it would have been cruel to tell my mother that especially when she was already crying and trying not to laugh at the same time when i showed her what came out of me she apologized for throwing such a scene said i was growing up to be a man that ’ s all it meant said it was normal for a boy my age ’ s thing to start uprising like a metal beam she apologized again that i didn ’ t have my dad around to train an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty i was as stupefied as i ’ ve ever been she never mentioned him and i have never turned a deeper red than i did then at 26 past midnight when my mother helped me change my sheets and said the next day she ’ d teach me to wash them and then she said she ’ d ask the man across the street to talk to me would that be okay or would i feel more comfortable with someone younger like his son
how long will the bed that we made together hold us there ﻿your stubbled cheeks grazed my skin from evening to dawn a cloud of scattered particles now islands of shaving foam slowly spiraling down the drain blood drops stippling the water pink as i kiss the back of your neck our faces framed inside a medicine cabinet mirror the blade of your hand carves a portal out of steam the two of us like boys behind frosted glass who wave goodbye while a car shoves off into winter all that went unnoticed till now — empty cups of coffee stacked up in the sink the neighborhood kids up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves how months on a kitchen calendar drop like frozen flies the flu season at its peak followed by a train of magic-markered xxx ’ ﻿﻿﻿s — nights we ’ ﻿﻿﻿d spend apart death must work that way a string of long distance calls that only gets through to the sound of your voice on our machine my heart ’ ﻿﻿﻿s mute confession screened out how long before we turn away from flowers altogether your blind hand reaching past our bedridden shoulders to hit that digital alarm at delayed intervals — till you shut it off completely
i never thought i ’ d keep a record of my pain or happiness like candles lighting the entire soft lace of the air around the full length of your hair/a shower organized by god in brown and auburn undulations luminous like particles of flame but now i do retrieve an afternoon of apricots and water interspersed with cigarettes and sand and rocks we walked across how easily you held my hand beside the low tide of the world now i do relive an evening of retreat a bridge i left behind where all the solid heat of lust and tender trembling lay as cruel and as kind as passion spins its infinite tergiversations in between the bitter and the sweet alone and longing for you now i do
if i could hold light in my hand i would give it to you and watch it become your shadow

all night the sound had come back again and again falls this quiet persistent rain what am i to myself that must be remembered insisted upon so often is it that never the ease even the hardness of rain falling will have for me something other than this something not so insistent— am i to be locked in this final uneasiness love if you love me lie next to me be for me like rain the getting out of the tiredness the fatuousness the semi- lust of intentional indifference be wet with a decent happiness

lonely as four cherries on a tree at night new moon wet roads a moth or a snowflake whipping past glass lonely as the red noses of four clowns thrust up through snow their shine four whitened panes drawn from imagined memory lonely as no other lives touching to recorded water all objects stare their memories aware lonely as pain recoiling from itself imagining the cherries and roses reaching out
they arrived at the desk of the hotel duncan and smithed in twitchy as flea-drummed squirrels her coat was squared and cream his patent shoes were little boats you wouldn ’ t put to sea in people not meaning to write themselves in to the soap that your life is rise or fall in the plot seems that they were fleeing from the 1980s much as a hummingbird flies from a flower ’ s bell these were the times when wine was still a treat and not yet considered a common bodily fluid you will have heard that the mind works much as an oval of soap turned between two hands she went round the room seeking lights that could be off without desire becoming love he spread his arms behind his head a gesture of libido she misread as test of temperature every carpet has its weave and underlay seen only by the maker the deliverer and the layer the year was a dog but the day was as good as a song that ends with a wedding meat on the rib evening was folding over the grid slick walkers with armfuls of books splendored in dusk ’ s ask the song of the pipes was eerie as a face pressed to glass as a basketball with a mouth and teeth they lay in the glow of the times and talked of how people form a queue to exact or escape love each sigh has a sequel she thought then he did then the whole hotel pulsed through that thought scandal has an inroad but you must tunnel out she rose and stood up counting all hair and beauty though we do not hear them beneath our own our shadows ’ footsteps clatter they match our dread
like silent naked monks huddled around an old tree stump having spun themselves in the night out of thought and nothingness— and god so pleased with their silence he grants them teeth and tongues like us how long have you been gone a child ’ s hot tears on my bare arms
how often now raging weeping for the days love gives then takes away takes from you the slightly chapped hand laid on the one you ’ re pointing at a tree and the voice that breathes coffeeberry bush into your mouth the finger that taps and feathers your ear but the giggle ’ s gone before you turn around the sandalwood scent hanging in the room the auburn strand like a flaw in the porcelain the off-course nail clipping in the carpet the days eat into your stomach knife you with longing for relief from love that you can not leave or leave alone from its rings of fire where you won ’ t burn down to ash or be transformed you become them and they keep burning and have a coffeeberry voice listen how their rhymes sing the little deaths you live
oakland make it the place it was then so full it split vision to live there in winter so late wet abundance toppled toward awful—birds of paradise a profusion the ripe colors of anodized metal in gutters umbrellas smashed like pigeons bent ribs bright among black slack fluttering camellias ’ pink imagoes dropping into water rotting sweet stink— did not stop the inundated eye over- populous urban eye the whole place to look at it was a footprint in january everywhere cloudy water rising to fill in the outlines meanwhile indoors differed by degree alone without love loosed from god there were lovers touch rushing in to redraw your boundaries constantly because it was a tune you kept getting wrong the refrain of what it meant to live alone months of that and then sudden summer sheer release streets all cigarettes sashay balls-out tube tops low-riders belly fat the girls on the block all like oh no she didn ’ t and girl she did she was mad skills with press-ons a cell phone telling him where to stick it a kid on her hip just like that summer sheer beauty lip gloss that smelled like peaches you going to the store for whiskey condoms like everyone else on a hot long afternoon so long hot it would just be sunburn to walk anywhere if it weren ’ t also a pleasure thoughtless shiftless horny drunk just someone thinking summer wasn ’ t up to anything deep lo there he was his punk ass pink as a viking in a tight wifebeater lingering by the public pool drinking beer so sly it didn ’ t look illegal he wasn ’ t a good idea but did you have a light it seemed the whole summer went like that taking fire out of your pocket giving it away a ditty you could whistle it was so cliché like the numbers they gave you after you never called the number of swollen nodes of the kissing colds you got later the number to call to get tested the number of the bus to the clinic the number they gave you when they asked you to wait the number of questions asked number of partners number of risks number of previous tests the number of pricks —one—to draw the blood the number of minutes you waited before results then you decided you had to get the tune right the how to live it so it doesn ’ t kill you to take a number wait in the long line of the city ’ s bankrupt humanism like the bus that never comes no matter how long you wait the grocery bag breaking if you were going to sing that one the one that sounds like all i got is bruised tomatoes broken glass dirty bread no one waiting at home would you start with genius as in the spirit of a place small as in of the back wet in heat the urge to touch him there skin just visible between his jeans t-shirt to see if he ’ s sweating to see if he feels what you feel if he does is that all the spirit the place will give a small thing shared just a phrase not a whole song but something to build on if it isn ’ t bread if it sure ain ’ t tomatoes it isn ’ t empty is it like the signage you walk by that fronts the lakeside church of practical christianity hawking a knowledge of god so modest it seems trivial it isn ’ t ever is it the how to live it so it doesn ’ t kill you the where to touch it the when will genius sing your name so it sounds like a place you can live
spilling water from my back you call and i come that exhausted walk to reach you breathless and no i didn ’ t run to see you i ’ ve been smoking too much same thing another awkward hug in the car as my face smashes your cheek that i can feel it leaving now is the saddest a beautiful eruption you could have picked it off the tree and chowed but you weren ’ t hungry feeling it dying away all day much worse than the straining against the leash another gorgeous thing that should not have happened gone again
long before the fresh apple crisis my life had some form to it i would wake in the mornings—i would perform something for example the day i tried as one with acute passion might to win one woman over but accidentally won another—that whole time i had been living like someone though i can ’ t remember his name his model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that i inhabit in time of need this time the need was surprising people tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk and apples take their shape naturally the guy whose name escapes me now taught me to look upon others ’ concerns as mine to make at home i was fond of doing many things at home but my favorite was drinking juice when my friends came by—they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands thinking they knew what i needed and planning to force it on me—i had to tell them i was busy with my juice two weeks before the crisis i had been writing some poems about it it was a warm day not entirely different from other warm days in san francisco people were on the street pale people were on the street making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned the poems i had written were failures but dense ones it seemed appropriate to think the person ’ s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people i had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can ’ t help but enjoy that day i had in a sense gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them i awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something—not anything life threatening but definitely personal my lover then wanted to spend much of her life asleep she had no ostensible reaction to the city ’ s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them in a world where a person ’ s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets i could not find four people who cared i thought that if i could find those four people we could really do something a few of my friends pretended they were chosen a few neighbors felt bad and made offers my mother called to console me my lover—in actuality the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop slept next to me sleep became our network falling in and out of it for change the rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time so i kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness if by morning i could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing she would reward me before the crisis the reward would have needed only to be an apple one but after the apples were gone the landscape usually contains the solution to what ’ s lost demographics help people in cars some people did not notice me some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me that was two days before the evening before it was two days before the crisis i was thinking that i did not think i was asleep i had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate ’ s cat in it when i looked again there was no light—but i had not been asleep it ’ s the way people react to traumatic events they say “ i had just been there ” or will say “ she was just with me. ” so the loss of light was emotional and the lost state—demographic i began to trace things by their disappearance alone in the room my memory and anticipated darkness going for light people like to talk about the daytime people in strange moods often miss the daytime before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods i had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste i was happy i mean i was in my juice five weeks before the crisis i was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house i did not really work there but i went there every week all but the third sunday of each month i would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale not to buy but to stand next to shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs that was one thing i would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn ’ t see i had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed my parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere my father would always say “ if you ’ re not going to be a people person then numbers will have to do. ” he was surprised that with all the time i had on my hands i chose to spend most of it alone numbers then did hold some mystery for me but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore for years i had known that if there was a wall between where i was and where i needed to be i did not want it there some people have personal goals that are demanding certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed my decision to drink only fresh juice which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast kept me busy rounding up cash i would have to leave most friendships behind as a way of keeping my life “ wall-free ” i had to divide my time i would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories the second part of my day i would spend telling people about the first part the other parts are not of substance here twenty-five years before the crisis i had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany i am always drinking in my poems a good friend says in the first years of my life everything i ate was mush today i will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this when i had that remarkable glass of apple juice i had no idea that one day i simply would not be able to find it the city gets rid of its apples people find themselves inventing fruit the day i decided to write poems about it—it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage—i had been resting in my best friend ’ s easy chair we were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me five days later i had twenty poems when a person writes a poem about her passions people on the street are bound to notice them the passions overwhelm the body she carries the body as though it were the book the friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week and though i miss her it was the failures that saved me on every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful if certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall the person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly in the alley behind the natural foods grocery i met my second lover for the first time meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present and the weather was so hot during the crisis only the alleys had shade forty-eight days into the crisis while on a thirst strike i had to make a run for the alley not as though people were after me but the elements the foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need at the bottom of any body-based need is grace when i appeared at the opening of the alley a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things—i thought about telling her or—short women make me want things all the time while i was growing up i put a lot of demands on my juice forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it i did not forget it but was embroiled the newspapers were saying things about the past people were celebrating thick juice and i kept writing those poems that day in the alley i realized three things about life while assisting her i learned three things to carry around with me to disperse when needed for six months during the crisis i did not care about the crisis when my faith returned all my lovers were gone that morning i woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis i was beneath my bed it was the sixth day that i had awakened beneath my bed i was lonely but i was also sure life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character who—when we passed on the street—did not know me i knew it was me by the way my head felt people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it today all my ideas are liquid that day of my faith friends thinking i was sick came by to see me it would be the last day i spent alone i was happy but still would not drink the juice on my mind was no longer juice there was an absence there but one so constant it became familiar i did not want to drink it
i wanted to tell the veterinary assistant about the cat video jason sent me but i resisted for fear she 'd think it strange i am very lonely yesterday my boyfriend called me drunk again and interspersed between ringing tears and clinginess he screamed at me with a kind of bitterness no other human had before to my ears and told me that i was no good well maybe he did n't mean that but that is what i heard when he told me my life was not worthwhile and my life 's work the work of the elite i say i want to save the world but really i want to write poems all day i want to rise write poems go to sleep write poems in my sleep make my dreams poems make my body a poem with beautiful clothes i want my face to be a poem i have just learned how to apply eyeliner to the corners of my eyes to make them appear wide there is a romantic abandon in me always i want to feel the dread for others i can feel it through song only through song am i able to sum up so many words into a few like when he said i am no good i am no good goodness is not the point anymore holding on to things now that 's the point
two guys sucking each other in the steam room didn ’ t want anything to do with me evidently— i left them to their comedy legato longings wish for walnuts wish for water wish to exorcise this morning ’ s debauch— two fauré nocturnes in slow motion steve tussled with a motorcycle trying to run me over on the boulevard of moon smut splicing together bridges and lagoons like the bride of frankenstein rushing to overtake the inert real a mass of facts some conjugal some comic— contrapuntal tenebrae
the rain whistled a taxi brought me to your apartment building and there i stood i had dreamed a dream of us in a bedroom the light shining upon us in white sheets you were singing me a song of your sailing days and in the dream i reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal which in bright red flew out the window sometimes when we talk on the phone i think to myself that the deep perfect of your soul is what draws me to you but still what soul is perfect all souls are misshapen and off-colored morning comes within a soul and makes it obey another law in which all souls are snowflakes once at a funeral a man had died and with the prayers said his soul flew up in a hurry like it had been let out of something awful it was strangely colored that soul and it was a funny shape and a funny temperature as it blew away all of us looking felt the cold

start this with the invocation a seventy-seven pinto an eastbound freeway two boys a few months from their driver ’ s license it happens again because you ’ ve said it you sit in the back seat a ghost of red vinyl to listen to these boys—one of whom was you the one along for the ride—talk brave about cheerleaders and socket wrenches as they pass a stolen cigarette between them they don ’ t know you ’ re there wouldn ’ t believe in you should they look backstage backseat the boys are driving back from an october orchard where they ’ d gone to see leaves change you remember orange brown as though you ’ d just seen those leaves because in this proximity to yourself—the boy in the passenger seat—you are thinking the same thing and each of your in- carnations feels like they ’ ve thought this before your ghost your present tense thinks that maybe this isn ’ t right now you ’ re along for the ride these boys haven ’ t cuffed up against their own mortality yet though one of them is sick the other one driving and picking at the thin hair falling from his scalp will die soon because what lurks in his dark blood can be cured by medical science and that cure is what will kill him as it leaves him weak unable to fight off infection in his lungs but that comes later you are here with them now to find out what you owe to whom—your life mortgaged to one of these boys and you ’ ve never been able to rectify that debt you are the stage direction a ghost backstage wanting a spotlight a soapbox a soliloquy dissolve back into your life like sugar in tea—exit this scene now stage left you are the apparition again in your mother ’ s house you follow yourself down the yellow hallway to the ringing phone in the kitchen you already know who ’ s calling the way you knew then—when you were the self you ’ re haunting your friend is dead you know this even before his sister tells you—but because your ghost is too close the boy can feel your grief but can ’ t feel his own and you did know then didn ’ t you you knew that morning that the earth awakes closest to the sun—four days into every new year and lazarus dead now four days roll away the stone believe in something besides the past awaken from this dream like a man called out from a cave it happens this way each time a bourbon breakdown in january rain—weeping an invocation cursing corollary can you go to tom ’ s grave today and mandate him back to this life should you cue him from the wing like a stage direction would he damn you—a sadness a gravestone on your chest for calling him into this mortal suffering if you had been in houston that day he ’ d have died anyway you ’ re a fool to think you can bargain across the river haunting the past won ’ t stop it from happening each time exactly the same way won ’ t stop your heart from breaking like a glass decanter brown whisky sliding mercury across the tile
i can ’ t tell you i had climbed for hours on ledges and crawled through gaps in the earth my hands negotiating through the teeth of the palisade lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies and i can ’ t tell you that i came onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood the opposite end of root speaking for its entirety through silence and color and i wish i could tell you that at the moment i met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone your name appeared in my throat with clarity and i wish we were old and in front of a grand painting a picture or postcard of picasso ’ s “ guernica ” perhaps it would be then that i would tell you picasso once said that it took him his entire life to learn how to paint like a child it would be through these words that would make you understand the same clarity that pooled over me on that ledge those years before when as a young man i extended like direction like timbre itself for a dying song that echoed your name
he faced the sink one foot up on the edge of the tub she stood behind him reaching around in the mirror her face rose over his shoulder like the moon and like the moon she regarded him beautifully but without feeling and he looked at her as he would at the moon how beautiful how distant no smiling no weeping no talking a man and a woman transacting their magnificent business with the usual equanimity the man as a passenger walking the ship ’ s deck at evening and the woman as the moon over his shoulder oiling the ocean with light deep in the ship ’ s belly pistons churned and sailors fed the boilers roar with coal on deck just the engine ’ s dull thrum and a faint click as the woman sets her ring on the cool white lip of the sink
how difficult it is to say goodbye to scourge for years we were obsessed with you your complex glycoproteins and your sly haphazard reproduction your restraint in your resistance how you bathed so slight yet fierce in our most intimate secretions we will remember you for generations electron micrographs of you seem quaint already in the moment of our victory how difficult it is to claim one ’ s right to living honestly the honesty you taught was nothing quite as true as death but neither was it final yes we vanquished you with latex protease inhibitors a little common sense— what ’ s that you say that some remain at risk how dare you try to threaten us again of course you ’ d like to make outrageous claims that some behaviors haven ’ t changed that some have not had access to the drugs that mask your presence in the body difficult it is how very sad to see you strain no pun intended at response—our quilts our bravest poetry our deaths with grace and dignity have put you in your place this elegy itself renounces you as from this consciousness you ’ ve been erased the love for you was very strong the hot pursuits so many of us reveled in— but what once felt like love was really not i hardly know what i will find to hate as much as i have loved and hated what you brought to bear upon my verse the weight of your oppression and the joys of truth how difficult it is—to face the white of nothingness of clarity we win
i. blood we wondered if the rumors got to her i ’ d seen her with that other girl behind the stop and shop when i was walking home from school one day i swear the two of them were kissing plain as that the grass so high it brushed their cheeks i told my teacher so and maybe it was her who called their folks before too long it was like everyone in town had heard we waited for them at the dime store once where cedric grabbed her tits and said i ’ ll learn you how to love how god intended it you ugly fucking dyke thing was she wasn ’ t ugly like you ’ d think she had a certain quality a shyness maybe and i ’ d describe the way she laughed as kind of gentle anyway we never saw her with that girl again they say she got depressed— shit at the service all of us got tearful i got to thinking what an awful sight it was all that red blood—it wasn ’ t in the papers but i heard melissa ’ s mother who was the nurse in the emergency that night say how she was just covered up in blood i can ’ t think how you bring yourself to cut your throat like that yourself—i asked the counselor they called in to the school and she said something like what better ink to write the language of the heart i guess it proves that stuff from bible school they say that such a life of sin breeds misery ii phlegm “ my brain is draining from my head ” he said as once again he blew his nose the clock read 3 a.m. its second hand swept slowly through another viscous minute dead to even nurses sticking them for new ivs the other ones slept off their benders soundlessly “ i ’ m losing my intelligence ” he said and blew my patience waned he thought he was the president dementia ks hiv were printed in his problem list “ and plus i ’ m getting feverish. ” i can ’ t recall his name but i remember hating him—grim wish that he would hurry up and die just then he took my hand and kissed the back of it as though i were a princess in his foreign land “ my lady you are beautiful ” he said and coughed again unsure of what to say my own throat burned he said “ you can ’ t know what i feel. ” iii bile a gun went off and killed a little girl the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer i walked through central park a black dog snarled at squirrels chattering like they had answers the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer i dreamed of killing someone with a knife the squirrels chattering had likely answers to all my angry questions about life— a homeboy threatened someone with a knife not far from where a cop showed off his gun an angry answer to most questions about life i watched the squirrels hop the yuppies run the cop approached the black kids with his gun i wondered how much longer she would live the squirrels scattered when the homeboy ran i wondered if she ’ d ever been in love i wondered who would pray for her to live forgive her for her anger and her weaknesses i wondered why it hurt to fall in love the cop tried aiming past me towards the woods forgive us for our anger for our weaknesses through central park past the black dog ’ s snarls the cop gave chase a skirmish in the woods the gun went off—no shrieked a little girl iv melancholy we picked at it with sticks at first until an older kid named samuel arrived he dropped a heavy rock right on its skull we watched as thick black slime began to ooze from somewhere just below its heart—or where we thought its heart should be “ raccoon ” said someone solemnly the landscaper— sweat gleaming like the polished figurines my mother wouldn ’ t ever let me touch— regarded us with keen suspicion from across the street we learned what it could teach like any body ’ s secrets the sublime receded toward the fact of death i knew both sadness and disgust in love ’ s untruths
what i would like to give them for a change is not the usual prescription with its hubris of the power to restore to cure what i would like to give them ill from not enough of laying in the sun not caring what the onlookers might think while feeding some banana to their dogs— what i would like to offer them is this not reassurance that their lungs sound fine or that the mole they ’ ve noticed change is not a melanoma but instead of fear transfigured by some doctorly advice i ’ d like to give them my astonishment at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping and how ridiculously gently it slicked down my hair i ’ d like to give them that the joy i felt while staring in your eyes as you learned epidemiology the science of disease in populations the night around our bed like timelessness like comfort like what i would give to them
i am trying to remember the lyrics of old songs i ’ ve forgotten mostly i am trying to remember one-hit wonders hymns and musicals like west side story singing over and over what i can recall i hum remnants on buses and in the car i am so often alone these days with echoes of these old songs and my ghosted lovers i am so often alone that i can almost hear it can almost feel the half-touch of others can almost taste the licked clean spine of the melody i ’ ve lost i remember the records rubbed with static and the needle gathering dust i remember the taste of a mouth so sudden and still cold from wintry gusts it seemed incredible then — a favorite song a love found it was n't after all days later while vacuuming the lyrics come without thinking days later i think i see my old lover in a café but don ’ t how pleasing it was to think it was him to finally sing that song this is the way of all amplitude we need the brightness to die some this is the way of love and music it plays like a god and then is done do i feel better remembering knowing for certain what ’ s gone

love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it camus all day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened keep the whole house tormented he is trying to reach the bees he is after bees this is the climax an end to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders last june on the porch floor i found them dead a sprinkle of dusty bugs and next day a still worse death until like falling in love bee-haunted i swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch i thought sickened and sickening me from what origin my life centered on bees all floors were suspect the search was hopeless windows were shut i never find where anything comes from but in june my husband ’ s fierce sallies began inspections cracks located and sealed insecticides shot outside the bees ’ course watched charted books on bees read i tell you i swept up bodies every day on the porch then they ’ d stop the problem was solved then they were there again as the feelings make themselves known again as they beseech sleepers who live innocently in will and mind it is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers that the bees were back no surprise to me but they had left themselves so lack-luster their black and gold furs so deathly faded gray bugs that the broom hunted were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch of heart takes place or a great shift of season november it came to an end no bees and i could watch the floor clean and cool and from windows the cold land but this spring the thing began again and his curse went upstairs again and his tinkering and reasoning and pride it is the man who takes hold i lived from bees but his force went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid and now in july he is tearing out the wall and each board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand it is quiet has been quiet for a while he calls me and i march from a dream of bees to see them winged and unwinged such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers— dirty clots of grubs sawdust stuck fliers all smeared together with old honey they writhe some of them but who cares they go to the garbage it is over everything has been said but there is more wouldn ’ t you think the bees had suffered enough this evening we go to a party the breeze dies late we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed we tell our funny story about the bees at two in the morning we come home and a friend a scientist comes with us in his car we ’ re going to save the idea of the thing a hundred bees if we can find so many unrotted still warm but harmless and leave the rest we hope that the neighbors are safe in bed taking no note of these private catastrophes he wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle not a bad thing to look into in the night we rattle and raise the lid of the garbage can flashlights in hand we open newspapers and the men reach in a salve of happenings i can ’ t touch it i hate the self-examined who ’ ve killed the self the dead are darker but the others have moved in the ooze toward the next moment my god one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes searching fingers sort and lay bare they need the idea of bees—and yet under their touch the craze for life gets stronger in the squirming whitish kind the men do it making a claim on the future as love makes a claim on the future grasping and i underhand i feel it start a terrible lifelong heave taking direction unpleading the men prod till all that grubby softness wants to give to give

yesterday i found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work of fine winter work thrown aside were my cigarettes with all the childish joys of summer into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun the muslins illuminate and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed so as better to work but i was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me for hardly had i drawn the first puff when i forgot the grand books i was planning to write and amazed moved to a feeling of tenderness i breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me i had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to france and now all of london london as i had lived it a year ago entirely alone appeared before my eyes first the dear fogs that muffle one ’ s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements my tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch the big fires and the maid with red arms pouring coals and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive once again i saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—i saw the open sea crossed so often that winter shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved decked out in traveller ’ s clothes a long dress dull as the dust of the roads a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival mangled as they are by the sea and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever

john ruskin letter to susan beever from assisi sacristan ’ s cell june 25 1874 to-day being my sixty-first birthday i would ask leave to say a few words to the friends who care for me and the readers who are anxious about me touching the above-named illness itself for a physician ’ s estimate of it indeed i can only refer them to my physicians but there were some conditions of it which i knew better than they could namely first the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions whether in sleep or trance or waking in broad daylight with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room while yet i saw others that were not there and the not morbid however dangerous states of more or less excited temper and too much quickened thought which gradually led up to the illness accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain — john ruskin fors clavigera letter 88 february

... how many flowers are named in genesis good answer not one plenty of trees however it was a poet planted flowerbeds that eden might be filled with tremulous frivolous petals — i dare say he was right they were made to be noticed and to see a poppy husk fall from a bursting flower is to know something of the life to come once the body has turned to dust ashes even as our dying breath aspires toward our father ’ s house ... as for the trees what can we learn of noble constancy more than we find in the pure laurel leaf so numerable so sequent and serene open the envelope petals may spill on

none of these none touch me more nearly now if i say “ st ursula has sent me a pot of pinks ” some will say i have gone heartily headily mad but all it means is that the flowers i received of late

toward a wood decked with countless jewels stones it is hard to credit a sight so fine as the wash of light in which they shone woman never wove a gown so dearly adorned so lit with splendor in splendor cliffs of crystal stood crisp as ice clear clean at their foot a forest spread the trees were touched with a red-blue sheen and leaves of burnished silver slid quivering to fro between limbs that shimmered like blue jade each time a light-gleam touched the scene the gravel underfoot was strewn with gems and the sun seemed quite outshone by those precious oriental stones so dearly adorned so lit with splendor the splendor of the grove was such that my grief left me — it lifted clear the fragrance of the fruit so fresh i found i needed no other fare birds flew together branch to branch like flecks of flame — now here now there no human symphony can match nor voice nor string delight the ear with such a song they blessed the air with a sweet accord that swooned shone with harmonies you will never hear but there where all is lit with splendor so adorned in splendor was that forest where i met my fate a cunning man could not devise a fitting way to tell of it climbing pear trees apple trees browsing wonders — pretty sport and soon the flowers fields hedgerows turned beautifully intricate with burns water gardens bright as burnished gold the fellside shone where i trailed a stream that ran with light dearly adorned lit with splendor but a greater splendor was yet to come a riverbank of beryl ablaze where water swept swirled in a foam of hurrying murmurs confused airs the

a minor brush with medicine in eighty years was all he ’ d known but this was different his right arm limp and slung his right leg dead to feeling and response he let me spoon him chicken-broth later he said without self-pity that he ’ d like to die i bluffed “ the doctors think that therapy might help you walk again. ” “ they ’ re liars all of them ” he muttered bedfast was never how he hoped to go “ in bed you think of everything ” he whispered with a shrug “ you think of all your life. ” i knew he meant my mother without her he was never what he might have been and everyone who knew him knew it nothing could take her place— not the cars he loved to drive not the money he could earn at will not the roads he knew by heart from florida to saranac not the two replacement wives who never measured up fed now by family or strangers carried to the john shaved and changed by hired help this independent man turned silent at the end only my wife could reach him for his private needs what no one else could do for him he let her do she talked to him and held his hand the left she helped him bless himself and prayed beside him as my mother might have done “ darling ” was his final word for her softly in arabic

there 's a flutter of grey through the trees ah the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is i see not her face i but see the swift re-appearance the flitting persistence— there —of that flutter of grey in the distance it has flickered and fluttered away what a teasing regret she has left in my day-dream and what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may dream it was only a flutter of grey but the vaguest of raiment 's impossible chances has set my heart beating the way of old dances
cloud cover like a badly made bed ruched in sections rushed whatevered for reasons of a lifetime of do-overs why bother trying to change the gathered duvet sometimes mimics you makes double dopples a decoy an escape plan the safety of numbers and cover when the wing dips a hole in the sky revealed until then a man in the aisle seat calculations to see if it ’ s possible to slide through the fisheye window if he touches your thigh again your face we like our planes fashioned after ships the illusion one could jump or be forced off and possibly survive between the distance and everything that wants to live how it ’ s always lived without compromise when does knowing a person begin was it when he said you look like his ex-wife hair naturally red not like yours fake he can tell but it ’ s ok. what your children together would look like that if you had been born in fayetteville he would ’ ve liked to have known you feels he does not like the absent husband his mind weds you to the one who abandoned you to his company like a firing squad to its post waiting for a reason to prove worth the moment he asked for vodka on the 53-minute flight from charlotte to wilmington to bridge the gap between pre- and post-flight beers or how he lifted his shirt to show you where his lungs had been punctured and once collapsed he said he ’ d briefly died and now is briefly alive

lostness is the you are here the red star that the mall map linked to gps as if you ’ d stared into your nowhere like a sun and photoreceptors compensated with a point lostness is an immaculately well-dressed person or a room laid out like charcuterie it ’ s a feeling someone loves you after a ten-minute talk oh yes but lostness is loving someone too knowing you would take the raft out further if it meant a few more minutes sometimes i want to tell my dog that i ’ m the only one in the world who knows her whereabouts and that ’ s lostness but it ’ s lived in it isn ’ t sadness lostness is the job i had in ’ 98 in a warehouse unpacking chic decor where i began to unravel and unmake the very things the company was selling it was the boxes i moved forward on the shelves until they lined up well pop choruses that played again for the beautiful and found it ’ s almost gladness it ’ s the walk i took one day trying to decide should i live in montreal and thinking that i knew something to make it plain lostness is the many rains of money that i once watched from an open window it ’ s long been here it was the semilunate carpal flowering in late-cretaceous bones where everything was going then never more unclear it was the first prokaryote closing off its little o and all that it could be instead but lostness is a steady wage i remember when my grandfather would come home from the squats and thousand double checks of electrical work and wash his hands all the dirt moved in his laundry sink like garter snakes that turned up under stones a living current so bearable in its lostness that i could know it only for a hundred years and still be happy lostness was the school i went to where leaving crumbs on rectangles of paper meant showing the way someone would have to come it was having your knapsack up on the table like a personal flotation device it wouldn ’ t be wrong to say that lostness is always there on the lip of everything like lichen or a bomb there is a loving lostness that if you look deep into you see a great balance beam that everything that was or is or that may be is standing on

i keep returning to john constable ’ s study of clouds oil on cardboard six by seven and a half inches it shows purple-gray thunderheads one patch of blue above low hills and two small trees flanked by shrubs in the left foreground a sketch en plein air a half hour ’ s worth of work at most it catches exactly one scrap of sky and shifting sunlight on a blustery day in 1820. the year king george the third died in windsor castle blind and insane the year 50,000 scottish weavers went on strike and printed a proclamation calling for a new “ provisional government. ” their leaders were caught hanged and then decapitated for good measure this cloud study survived that history two minutes later the clouds would have taken on a different cast of light and shape just like the thunderheads now piling up above the liffey i hobble out of the dublin city gallery take a bus to the river sit on a park bench with a ziplock bag of ice on my swollen knee its wet cold makes the joint ache my body is breaking down bone spur under the right kneecap at fifty-eight i watch young men and women in black sweats run along the river liffey — abha na life anna liffey river that crosses the plains of life i envy them once i too could run over the asphalt almost without knowing i inhabited a body whose knees might seize up and swell i will not run again in this life cirrus and cumulonimbus scud across the blue escutcheon of sky sun ’ s blazon through rain rampant my life is a cloud study for some larger landscape john constable never got around to painting it hangs in a gilded frame people stare at it before passing on to more important canvases to renoir ’ s les parapluies women and men opening shiny black umbrellas in a paris park there a mother shelters her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one the younger daughter holds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt paths whipping it with a stick to keep it spinning before the rain settled in renoir painted this small family in his lush impressionistic style five years later after visiting italy and studying piero della francesca ’ s frescoes he came back and finished the painting in his new “ manière aigre ” or harsh style he handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman ’ s dress on the left as if they were granite to be sculpted she carries a market basket filled to the brim with shadow to approach old age one needs a new harsher style here by the liffey mothers push screaming infants in strollers five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoats walk by joking texting on cell phones smoking one girl and her boy hang back embrace french-kiss a long ten seconds another boy shouts over his shoulder “ get a room ” a pair of mute swans preens and swims down the river liffey whose amber waters mirror how the clouds pass avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnished unrippling surface of my memory — vast sky surf cloud after cloud cresting breaking to be washed away to blue nothing each of us — lovers mothers runners me — no more than windblown swansdown
i was so thirsty you cracked an egg into my mouth i ate it thanked you we were so rich then i imagined the moon a being i ’ d never seen in every nail you ’ d use to tack the tarp over our heads i confused hens clucking for the ringing of the phone you ’ d never let me answer with a spatula to my ear i ’ d pretend to be a woman on tv say ¿bueno your anger was the gun you kept by the door my fear the knife i used to chop onions one night you confused the sound of a snake rattling for rain the snake opened its jaw its fangs were the color of mud you reached for my thighs just before you died i couldn ’ t face you once you stopped breathing i rubbed your beard between my hands played the most beautiful cumbia we danced for the first time since our wedding
i read a korean poem with the line “ today you are the youngest you will ever be. ” today i am the oldest i have been today we drink buckwheat tea today i have heat in my apartment today i think about the word chada in korean it means cold it means to be filled with it means to kick to wear today we ’ re worn today you wear the cold your chilled skin my heart knocks on my skin someone said winter has broken his windows the heat inside and the cold outside sent lightning across glass today my heart wears you like curtains today it fills with you the window in my room is full of leaves ready to fall chada you say it ’ s tea we drink it is cold outside
it ’ s more than silhouettes tonight every window in the city lit shades lifted curtains open as one suspected the dark buildings full of lovers undressing beneath light bulbs before mirrors men women men men women women embracing even the loners visible flickered by single candles touching places they ’ ve usually chosen to keep secret so much nakedness and the streets empty except for the newsboys moving through shadows leafless trees snatching underclothes out of wind the el clattering above the roofs like a strip of blue movie
wolf moon no moon in sight so i howled at the exit sign instead red runes electric telling an old story of escape of wind a wide cold a distant car alarm otherwise the dark and our bodies two strange women trying to touch each other breathing strange moving toward or away from each other as the red ghost in the sky opened called us gone showed us the door to another world otherwise the dark and our mouths tearing at what bones we could find grinning and hungry for something — something we couldn ’ t with all our words name snow moon the magic where the streetlights turn the snow pink lasts only for the first night the same way maybe a blanket loses track of its scent when it ’ s been touched by too many hands or the way a body grays when too many feet have dragged their cigarettes and complaints through it but for that one first night everything cold- flecked and whispering was ours the pink light ours sent from some other world so we could for a night feel untouched so we could feel like sugar—crumbling and perfect for it worm moon like any girl i pulled myself into shreds to test the rumor that something with blood like mine could be halved and still whole and what did i learn i buried myself all over the garden but the pieces only sprouted into new riddles squid leg spaghetti squash a jerking thumb their names still sounded like mine everyone in the same dress chewing dirt to avoid each others ’ eyes i lay down next to the one beneath the porch hiding among the oyster shells don ’ t cry i said but she cried anyway her tears fell straight into my eyes what a lesson—to watch them float back and forth between us until we knew each one ’ s shape until we knew finally what to do with them pink moon outside the colors leapt from the trees here inside some new word was blooming in my underwear—darker than i ’ d expected i ’ d expected something pink a slow sweet trickle not this wet tar treacle dark like the blood had been stretching inside me for years slow-building into a sticky chord the first falling away soil ’ s been watered come play first stuck first gum first hum of pollen calling in the bees and readying to wilt flower moon spring is the season of crying and seeing nothing of choking up on someone else ’ s trash barbed tennis balls that lodge wherever air ’ s supposed to go nasal cavity homewreckers all spring my lenses wrenched themselves from my eyes jumped ship spore-lined and furious everything melted and ran down my face all the trees wanted my number sent fuzzy messengers to murmur in my ears i get so afraid sometimes all i want all i want is all spring i brushed confessions out of my hair tore the little letters apart and locked myself in the refrigerator until the world promised to stop birthing such soft things strawberry moon the house was filled with the smell of it the last misshapen sweet-heavy berries of the season losing their shapes on the stove the house was filled with the smell of fruit unbecoming fruit pulled to its knees at fire ’ s feet all summer long the bushes had whispered take me shown us all the places we could kiss if we wanted and so as the light died we put our mouths on the least lovable the too-full the easy-bruised we shouted i choose you and you and you and you and canned that hunger and spooned it into our mouths on the coldest days buck moon some of the cloven-hoofed things are good at leaping from one rock shelf to another without shattering good in other words at falling i never trusted that ankles were any match for my body ’ s insistence on becoming earth again so when i found myself on the cliff face i knew it was dive or dust a boy called to me from the bottom of the gorge called me all the names he knew and i stood frozen wearing a crown of bones the gravel laughed as it fled from my feet i shouted down to the boy don ’ t try to milk me unless you ’ re fond of being kicked — buck and bray and jawbone he responded no totally sounds tough how are you feeling sturgeon moon i hid in his rivers and estuaries i ate his wet earth ’ s crops i grew plump for him grew egg-lined thirty tiny hearts in my belly fruit thumping with seeds he pulled me from the mud laid me out in the sun opened me down the center scraped every dead daughter from my silly maw i learned better next time next time i grew three extra rows of seeds hid them in my mouth sharpened them to teeth harvest moon last winter when we finally kissed under fluorescent lights that was the seed we pressed between the ground ’ s lips then i laughed when the sky collapsed into

where did the handsome beloved go i wonder where did that tall shapely cypress tree go he spread his light among us like a candle where did he go so strange where did he go without me all day long my heart trembles like a leaf all alone at midnight where did that beloved go go to the road and ask any passing traveler — that soul-stirring companion where did he go go to the garden and ask the gardener — that tall shapely rose stem where did he go go to the rooftop and ask the watchman — that unique sultan where did he go like a madman i search in the meadows that deer in the meadows where did he go my tearful eyes overflow like a river — that pearl in the vast sea where did he go all night long i implore both moon and venus — that lovely face like a moon where did he go if he is mine why is he with others since he ’ s not here to what “ there ” did he go if his heart and soul are joined with god and he left this realm of earth and water where did he go tell me clearly shams of tabriz of whom it is said “ the sun never dies ” — where did he go translated from the persian

image tensed i eye the instant anticipation welling— and i expect no one in the lit shadows i watch as the doorbell sheds its inaudible pollen of sound— and i expect no one within four walls astounded more by space than any desert place i expect no one but come he will he must if i hold on to bloom unseen he ’ ll suddenly appear when i am least aware coming as if to forgive all he gives to death coming to assure me of his reward and mine coming as anodyne for my pain for his— perhaps his whisper is already on its way
1 a wren perched on a hawthorn low enough to skip the scalping winds sang a scalpel song seafrets drift sheer along shorelines listening to hail spray glass and wind and a waitress laugh in a cafe without customers i fell to fell thinking a sullen light through vapor thins a line of hills the edge of everything is nothing whipped by wind watched on a webcam bound to a bedpost gag on my shaft rose blush of road-kill rabbit insides out on tarmacadam cumulus in a tarn its fast shadow flees far hills a wave of sleek grass skiffs mist my hand thought of her a photograph waiting to happen this come-to-kill wind rips at the root here she comes and there she goes rushes bow to rime i should shut down close off stop if i could how quick the mist how quick 2 my lover the assassin is beautiful she has come to kill me and i concur just now she sleeps but when she wakes i ’ m dead her eyelids flitter as i prepare her potions her delicious poisons as she flew past a lick of her melodic nectar stuck to my wing making flight for an instant sticky but nothing preening couldn ’ t fix she asked about my heart its evasive flight but can i trust her with its secrets and does the merlin in fast pursuit of its prey tell the fleeing lark it is enamored of its song or the singing lark turn tail and fly into the falcon ’ s talons my heart the cartographer charts to the waterline is swept back as the tide turns wiping the map blank wave after moon-drawn wave but it beats my heart of its own volition a lark sings winds rush reeds walking home i stride these tracks with her tread the blurred thumbprint of a smudged moon 3 it has gone on for days strumming rushes taking up tales taking them on the fall of my foot on tufts a stroke of light along a law lain in under a long cloud i accrete—lichen to limestone sphagnum to peat late shadows gather in the dark words unwrite as they are written unspeak as they are spoken songs sprung from heart and lung to tongue unsung drunk winds stumble over shuffling roofs shake his sleep who dreams a lost love will not let go recurring swirls of old gold blown light you can ’ t help but be in it as it opens and falls back on itself unfolds and unsays i do not want to die without writing the unwritten pleasure of water
my husband and i were arguing about a bench we wanted to buy and put in part of our backyard a part which is actually a meadow of sorts a half acre with tall grasses and weeds and the occasional wild flower because we do not mow it but leave it scrubby and unkempt this bench would hardly ever be used and in summer when the grasses were high would remain partially hidden from view we both knew we wanted the bench to be made of teak so that it would last a long time in the harsh weather and so that we would never have to paint it teak weathers to a soft silver that might in november or march disappear into the gray hills that are the backdrop of our lives my husband wanted a four foot bench and i wanted a five foot bench this is what we argued about my husband insisted that a four foot bench was all we needed since no more than two people presumably ourselves would ever sit on it at the same time i felt his reasoning was not only beside the point but missed it entirely i said what mattered most to me was the idea of the bench the look of it there to be gazed at with only the vaguest notion it could hold more people than would ever actually sit down the life of the bench in my imagination was more important than any practical function the bench might serve after all i argued we wanted a bench so that we could look at it so that we could imagine sitting on it so that unexpectedly a bird might sit on it or fallen leaves or inches of snow and the longer the bench the greater the expanse of that plank the more it matched its true function which was imaginary my husband mentioned money and i said that i was happier to have no bench at all which would cost nothing than to have a four foot bench which would be expensive i said that having no bench at all was closer to the five foot bench than the four foot bench because having no bench served the imagination in similar ways and so not having a bench became an option in our argument became a third bench we grew very tired of discussing the three benches and for a day we rested from our argument during this day i had many things to do and many of them involved my driving past other houses none of which had benches that is they each had the third bench and as i drove past the other houses i could see a bench here and a bench there sometimes i saw the bench very close to the house against a wall or on a porch and sometimes i saw the bench under a tree or in the open grass cut or uncut and once i saw the bench at the end of the driveway blocking the road always it was a five foot bench that i saw a long sleek bench or a broken down bench a bench with a slatted back or a bench with a solid carved back and always the bench was empty but i knew that for my husband the third bench was only four feet long and he saw always two people sitting on it two happy or tired people two people who were happy to be alive or two people tired from having worked hard enough to buy the bench they were sitting on or they were happy and tired happy to have reached the end of some argument tired from having had it for these people the bench was an emblem of their days which were fruitful because their suffering had come to an end on my bench which was always empty nothing had come to an end because nothing had begun no one had sat down though the bench was always there waiting for exactly that to happen and the bench was always long enough so that someone if he desired to could lie all the way down that day passed another day followed it and my husband and i began once more to discuss the bench the sound of our voices revealed a renewed interest and vigor i thought i sensed in him a coming around to my view of the bench and i know he sensed in me a coming around to his view of the bench because at one point i said that a four foot bench reminded me of rough notes towards a real bench while a five foot bench was like a fragment of an even longer bench and i admitted it was at times hard to tell the difference he said he didn ’ t know anything about the difference between rough notes and fragments but he agreed that between the two benches there was possibly just perhaps—he could imagine it—very little difference it was after all only a foot we were talking about and i think it was then in both of our minds that a fourth bench came into being a bench that was only a foot long a miniature bench a bench we could build ourselves though of course we did not this seemed to be essentially the bench we were talking about much later when the birds came back or the leaves drifted downwards or the snow fell slowly and lightly at first then heavier and faster it was this bench that we both saw when we looked out the window at the bench we eventually placed in the meadow which continued to grow as if there were no bench at all
i. tripartite schemes were all very well for the builders who held their blueprints firmly in hand beforehand what did it matter if the two vertical poles didn ’ t touch seemed so far apart in fact that no one who visited the site could believe the architect ’ s arrogant babble before they knew it he ’ d bridged the two poles with a plank i have hidden under these structures of synthetic comfort when the sky was overcast i have even hired a claque of unemployed actors to stand there with me but speaking for myself i find their tentlike charm diminishing over on the next hill is a line of poker-faced upright slabs their bases deep in the dirt their function something else entirely ii i keep seeking this pleasure-giving eye mote you fill your pew and my view with golden uncontrollable emanation and the music surges in response a coded story of hope and disappointment decipherable to the few is it wrong to be overheated here or not to have left my coat at the entrance the only crime would be not to swoon to see and ignore you or brand you a brother in spotless devotion beneath the bleeding windows hearts must have heft masses of skin become human tremors to feel the force of the organ on its own the rite is a starchy obligation add intrigue and the altar ripples and ripples iii over the hub of the hill a solid wall of silver leaves underfoot soil without burrows blanketing soil and leaves a scrim of hushed and unpunctured blue then all of a sudden rumors of something about to happen the night restless with its own unkeepable secrets the very air strained and achingly electric because you are not here nighttime behaves this way calling for terms i ’ d long since put away susurration intrigue reverberant it is only in your magnanimous absence that stony surroundings can sing your praises so i curse even as i gape to know that their raving requires your being anywhere else the evening hums in compensation iv his beak is open as if in mid-worm or mid-sentence his feet impressively sturdy as they straddle the street what gives him away though is the magenta pool spreading rapidly under this otherwise unruffled stomach something ended this bird so suddenly that he never had time to strike a normal death pose it would be overdone and untrue to say i am the bird to paint myself in similar terms as stunted irretrievably downed forever rooted to unkind ground it would smack of self-pity we are partners instead beneath a general rubric of doom an arrow descended and brought him startled to death me screamingly to life v. i loved a statue and watered it daily sooner or later it softened and let me break a vital part of it off with my hard-won prize in my pocket i explored the streets with a secret but before long the plundered piece was dust in my hands and painful to look at now another effigy makes me shudder at its criminal threshold more than ever i entertain a shameless urge to steal or caress it but the facts of history tell me otherwise you get what you pray for and the statue dwindles to rubble vi although others lack the sharpened knives to be villains they do what they can with blunter instruments sparring to kill time falling to fisticuffs when eloquence evades them they get their day ’ s entertainment from instruction manuals bought at auctions when one utters his bored “ touché ” a gaggle of fans surround him how much deadlier is your collection of swords with a history scimitars that glint even when strung up and inactive although i would gladly lay a whetstone at your door for one blinding night of thrust-and-parry you have no need of anything resembling aid one twist of your weapon outstabs the meanest ranks of dullard soldiers vii the avuncular figure with grizzled beard the bearer of balm for the stricken and abandoned the craggy but spirited sickle-carrier paces the page of a long-forgotten book of days and never once frowns there is no need to our days may be numbered but and here his eyes mist over with comforting thoughts of gold and rainbows his evil twin wants none of this waiting this starry-eyed torpor hoping to scare eternity into submission he too brandishes a sickle but everything goes wrong he pierces his own leg and must go on crutches before long he falls into childish fits of self-pity proffering sickle and leg to hirelings saying “ lop it off boys and be quick. ” viii during the first stages of frenzy a glut of meaning descends on nature as if to spite cynics who call dirt nothing but dirt terrific breezes mere conveyors of pollen something in the sufferer ’ s mind seeks out and finds corroboration in vast planets and puny insects all are as prone to nervous tics all whirring with badly kept secrets time passes and the system turn on you when all is sacred nothing is safe silent lampposts suddenly pipe up in irresistible colloquy a tone too high the sky calls you but does not want your replies and water-bound birds decline pronouns in latin it is a hotbed that can not stand the addition of an offending presence it whispers until you are well on your way ix before you came on the scene and blasted the image to bits i thought of love as a spacious courtroom where evidence was presented graphically and up front where deserving plaintiffs got what they wanted legally and where judges beamed beneath picturesque wigs when they saw happy verdicts amicably arrived at these days law is something to be left at the door along with galoshes i spend my nights in sinister mock-trial playing all the parts “ guilty or not ” booms our pot-bellied exquisitely bored judge i answer for you “ not your holiness this harridan framed me. ” and then i object and then hunched over in a corner of the courtroom a juror suggests we all go out to lunch x. it was a run of the mill journey until the windows seemed to have melted outside the train the foliage of early summer received an instantaneous drenching startled i thought of you like a lovesick heroine out of an old romance “ holding her heart agawp at nature ’ s rages she would watch the storm from inside and secretly like it. ” no longer dainty hand-to-the-head the tragic meaningful stare out the window no storm buffets alone however stunningly leaves may shudder and press against the pane it is a wasted downpour if nobody comes out soggy reaching my stop i left my cap and trenchcoat inside a locker and headed for the wet jungle hot on your heels xi our meeting is as stiff as a long-dead thoroughbred like its former coat we too are glossy and brief no frizzy wire springs up that is not dutifully cropped our every neigh is strictly by the book place us in a lineup of similarly frozen stallions and you will not know one rigor mortis from another and another i could endure a salvo of kicking a brutish uprearing nag or a vicious race to the finish over this wingless duo of moribund mares i could even stand it if you leapt up and started poking holes in my horse metaphor anything other than the way our speech resembles the two extremes of stunted growth gorgeous stillborns cynical has-beens this is no time for pleasantry xii i have been dreaming you into the picture when you bound unseeing past me i tingle onward with knees of jelly glad to be confirmed in my scheming this walk is no hopeless ramble but a perfect way of seeing and being seen fate sensing my hopes obligingly guides you outdoors what rankles is the time it takes me to realize that you are truly tangibly here i have been holding so many secret meetings with you that this brief encounter this perfect opportunity passes doesn ’ t register i see you in retrospect you were here jacket flapping in the noon breeze and gone by the time i had presence of mind to grasp it xiii explaining camouflage a useful way of suiting yourself to your habitat so that you steal its features more than it steals yours in war a surefire method of avoiding skirmishes in love a vanishing act that lets you watch the object of your affection in whose vagrant eyes you might as well be a pebble a flaw on the leaf or a ruinous self-effacement brainchild of the timid deserving to be trounced by the rustle in the trees which announces a vital presence the force which storming a fortress subjects its tenant to a scrutiny of his most cherished beliefs the stunning hybrid you look at once and can not get out of your mind xiv hearing you praised is enough to make my overbaked brain a warpath for feuding goddesses only instead of swords their messages clash each one a model of what i might do on one side silence stately in black shows no sign of unrest her only response to the beaming crowd is to nod on the other side in see-through red a goddess named outrage deafens her rival with laudatory overdrive next to her encomia both clean and unclean the excesses of the laurel-throwers positively began to pale it is her manner that somehow filters out the walls start to rumble the floorboards feeble at keeping secrets murmur “ swear it. ” xv in the handed-down inventory of love ’ s habits we find images of lowering down at the mouth down on the knees prostrate with the shock of the marvelous contact more than shame-faced with the elevated figure is therefore impossible hazard more than a bow and a trapdoor opens beneath you offer a hand and see love disappear there is never a mention of the sudden boost the run-down ego receives when flinging a jest from toad-high levels it witnesses more than haughty approval nor is it told how the jest some minor impromptu line gets told and retold in the prolonged wake of the moment seraphs laugh at it trees love it you see your dullness shine in another ’ s eyes xvi a dream straight out of a textbook having been tied up and pointed at the wall by a swarthy hairy- faced thug and her henchman i hear the incredible shouts as an old babysitter is disemboweled severed organs flap to the floor like pancakes but i do not think “ me next ” fearing instead that it will fall on me to clean up the horrible mess what can i do on waking but clench my stomach in sharp instinctive need to keep it closed in wars between the hirsute and the nurturing nobody dares to cheer for the former though her company being moody is hellishly more alive will this day or the next bring pearly surfaces to the brink of spilling over somewhere the babysitter screams your name xvii once a day you report to the resident loony for clues leading to the whereabouts of the author of a love letter you have received she is mad but useful delving as she can into alternate worlds and as you grill her from the other side of the bars a strange bond begins to form between you she seems to have felt as you do little do you know that this sibyl is also a relentless self-promoter she ladles out counsel “ you can tell she wants to be tracked down ” and misinformation “ i think i know where she lives ” like a watery broth that keeps you coming back for the meaty pay-off at the bottom all this you realize and tolerate never suspecting that she ’ s the one you want xviii when you are within shouting distance it is no matter or next to none what you say or whether we speak at all it is enough to see and covertly to love your bright array of colorful traits they are no sooner parceled out than stored up secret accounts to be gone over until the whole single-spaced ledger is memorized but when you leave ledgers can not contain you time passes and the beloved blurs the riotous gestures faded in substance though not in force i can not hear your voice if i try and what do i do when a free-floating affection outraces its visible target from your splendid outpost that dazzles merely by being yours send photos xix abroad you are a mass of extra shadow falling on all you see on its own a square is stiff and formidable walk in it and the arches tremble the smells from the canal soften and linger the red of the hills at evening is fit for a postcard home until you step in the picture—and hand it back to the masters it is straight out of a shoddy french novel to squeeze the continents into us/them categories and chapters—mold here fruit there stubble in places and wheat in others think me less a philistine when i say how little the steps of the journey frame you it is you torchbearer to shrouded lands who flood them with living color xx when i call you to mind you respond sluggishly if at all it is as if being busy you send a very expensive mannequin in your stead a robot who dresses and walks like you but can not capture your puzzling essence memory loves paradox the more i require a stand-in the looser the seams the phonier the puppet but i do not know this until the unexpected happens sifting my horde of jewels and praising their cut i come upon a diamond that puts them to shame catching a glimpse of familiar patterns of color in the street i realize the cheapness of the household dolls i have been thinking about relieved that even now surprises like this put you fleetingly back in the picture xxi it will be objected that in missing you i forfeit a key to the room reserved for bona fide lovers there an air of resolute calm prevails it is always “ our minds are as one and that is enough ” or “ i saw him last night in the shape of a cloud ” or harder still to believe “ look at the useful machine i built instead of grieving. ” they may brace themselves and speak of the salubrious sublime they may grit their teeth and bear it their tourniqueted hearts are as undone as mine away you are no homing compass or dove but a roving ceaselessly altering scoundrel to miss you is to miss the loot you add to your repository of noises xxii horses birds babysitters and jails shadows churches and trains one would think you ’ d sat up with me all night filling out forms on what images you preferred or at least been consulted in the matter failing that one might suppose you to have stood on the sidelines in mounting horror as one by one strange pictures of you took flight but you stumbled into this mess of blocks like the bumbling idiot in a screwball comedy center stage contained in cardboard boxes you tripped over before smiling and wandering on in your madcap way to new scrapes meanwhile the whirligig thrives in your absence booted cubes swoon for their muse a poltergeist in a bowtie xxiii a spider loved a bee and knowing that to trap him would be to kill him devised webs just flashy enough to keep the insect guessing and soon seeing in the spider ’ s handiwork traces of his own flower-hopping the bee came closer arachnid vapors wafted over them as the bee proposed to die in the spider ’ s service “ no ” screamed the latter tightening up her floss and the spurned bee flew on to more accustomed turf—roses and lilies next to whom he saw the spider was nothing but she was not so lucky the web she ’ d spun for him got tangled in her post mortem antenna-flailing and finally wound around her neck and choked her it was the end of the fable xxiv the more love grows the bigger its sealed-off palace becomes and the more pinched and dark its stoical keeper inside sun breeds space a ray that snuck past the keeper enters a room and lights it— only now there is not one room but many beams bright as lasers but gentler give away the safe behind the painting the corridor under the rug if only the keeper hardened by circumstance could learn from this endless illumination and turn the room inside out light would then seep through leathery skin giving its secrets away in a gradually spreading glow turning skin the orange of pure beatitude but there are only two options for the keeper to be charbroiled all at once or eternally silent xxv then any enterprise requiring new clothes was privately hissed if openly hailed too close to a floral militia thinking as one were the standard frills the required rustles and thinking myself a beacon among dark ladies i called the clothes by their hidden agendas ethical corsets trusses of the spirit now i cry out for the colorful front of fancy dress bow down in belated awe before silk and organza it is not the delusion of being at my best but the promise of further secrecy that thrills me these veils only make unveiling all the stranger and wilder and under my gown claw ghosts you ’ ll never see xxvi this sideshow of outlandish images is nothing like the main attractions of another time just after one picture clicks on and the eyes have adjusted another altogether different one takes its place and another and another what in the world is going on did the projector gather together the uppermost slides on the pile nothing could be falser it is only that the replacement of the reel calls for as many tricks and turns as possible to be an even passable substitute everything is its field its lens is a gaping hole with a passion for things encyclopedic this is the only way it can capture your many angles—small comfort yet comfort still xxvii the next time our paths cross there will be none of this shilly-shallying this bondage like it or not to fickle time brute locale the crossing itself will slow down the march of the passing moment with its own unstoppable steam its tenebrous and sultry collection of vapors it will be love in a bottle but there is always a screw loose somewhere a gap in the glass that lets in a limber array of interlopers from the mutual friend who smells a levity and wants in to the premature bonging of the hour to the false confines of the walls of our houses there is always a damnable flaw in the system and incoming elves who taunt “ excuses excuses. ” xxviii what is it about this flame i label passion that burns the world and its newspapers to a crisp how can i call myself hungry for the facts of one kind but wince at another the lover ’ s room may be an all-white tiny room with a view of woods but why if a well-meaning friend slides a special report under my door do i look for tongs and a furnace because the flame is not only self-infatuated given to burning documents for the sake of flaunting its own reds but also in a state of permanent warfare all worldly flare-ups all currencies not its own remind it that amid the worst incendiary horrors it goes on stoking itself for want of a proper spark xxix the catechism of the far gone isn ’ t it too good to be coincidental that our eyes have looked at that billboard with the same unqualified disgust can we ignore the fact that you happened to witness the accident only minutes after i did is there more than just a flimsy link in a story jointly loved a pastime avoided no yes and by no means these are the very traits which observed in an enemy get shelved or denied by their once proud possessor i could pillage an igloo travel to the torrid antipodes and produce thousands like you featured like you like you in raves and complaints i was bedazzled by a ray of fool ’ s gold xxx go tyrant in your heart will nest no more desperate slaves come again days of productivity nights of rest and no nightmares i have spent so much time under the shade of your massive umbrella that i will draw it shut for a minute to see what i once saw and what i have missed since seeing you eyes look unchained around you it is a landscape of moldering stones and bones when the eyes are free to roam they are not so much free as useless—i see a sky of fledgling clouds and do nothing to help them peer into the living record of a severed oak and can decipher nothing return dark glasses come again morbid parasol only in shade do mountains have features xxxi in the final tally of divine overseers who will be ours suppose we claim the moon whose bottomless bag of stardust enchants a forest of two softens and shrinks the volume of venomous air between us and lovingly coats all former fears with beams of forgetful nourishing light our watcher is the moon but only after a brutal shake-up is through with her she has never learned the knack of lighting two people at once instead it is always me illumined you off in the bushes you posed in your halo me waist-deep in darkness and she is a clumsy goddess for the reason that she borrows poor moon what light she has from me xxxii though you are by definition a slippery freedom if forced to freeze you in a single image i would call you a beam of light with hidden powers to strike and alter forever here is a room regard its monotone grimness enter your incandescent highness gladly around you objects sparkle knowing a beam when they see it next to your flawless arc i am a damaged bulb in a fleabag hotel clattering on to reveal paintings on velvet and objets trouvés but where rattling off to plunge the run-down room into dark desuetude what if we pooled our forces would we stand together like heartless neon sculpture or deck ourselves in loving chiaroscuro xxxiii perfect you say it is enough to make me perform operations on myself in order to test your love taking in the wreckage you would be forced to say “ yes gouging out one eye makes the other shine all the brighter the smell of your fungus reminds me of summer your leprous stump is a modish charmer since after all green is my favorite color. ” and yet for all our tirades against deception how easily do we succumb to the lover ’ s flattery and with what treachery if i am perfect it is only by being perfect that you myopic dependable you can keep me so go on keep on calling me faultless come on hurry up with my supper leave me and come back at midnight but don ’ t come back if you hear a noise in the room xxxiv still the inveterate skulker the ghost of chaos past i have come back to the place where it all began where leaving you gave me leave to see you wherever i went— in the home in the wild in the sky in the gutter— and where columns scribbled on and abandoned took one look at my raving and rose again strangest of all is that given the chance to see my subject in the fabulous flesh at last i would flatly refuse these barren days when i heat my room by the fading coals of my goals this ache for an ache is as good as it gets so go on running i will go on looking for you as the willow bends as the stomach hunts for the ulcer
beloved men in thick green coats came crunching through the snow the insignia on their shoulders of uncertain origin a country i could not be sure of a salute so terrifying i heard myself lying to avoid arrest and was arrested along with jocko whose tear had snapped off a tiny icicle he put in his mouth we were taken to the ice prison a palace encrusted with hoarfrost its dome lit from within jocko admired the wiring he kicked the walls to test the strength of his new boots a television stood in a block of ice its blue image still moving like a liquid center you asked for my innermost thoughts i wonder will i ever see a grape again when i think of the vineyard where we met in october—when you dropped a cluster custom insisted you be kissed by a stranger—how after the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms turned pink it seemed our future was sealed everyone said so it is quiet here not closing our ranks weakens us hugely the snowflakes fall in a featureless bath i am the stranger who kissed you on sunny days each tree is a glittering chandelier the power of mindless beauty jocko told a joke and has been dead since may a bullethole in his forehead the officers call a third eye for a month i milked a barnful of cows it is a lot like cleansing a chandelier wipe and polish wipe and polish round and round you go i have lost my spectacles is the book i was reading still open by the side of our bed treat it as a bookmark saving my place in our story here the letter breaks off
a boy from brooklyn used to cruise on summer nights as soon as he ’ d hit sixty he ’ d hold his hand out the window cupping it around the wind he ’ d been assured this is exactly how a woman ’ s breast feels when you put your hand around it and apply a little pressure now he knew and he loved it night after night again and again until the weather grew cold and he had to roll the window up for many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting to soar one winter ’ s night holding his wife ’ s breast in his hand he closed his eyes and wanted to weep he loved her but it was the wind he imagined now as he grew older he loved the word etcetera and refused to abbreviate it he loved sweet white butter he often pretended to be playing the organ on one of his last mornings he noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow he shook it out but the next morning it reappeared
the curve of her hip where i ’ d lay my head that ’ s what i ’ m thinking of now her fingers gone slow through my hair on a blue day ten thousand miles off in the future somewhere where the beer is so cold it sweats in your hand cool as her kissing you with crushed ice her tongue wet with blackberry and melon that ’ s what i ’ m thinking of now because i ’ m all out of adrenaline all out of smoking incendiaries somewhere deep in the landscape of the brain under the skull ’ s blue curving dome— that ’ s where i am now swaying in a hammock by the water ’ s edge as soldiers laugh and play volleyball just down the beach while others tan and talk with the nurses who bring pills to help them sleep and if this is crazy then let this be my sanatorium let the doctors walk among us here marking their charts as they will i have a lover with hair that falls like autumn leaves on my skin water that rolls in smooth and cool as anesthesia birds that carry all my bullets into the barrel of the sun
both lying on our sides making love in spoon position when she ’ s startled what ’ s that she means the enormous ship passing before you— maybe not that large is it a freighter or a passenger ship but it seems huge in the dark and it ’ s so close that ’ s a poem you say d. h. lawrence—have you built your ship of death have you o build your ship of death for you will need it right here it would be good if there were a small orchestra on board you ’ d hear them and say to her that piece is called autumn that ’ s what the brave musicians played as the titanic went under—and then you could name this poem “ autumn. ” but no the ship is silent its white lights glow in the darkness
i have had to write this down in my absence and yours these things happen thinking of a voice added i imagine a sympathy outside us that protects the message from what can ’ t help being said the times you ’ ve kept your secret putting on glasses or glancing into a page with interest give again the hurt you ’ ve forgiven pretending to be one of us so the hope of love translates as a series of hidden moments where we like to think someone was fooled into it who was i then who filled these days with illegible warnings the marriages broken the land pillaged by speculators no word for a stranger this island where i thought the language was mine has left me lonely and innocent as you or that friend who let you copy his themes until the words became pictures of places you would never go forgive it then that so much of after depends on these the words which must find you off the page
in the bath i look up and see the brown moth pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips against the white wall i heat up the water running as much hot in as i can stand these handfuls over my shoulder—how once he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring we were drinking from beautiful mischief that stills a moment so i can never look back only now brightest now and the water never hot enough to drive that shiver out but i remember solitude—no other presence and each thing what it was not this raw fluttering i make of you as you have made of me your watch-fire your killing light
that linkage of warnings sent a tremor through june as if to prepare october in the hardest apples one week in late july we held hands through the bars of his hospital bed our sleep made a canopy over us and it seemed i heard its durable roaring in the companion sleep of what must have been our bedouin god and now when the poppy lets go i know it is to lay bare his thickly seeded black coach at the pinnacle of dying my shaggy ponies heard the shallow snapping of silk but grazed on down the hillside their prayer flags tearing at the void—what we stared into its cool flux of blue and white how just shaking at flies they sprinkled the air with the soft unconscious praise of bells braided into their manes my life simplified to “ for him ” and his thinned like an injection wearing off so the real gave way to the more-than-real each moment ’ s carmine abundance furl of reddest petals lifted from the stalk and no hint of the black hussar ’ s hat at the center by then his breathing stopped so gradually i had to brush lips to know an ending tasting then that plush of scarlet which is the last of warmth kissless kiss he would have given mine to extend a lover ’ s right past its radius to give and also most needfully my gallant hussar to bend and take
that whine is the sound of waste rot the frantic grinding inability to attend to anything but sere thwarting of yourself a dry corrosion which some say they know but you and i— my jaw clenched as you turn a page you with a heart like drywall i who would lace my arms with razors then press them slowly to your lips the metal taste mixing with flesh and through gritted teeth i making the sound of you you you do not know meaning only me me we know best

i ’ ve often wondered why she laughed on thinking why i wondered so it seemed such waste that long white hands should touch my hands and let them go and once when we were parting there unseen of anything but trees i touched her fingers thoughtfully for more than simple niceties but for some futile things unsaid i should say all is done for us yet i have wondered how she smiled beholding what was cavernous
though half my years besiege the aged sun i have not lived my robust preparation lags tardily behind fit consummation droops sweatily in courses just begun oh i have loved and lusted with the best plucked momentary music from the senses i ’ ve kissed a lip or two with fair pretenses and wept for softness of a woman ’ s breast my mind rebounds to nether joys and pain toying with filth and pharisaic leaven i know the lift up sundry peaks to heaven and every rockless path to hell again i wait the hour when gods have more to give than husks and bare insatiate will to live
in a pyloned desert where the scorpion reigns my love and i plucked poppies breathing tales of crimes now long asleep whose once–red stains dyed stabbing men at sea with bloody sails the golden sand drowsed there a dog yelped loud and in his cry rattled a hollow note of deep uncanny knowledge of that crowd that loved and bled in winy times remote the poppies fainted when the moon came wide the cur lay still our passionate review of red wise folly dreamed on she by my side stared at the moon and then i knew he knew and then he smiled at her to him ’ twas funny— her calm steel eyes her earth–old throat of honey
are you shaken are you stirred by a whisper of love spellbound to a word does time cease to move till her calm grey eye expands to a sky and the clouds of her hair like storms go by then the lips that you have kissed turn to frost and fire and a white-steaming mist obscures desire so back to their birth fade water air earth and the first power moves over void and dearth is that love no but death a passion a shout the deep in-breath the breath roaring out and once that is flown you must lie alone without hope without life poor flesh sad bone
o you who came upon me once stretched under apple-trees just after bathing why did you not strangle me before speaking rather than fill me with the wild white honey of your words and then leave me to the mercy of the forest bees
i cut myself upon the thought of you and yet i come back to it again and again a kind of fury makes me want to draw you out from the dimness of the present and set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses then going obviously to inhale their fragrance i touch the blade of you and cling upon it and only when the blood runs out across my fingers am i at all satisfied
my love is in a light attire among the apple trees where the gay winds do most desire to run in companies there where the gay winds stay to woo the young leaves as they pass my love goes slowly bending to her shadow on the grass and where the sky ’ s a pale blue cup over the laughing land my love goes lightly holding up her dress with dainty hand

she stepped into the tub at dawn and turned on first the radio and then the tap the predator operators of nellis afb have as much or more ptsd as pilots who fly down the hall and oceans distant i listened to her work to wash events away as quickly as they accumulated a sort of race i thought of where the soap was going targets glowed on monitors in the base ’ s trailers near las vegas and operators in full flight suits drank coffee from paper cups and adjusted altitude as i stroked myself beneath the blankets i don ’ t like to take chances and haven ’ t been to vegas in years the pilots call people who run for cover black sperm writhing across their screens “ squirters. ” near my finish line she tugged up the puckered rubber no-slip safety mat the sound should remind you of a time a doctor took hold of your arm for comfort or leverage and tore the bandage off if nothing like this has happened to you imagine it the haberdasher in diderot who stole his wife ’ s dowry long story plans to leave paris for geneva sensing distance will make him less guilty she wasn ’ t coming back to bed she may already have left villagers call the drones which make a buzzing sound “ wasps. ” the radio reported to an empty room “ an assassin ” writes diderot “ if transported to the shores of china will lose sight of the corpse he left bleeding on the banks of the seine. ” asia ’ s always such a great place to hide but geneva ’ s obviously more convenient say she expected her husband to return from duty in a month would anything we did between now and then make us any more or less wretched than we were the drone returns to bagram without the missiles it left with and a soldier restores its complement either his name is dan or else imagine that and that a cuckold ’ s rage can snuff a bomb i came into either a tissue or my fist this was weeks or months ago and i can ’ t recall when de castañeda and his men clambered down into the grand canyon in 1540 they found the boulders which had looked as tall as a man from the rim in fact stood taller than seville ’ s la giralda they must have marveled at distance ’ s power to deceive and to wake deception ’ s twin oblivion their women and homes forgotten you can ’ t hear their screams from here but they ’ re there

you can ’ t trust lesbians you invite them to your party and they don ’ t come they ’ re too busy tending vaginal flowers hating football walking their golden and chocolate labs x gave me a poem in which she was in love with a woman and the church but the church couldn ’ t accept four breasts in one bed when i asked if our coworkers knew she dropped her head and i said nothing for years until this morning i realized no one reads poems my secrets and hers are safe in verse i knew she ’ d have enjoyed the beaujolais and i want to meet dianne mona lisa betty alice the name ’ s been changed to protect women who can ’ t stand in a room holding hands because you can ’ t trust heterosexuals to love love however it comes so i recorded the party for her for them the mic a bit away from the action to catch the feel of waves touching shore and letting go the wash of moods across the hours of drink and yes some grapes were thrown and i breathed the quickening revelation of a cigarette someone said “ i gave up underwear for lent ” and i hope they play the tape while making love as if finally the world ’ s made happy by who they are laughing with not at the nipple lick clit kiss hug in bed and after the on and on of meals and moons and bills and burning days of pretending they don ’ t exist “ who ’ s she just a friend. ” and oceans are merely dew upon the land
the strings as if they knew the lovers are about to meet begin to soar and when he marches in the door they soar some more—half ecstasy half pain the musical equivalent of rain— while children who have grown up with one stare steal further looks across a crowded room as goners tend to do my father loved it too warned me at dinner that he ’ d be a wreck long before the final trio came ja ja she sighed and gave him up forever he found his sophie better late than never and took the fifth about his silent tears but like him i ’ m a softie with a massive gift for feeling blue i went with others threw bouquets and caution to the whirling wind believing that the rhapsody on stage would waft its wonders up to our cheap seats but mirrors can be beautiful fierce cheats delusions of an over-smitten mind i relished trouser roles until i had no petals left to strew up down the avenue i wandered like a ghost i wondered why a miracle is always a mirage then plodded home and set back all the clocks spent hard-won funds installing strong new locks telling myself if violence like this could never sound like violins i would to art not life be true and i am trying to fathom the way i got from there to here the joy that snuck up when i ’ d sworn off joy we ’ ve made a sterling start we ’ ve got a plan to watch it on your satin couch downtown and i ’ ll be there upon the stroke of eight bearing in my trembling ungloved hand a silver rose for you

the world had fled with all its silly cares and questionable aches and in one swoon we rose above its stupefying airs like flying lovesick pigs up to the moon in that blue light where two lives equaled all our souls looked down upon a spinning ball the world returned and this was a surprise i raged against like someone on a rack telling the sun tears clouding my stunned eyes give us our splendid isolation back i craved third rails a shot of something strong when i found out it doesn ’ t last for long the world came back and stayed pain never ended but when the aches and cares begged for a hand grew softer in the light we ’ d made and tended i finally began to understand love ’ s widening third stage and of the three this was the most outstanding ecstasy

these ghost soldiers live underground with the vast oversupply of castoff lanterns if one were to take broadsword to one of these orange-bearded mammoth men of rough hew he would laugh at the passing metal make light of entrails for years i have been here without a clear map that hopes should dim as days go on above is natural i suppose what do i know i am dressed like one of them the thick walls quake but stay soundproof i fear my fists vestigial these soldiers ’ own panic is taking up rugs finding filigrees of the former world beneath e.g. a locket with their mongrel ’ s mush they will freeze then feign noncom smacking barrels of burgundy with pistol butts i react comme squirrel fleeing their reach to the chamber out of the impact area one loved me until i asked if he worried about what must be happening without us well his lips did narrow hand abandoned my knee blah blah big mouth were his departing words i will not say with shame that i came from nothing someone paved my first breakthrough at least one time calling it love and i will stand by that as it applies to my primary makeup
i there has never been sunlight for this love like a crazed flower it buds in the dark is at once a crown of thorns and a spring garland around the temples a fire a wound the bitterest of fruit but a breeze as well a source of water your breath—a bite to the soul your chest—a tree trunk in the current make me walk on the turbid waters be the ax that breaks this lock the dew that weeps from trees if i become mute kissing your thighs it ’ s that my heart eagerly searches your flesh for a new dawn
xii once again i look out your window and the world looks oddly different maybe the fields have blossomed or perhaps more stars have been born delirious waves caress my feet something new unknown sunsets whisper in my ear as well everywhere i find your odor your shape you are among old-growth pines in the fog along the coastal rocks around the most somber of afternoons impossible to wipe away your job from my eyes from my sad mouth— you are the universe made flesh
the heart dies without space for love without a moral horizon think of it then as a bird trapped in a box my heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence only toward them can one really advance that is make progress without them i feel i ’ m half a person romeo was born a montague and juliet came from the capulet line and i ’ m a disciple of shakespeare not ben gurion— therefore i ’ ll be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of haidar abdel shafi i mean this of course as a parable only—but the parable is my measure and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair this isn ’ t just some idle fancy that out of poetic license i place our fate in my daughter ’ s sex that i grant myself this imaginary gift testifies to the extent to which we ’ re living still in the underworld where we ’ re granted the hope and potential of an amoeba but all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl spring out of the ground and devour each other until a sacred union occurs healing the breach in the world the arab groom from gaza too will extend to my daughter a dress on which is embroidered the land redeemed from apartheid ’ s curse— our land as a whole belonging equally to all of its offspring and then he ’ ll lift the veil from her face and say to her “ and now i take you to be my wife lotem abdel shafi ”

i. one reason to eat is to not speak said the man with a mouth full of food when she told me that my silence was worse than her silence i agreed even though she was wrong it is shallow to fight for things he said but sometimes it can be fun you look like a tunnel she said and kissed my lips what i like least about words is their capacity to invoke more words she said as she trashed my poem according to the new york times gay teenage boys want monogamy while heterosexual boys prefer “ friends with benefits. ” my psychiatrist told me it was okay to lie about the important details of my life as a result i fell in love with her i stopped seeing her as a patient but when we dated the spark was gone if as cioran writes existing is plagiarism then what is death i was lost all night in the forest only to discover these were streets i knew quite well in the oresteia apollo argues that the true parent is “ he who mounts. ” because the furies fail to ask what happens when the woman is on top they lose the case in evaluations a student wrote “ daniel would be a better teacher if he wasn ’ t such an asshole. ” weren ’ t such an asshole i wanted to tell her though as her comments were supposed to be anonymous i could not admit that i recognized her handwriting on a first date i innocently went to the bathroom when the check arrived she thought i was trying to stick her with the bill but when she realized i was unaware of dating etiquette she was charmed we had a nice kiss goodnight but afterwards i was so flustered i went to a bar by myself drank whiskey and smoked my first cigarette in years ii throughout my life i have always wanted to tell the truth even though i knew it was all a lie in the end all that matters is the truth content of a lie —thomas bernhard gathering evidence before i met lisa in person says jerry a user of an online dating service i really enjoyed the wit and flirtatiousness of her emails but on our first date she was stiff as a board i wasn ’ t attracted to her though i slept with her anyway just in case i might like it and i did i liked it so much that now we ’ re getting married i love you she said as she smacked her child ’ s head i love you for your holes she said not just the holes in your shoes and socks but the gaping holes in your personality when she asked me if i was uncomfortable i told her i wasn ’ t i really was uncomfortable what i neglected to say was that i enjoy being uncomfortable two old friends meet in a café to discuss mutual funds and stock options thus begins a story that ends with one man slicing off the other ’ s neck and stuffing his mouth with love poems to young werther life is too short to be genuine he said as he stared into her deep brown eyes it was the most genuine thing he ’ s said all day

after raymond carver ’ s hummingbird suppose i said the word “ springtime ” and i wrote the words “ king salmon ” on a piece of paper and mailed it to you when you opened it would you remember that afternoon we spent together in the yellow boat when the early whales were feeding and we caught our first fish of the year or would you remember that time off cape flattery when you were a little girl your father smoking telling stories as he ran the boat then the tug and zing of that very first fish spooling off into the gray-green world you laughing and brushing back your hair before setting the hook i know i am hard to understand sometimes particularly when you are standing at the post office with only a piece of paper saying “ king salmon ” on it but just think of it as a promissary note and that electric tug that thrill pulling your mind into deep water is how i feel about you every single day

i ’ m alone until i ’ m asleep and there you are naked you take my hand shhhh we tiptoe through a black-blue meadow to the pond behind the farmhouse the farmer sleeps in the blind window no cicadas even maybe just maybe venus — this is before wednesday everything ’ s alright we tiptoe ‘ round the house as around a painful subject — we ’ re at the pond and now it ’ s time to use vague holy-man speech like i am another face in your hand the face of your eye — wing-surrogates the word bones — it ’ s time for afternoon them white-blank architectures no veil nothing ’ s glistening christmas christmas it ’ s time for you to forgive me i was forced to eat valises that wouldn ’ t close by themselves — that was just a dream good morning regurgitate the stars and the soot
there was a time when i watched it happen strangers pressed to other strangers in one bed clothes on air humid with the cloying scent of fruit juice and vodka none of us giving into another and yet unwilling to leave the scene of that possibility pretending to sleep actually sleeping then waking again to slip a hand over a shoulder slide a finger inside the waistband of a skirt so young we are even now still so young in that hotel room turning blue then lighter blue we wouldn ’ t have tried for more the kiss the button firm white shape of an image slipped wholly into the mind acted upon dreamed upon filling the thin vessels of the lungs earlier a film its forced sounds of lovemaking the tension i felt winding into the muscles of some of the others in the room i remember i left for awhile we all left for awhile even the music was frightening how to strip ourselves like that point at the places that were wanted plucked and peeled speaking the words hearing them form us the nature of what we were and could do to each other the music the rocking the sobbing the man called the woman by parts of herself some laughed at this i remember i must have been one of them in the morning the hotel room was turning white after the long night hands were slipping and unslipping moving over the flattened pillows as if in hopes something small could still satisfy us someone turned and looked at someone else we all heard it legs shifted sheets slid themselves down waists or shoulders tightened again at the necks of those pretending to sleep as the unblinking sun crawled in our window from another room coughing we all heard it someone looked at someone else the room turned white the air began clearing
yesterday everything was possible today we ’ re good as married you don ’ t want to hear that do you thinking i ’ m going to call you back in from the rain to fight over the morning paper limning my deft and emotional promiscuities that we ’ ll sit in our sitting room watching the shaggy junipers twirl in winter wind as a storm closes its throat around the city i ’ m thinking about how to ask god to be nicer i ’ m thinking about that fabled leper colony where the last solitary patient waited inside its unlocked tower three years in the belief she could not step outside and how the local doctors visited only to re-wrap her face to brush out her last gold strands of hair wondering how to save anybody so willing to kill herself with denial they wanted to talk about pain the doctors to say one day you ’ ll be half asleep in the dark listening to a radio play in another room and feel yourself suddenly filling like a jug with the cold awareness nothing more will ever happen the disaster of your old ambivalence the familiarity of desire ’ s wolfish teeth sinking into the body the body as if it didn ’ t belong to you anymore the doctors said fear should never be elevated to ritual they told the woman you must change your life one day i ’ m on the steps of an office tower losing a shoe the next i ’ m screaming on a gurney i ’ m stuffing a baby into a diaper i ’ m wondering the woods in my scar-dark cape every story has an archetype doesn ’ t it and if so why aren ’ t we married why can ’ t we be just like everyone else this fucking fucking once god i hate the way this tale is turning out two aged strangers learning to tuck in their blood hiding the knives and bread crumbs deep inside their pockets look this time i swear i won ’ t run really i ’ ll come and go from my stone room without a mirror all my extremities taped in white i ’ ll learn to knit with three fingers i ’ ll learn to read into the deepening silences to be nice to your step-sisters singing to drown out the tears of their ugliness i love you can i even say that in this story i want to spend the rest of my life growing quietly bored with you locking away loom and spindle sweeping out the piles of rose petals and ash for once i plan to triumph over smug experience i marry you don ’ t hit me please just come in from the stars awhile sit here in this sitting room let me find you another section of the paper to argue over the doctors said i get to wear a suit they said i ’ ll be released next thursday listen even now the junipers are whispering their dark good-byes thin limbs smocked in white a riderless horse has appeared on the horizon and somewhere out in the meretricious night somebody ’ s life is quietly changing
it ’ s a simple resistance between the pull of springs and struggle of joints two coiled silver muscles working in the lamp against blue washers and pivot plates locking nut coolly swiveling loose with age in the arm it ’ s done with blood tissues plumped then promptly deflated what else am i supposed to start with not the light bulb to which this whole narrative yearns loving the glass envelope sizzling with light grasshopper antennae scrubbed with electricity until each filament ’ s turned to fire no i have to start with the arm first the mint-blue lamp then maybe light itself to specify what startles me about you globe of hot fruit christ heart throbbing in the open chest curtains of robe parted just enough to see what afterglow defines us waits for us rubbing its slow music out into the wet dark— tonight i ’ m counting out my seeds of waiting for you through a current that is silent and might always be though it thrums in every gesture like this white eye burning within the metal shade i carefully adjust over a plate of orange slices each evening
the tuba wakes before the man it ’ s a content animal having no word for the moment suits it fine it looks at him with a dun and smooth interiority as a glass of rum might or a worn number on an apartment building his hands crossed on the chest rise and fall with breathing in the dream he ’ s ringing the bell now climbing unlocking the door peering into a glass the flat is empty is the war over yet or was he here before the war soon dropping salt levels will wake him— in tears with an odd groove in his palm as though he ’ d held on to an instrument for hours for a good minute he ’ ll be nameless and when a name does come it won ’ t be his humming in thought the bright last name he rang on the doorbell he ’ ll see in a certain abrupt sunlight he ’ d chosen her then— to be able to call everything something
it was when they determined that i had been born dead that my life became easier to understand for a long time i wondered why rooms felt colder when i entered them why nothing i said seemed to stick in anyone ’ s ear frankly why i never had any money i wondered why the cities i walked through drifted into cloud even as i admired their architecture as i pointed out the cornerstones marked “ 1820 ” “ 1950. ” the only songs i ever loved were filled with scratch dispatches from a time when dead ones like me were a dime a dozen i spent my life in hotels some looked like mansions some more like trailer parks or pathways toward a future i tried to point to but how could i point with nothing but a hand no hand ever matched with fingers that melted into words that no one read i rehearsed names that others taught me caravaggio robert brandom judith amber emmanuelle cat i got hungry the way only the dead get hungry the hunger that launches a thousand dirty wars but i never took part in the wars because no one lets a dead man into their covert discussions so i drifted from loft to cellar ageless like a ghost and america became my compass and europe became the way that dead folks talk in short who cares there ’ s nothing to say because nobody listens there ’ s no radio for the dead and the pillows seem like sand let me explain when you ’ re alive as i understand it pillows cushion the head the way a lover might soothe the heart the way it works for me in contrast is everything is sand beds are sand the women i profess to love are sand the sound of music in the darkest night is sand and whatever i have to say is sand this is not for example a political poem because the dead have no politics they might have a hunger but nothing you ’ ve ever known could begin to assuage it
the last line should strike like a lover ’ s complaint you should never see it coming and you should never hear the end of it
little patches of grass disappear in the jaws of lusty squirrels who slip into the spruce cars collapse into parts spring dissolves into summer the kitten into the cat a tray of drinks departs from the buffet and voilà the party ’ s over all that ’ s left are some pickles and a sprig of wilting parsley on the rug when i think of all those gong-tormented mesozoic seas i feel a ripple of extinction and blow a smoke ring through the trees soon there will be nothing left here but sky when i think about the fact i am not thinking about you it is a new way of thinking about you

love lasts by not lasting —jack gilbert i ’ m mapping this new year ’ s vanishings lover yellow house the knowledge of surfaces this is not a story of return there are times i wish i could erase the mind ’ s lucidity the difficulty of sundays my fervor to be touched by a woman two februarys gone what brings the body back grieved and cloven tromping these woods with nothing to confide in new snow reassumes the circleting trees the bridge above the creek where i stand like a stranger to my life there is no single moment of loss there is an amassing the disbeliever sleeps at an angle in the bed the orchard is a graveyard is this the real end someone shoveling her way out with cold intention someone naming her missing

sometimes it takes miles to give up resistance though the mirror shows a body unresisting shows perhaps something to admire others may a body without difficulty loosening breaking its own willfulness cracking itself like a rusted bolt that finally begins to turn a body that turns toward openness fantasy those desires of and not of the body sometimes i notice a powerful man engaged steadily repeating difficult action folding himself his tight skin over and over lifting a declined torso or pulling up a suspended trunk and think how neat how controlled to be inside that body i struggle not to stare grip myself not to lose myself inside the thought of being inside that body i can never get there i know because it is the image i want the veneer of muscle having taken primacy from mind now first among equals bicep abdominal quadricep the launch after launch of a perpetual run i want the image even when i am it or nearly it— because even then i am also that other thing self-conscious burdened struggling for movement if there is a link between god and animals— the way he identifies with the so much that isn ’ t us as he had to have to have made them— it must be in the body enacting will immediate through movement as if with a word creating a world enacting creation immediate through speech which is to say this is my time of prayer my only time miles in as long as it takes for the body to relinquish resistance bright public surrounded by others who move toward better movement and all the while seeing in a wall of mirrors that image of myself deer horse running close kin to breathing motion necessary to survival perfect image of a man that i ’ m merely a self-conscious copy of i pray for things of course for myself and for those whose pain touches me selfish and unselfish prayers for intimates and strangers i pray for the runner in the mirror too sleek easy animal unselfconscious and present and absent as a god the man who could almost be me who i do my best to rush toward i pray that one day by his grace we may meet
always the script the dramatic comma the pointed ellipsis half turn beat the exit itself as punctuation let ’ s say the back wall of the house fell away first cracks down the plaster then it crumbles to reveal seventy-five rows of spectators that ’ s the explanation they ’ ve been there all along i mulled blocking on a blind impulse but it turns out a correct one maybe someone is making love to me in the 19th century sense do i throw off his hand exit with pithy wit or simply submit to it the sappy moment which will i know have to be resisted in some later scene had i been there had it been me i would have said— and the audience would have been moved to applaud astounding improvisation i ’ d have walked right up to the lawyer the bank manager and i ’ d have said— or if it was me it would never have gotten that far i ’ d have turned to her and said— so i am contemplating in its shade an apple tree haven ’ t i often done that so why not me late august the leaves like arrowheads dark green waxy punctuated by apples—constellations of apples there i see the hunter bow pulled back the apples of his quiver fixed with perfect aim william tell daughter across the tree of apples herself poised with a perfect fruit above her head wet tension of its surface red skin that kisses the sun and this perfect tree this perfect tree in which every stamen was touched by pollen in which every flower thickened to fruit tree that knows by its own example perfection in each cluster five apples bunch as tight as chambers of a human heart had i been there had it been me—and the slither up the trunk brought my attention low the rippling body sliding along the trunk i who have been so good all these years at resisting and giving in and resisting— i ’ d have heard the melodious hiss seen the glinting tongue its fork invading the region of my heart the archer in that perfect canopy aiming right at me i who have given in to desire when the stakes were much lower could i resist those movements how fully the serpent ’ s hiss gives itself over to simile i am like i am like i am like seen it before mister i ’ d have sighed in an aside glanced up at the sky deadpanned the audience and said— or had my lover brought the apple for years i have told them not to burn money on me but to bring only this to hold it out with a silent smile as they enter the house down center on the stage of the palm no better way to say i love you so why not me early october the outsize hunger after running and my lover brings it over i recognize on his breath the scent of the serpent and the apple the one forbidden thing deep voice dark eyes silent smile and perfect apple only midday draped across his body tight alert alive to the moment of sin and reaching out to take it in my hand who better than me let the tension linger let the audience pulse with anticipation we touch over the forbidden fruit the stage lights dim and i look at him and i look at him and raise my eyebrows and say— but even so wouldn ’ t i end up here again always here angels crossing swords behind me shame clothing me conflating all my losses—the loss of god the loss of apples how they expand inside to fill up hunger maybe there are no words here just the sky blackening with anger maybe words wouldn ’ t be useful here anyway consider a scrim the night sky blotted of constellations nothing but gray swirls of wrath and project against it a man ’ s silhouette head bent empty- handed the memory of apples imprinted on his wordless tongue and around his neck loss—like a cowbell—announcing his presence to the fallen world
eloquent silence of everyone i ever loved this cloudy friday evening spring but still cold a smattering of new buds who 's that swaddled in the uneasy atmosphere in silence no chatter or pleasant surprise the lusty rush of a weekend with the beloved who 's that sprouting now out of the cottony silence with silky whips still hanging from their little chops who is it straining to pop out of the hardwood rings of time into the cool air like there 's another cool world on the other side of this one worth pushing through to or maybe we 're already there is that why we shake
why are you bugging me you stank minuscule husk of musk muster deliberation crawling over reasons and possessions i have have not touched should i fail in my insecticide i pray for a black boy who lifts you to a flame with bedeviled tweezers until mercy rises disappears you are the size of a stuttering drop of liquid — milk machine oil semen blood yes you funky stud you are the jewel in the knob of an elegant butt plug snug between pleasure disgust you are the scent of rot at the heart of lovemaking the meat inside your exoskeleton is as tender as jesus neruda wrote of “ a nipple perfuming the earth. ” yes you are an odor an almost imperceptible ode to death a lousy stinking stinkbug
i sit on the couch witness my life projected on a screen — i am white w/a chiseled dimpled chin no lips i ’ m a farmer who lives alone in a loft not a lowly office worker who lives w/a roommate in an apartment where dust balls decorate the floors walls the ceiling rings w/children ’ s feet running back forth like baby bulls i am crazy enough to be a contestant on a show where i ’ m contractually obligated to propose to a woman who believes in a heteronormative patriarchal idea of what a family should be at the end of every episode i offer roses to those i wish to make out w/more take out on prepackaged romantic dates i could never afford on my bachelor budget for example a date in a castle a glass slipper prop a clock winding its way down to midnight my date i sip champagne chat eat then we dance to a live orchestra led by a maestro who wishes he were dead a giant screen appears plays a clip of a live-action cinderella movie w/prince charming played by an actor i ’ ve seen slaughter behead a soldier like clipping the head off a rose in real life my dates consist of dinner at burger king where we dine on chicken fries don paper crowns for a royal feel on another show date i take two women into south dakota where we fly over the heads of white slave owners carved into a sacred native mountain at the end of the date i offer no roses to either woman abandon them on a canopied bed in the middle of the badlands take off in a helicopter to provide the cameras an aerial view of wilderness despair at the end of the show i find myself proposing to a fertility nurse in a barn made to look like a chapel not the place where i raised my first horse fucked my first goat here i will milk the cows for our future offspring to drink straight from the teat like i did as a kid the show ends i rise from the couch walk into the kitchen on bended knee i reach for a bottle of beer deep in the back of the fridge pop the top like a question take a swig cold crisp once it hits my full lips
we ’ re talking about when we met and you say it was easier to fall for me thinking i ’ ll remember this pause it was likely i ’ d be dead by now talking falling thinking waiting have i undone what you ’ ve tried to do you say no you say the surprise of still being is something being built— the machine of our living this saltwork of luck stylish safe comfortable and unintended meanwhile i haven ’ t had the opportunity to tell you but our lovely little dog has just killed a possum maybe it ’ s unfair a possum entering the argument here but i lay it down before us because an ugly dying possum played dead and didn ’ t run its dubious cunning was brought to an end outside our door by our brutal beautiful and very pleased little dog so how do i say that this is not about death or sadness or even whether you really first loved me waiting thinking i ’ d be dying young it ’ s just that standing there a few minutes ago holding a dead possum by its repellent bony tail i was struck by how eerily pleased i was to be a spectator to teeth spit agony and claw feeling full of purpose thinking how different in our adversaries we are from possums we try love— the fist of words their opening hand and whether we play dead or alive our pain the slow circulation of happiness our salt and work the stubborn questions we endlessly give names to haunt us with choice
sometimes in time ’ s near unassailable sangfroid there is a thawing the memory asserts its musicality again reminds one that it is at heart heart ’ s artificer somewhere in okinawa there are stairs “ my husband is the only constant in ” are concrete stairs that lead one or at least led me age six near straight from top to bottom of a cliff face they ended in a black-sand beach “ the only constant in my life when i was young i would have thought i would regret it to have wrapped myself up like a caterpillar in a man—but if my name like his is vogelsang then i must half recede with him only half of me is julia and that fades too so call me if you call me mrs. vogelsang. ” at that age having lived before in florida it seemed like a miraculous affront that a beach could shuffle off the purity of sand satisfying to have seen it after the descent of stairs at least three hundred each laborious at six my body hardly large enough to bear its density in time— knowing little still i felt exhilaration that a new piece of world would stand if briefly out of time therefore out of me if i am what i occupy of it the body hates to be discounted in this way says it encloses any love the heart pretends to like the stairs a downward tedium but still the necessary setting of the beach as gems are set in rings that though of precious metals lack the brilliance of the gems go unnoticed though they lift the whole from what it risks— “ at the onset of my husband ’ s impotence i thought myself in part if not entirely responsible i ascribed the blame to our admittedly unsensational sex habits to our bed not cold perhaps but let ’ s be frank a little bored with us therefore thirty-eight only just confronted with my inexperience that bordered on extended childhood i contemplated then resolved to take his penis in my mouth it was not lightly i decided this i am perhaps anachronistic—though no prude my husband i if you will excuse vulgarity fucked constantly when young not infrequently until this roadblock—but it struck me somehow as unseemly hitherto my husband when i told him what i meant to do looked pleased as though decorum only kept him twenty years long from requesting it he tried to guide me as i started both his hands like tethers not unkind to what they hold— and he was kind to me spoke kindly as i ran my tongue across him tasting faintly of his sweat but not unpleasant on the whole not bad to do this though my faith flagged somewhat as his prick lay flaccid in my mouth its stubbornness infuriating i could feel his disappointment selfish maybe but no more so than is fair in love for he of course was not a stranger to this act no sense in skipping what embarrasses i knew at least once in the time since our marriage he had been with someone else though it had been a while by now she had told me long my friend full of guilt i told her bitterness was foreign to me which is almost true that she shouldn ’ t worry though i ’ d rather that she not encourage him to seek a second tryst not much by then that i could do to change what they had done— i believed at that time as i said i was responsible could mend it so he ’ d never feel the need to cheat again can ’ t know now whether i was right though sometimes i consider asking him—as i considered then but as i built my courage up he stiffened and i threw my heart into the act as one who plows the earth with spite for it his anger lightening his labor that the ground break open for his putting in the seed i will not lie fallow always though my body rot —the thick warmth running in my mouth like bitter salt dissolved in water like the ocean beautiful though full of bloated fish. ” looking at the ocean it does not at first cohere the waves seem merely limits that the eyes have introduced imposed to force a pattern on enormity which one does not encounter often made particular — we are in it where we cautiously avoid the undertow time made us time will make us till we tire of it absolutely what we are still so thin the slightest puncture tears this curtain of a body off me then i am as one who secretly a part participant of it pretends to volunteer to vanish at a state-fair magic show that claims a charm in its predictability “ my love consoles me greatly but is love no less for that because it is an undertaking not myself but with a bit of me in it. ” what i can see beyond my eyes is my invention half as much as it is real if real means anything apart from subject to invention though as makers we might deign to praise this still one must admit it grows at times exhausting to remake the world in every sighting of it i suspect you know as well as i do that desire we might feel sometime subjected to another ’ s presence is a sort of longing to experience the object— and sometimes we experience it sometimes that experience is burdensome then we hash the matter over celebrate the isolation one can not alleviate through laughter set the problem to the side friendship unlike love will not destroy us therefore is not penance but what eases hurting also serves can we rightly blame the sun for what evaporates between the intervals of rain “ and if my love is only my invention that is unimportant since to say i love him therefore makes it so to be content is to be so by choice—my friend when she had told me that he came inside her crying choked with guilt pleasure which we all know will intoxicate when mixed was simply unaware that happiness is mine by right if i declare it like the moon with our absurd flag. ” in okinawa also —i can not remember where this lies in time before the black-sand beach or after—i awoke at two o ’ clock one morning sick unable to return to sleep never having woken up so early having never understood that two o ’ clock is full dark stretched like gauze across one corner of the earth my father took me somewhere with him maybe there was someone he had told he ’ d meet likely told me but my memory has found no use for it—we stood outside the car under streetlights in a parking lot near home while he spoke with some man wholly wiped from time i ’ ve known i watched a dozen dragonflies fly circles underneath the streetlight i knew the time of day in which i stood was new tried to watch the dragonflies with desperate attention knowing two o ’ clock was something that existed now with being ’ s stony smirk one doesn ’ t see these things again

my love who shelters in his words sometimes falls silent for a sudden eternity breathes that silence into a bell of glass in which he calms storms he draws lee lines in what was it ’ s more like a firefirm crackling when he takes up words with ease in a single glance caressing my body i read him day and night what will it be like when he withdraws into the word old arranges a last room silver-white pushes the furniture a bit closer together and crams still more fragile glass inside— what will it be like when he grows transparent and breaks
if no one ever marries me — and i do n't see why they should for nurse says i 'm not pretty and i 'm seldom very good— if no one ever marries me i sha n't mind very much i shall buy a squirrel in a cage and a little rabbit-hutch i shall have a cottage near a wood and a pony all my own and a little lamb quite clean and tame that i can take to town and when i 'm getting really old — at twenty-eight or nine— i shall buy a little orphan-girl and bring her up as mine
lady lovely lady careless and gay once when a beggar called she gave her child away the beggar took the baby wrapped it in a shawl “ bring her back ” the lady said “ next time you call. ” hard by lived a vain man so vain and so proud he walked on stilts to be seen by the crowd up above the chimney pots tall as a mast and all the people ran about shouting till he passed “ a splendid match surely ” neighbours saw it plain “ although she is so careless although he is so vain. ” but the lady played bobcherry did not see or care as the vain man went by her aloft in the air this gentle-born couple lived and died apart water will not mix with oil nor vain with careless heart

in the back of the junkhouse stacked on a cardtable covered by a ragged bedspread they rest black platters whose music once crackled hissed with a static like shuffling feet fox trot or two-step the slow dance of the needle riding its merry-go-round my mother ’ s head nestled on my father ’ s shoulder as they turned lost in the sway of sounds summer nights and faraway places the syncopation of time waltzing them to a world they never dreamed dance of then to the dust of now
i we lived on a lake with muscovy ducks interior decorators flush with furniture plans the ducks thrust with the thrust of youth ii we met at the gay community center called compass in lake worth where they sponsored “ the coming out group ” with forest our skilled leader transsexuals met before you were fifty i thirty-nine— somewhat late to begin a life together for the first time we had begun to see announcements in the new york times so we knew it was possible to print “ paul o ’ shaughnessy and spencer reece were joined on a celery green love-seat ” five years we had not forever but something still iii our consent took a long time there were lulls we played scrabble i arranged the tiles and you kept score sometimes we rolled the dice and read the i ching we went about our days unseen and we loved that i placed too many books against the walls— capote madame bovary a biography of anne boleyn you complained about the clutter “ where will guests put their suitcases ” you asked sometimes we squabbled about money often you stretched out upon the double bed your skin no longer young pebbled freckled known by me iv the city was jammed under your nails from construction work callused hands that knew bar-joists yours was an irish body formed and punished by the tin-colored rains around croagh patrick beyond you manatees scarred by propellers huddled in the power plant ’ s warm waters palm fronds and their shadows shook wildly as pornography v on the edges of our dreams was the sea which the moon walked across with soft footsteps vi our dog a lab-mix named butch chewed a bone at your bare feet butch moved like a shadow on the sea ’ s floor big and black he came to us abused— who does such a thing and why is it permanent we fed him a daily xanax tablet before he pulled us on his manic journeys that had no arrivals vii when we visited your aunt annie in the nursing home her walker dominated the room like an empty kennel she did not know who i was her senility rendering me oblique long ago when your mother died your father sent a letter and a photograph of the four children to killeen asking aunt annie to come as she strove across the sea she watched the connemara ponies disappear then knock letterfrack roundstone and cashel bay blurred blurred and blurred until they were nothing but green she left ireland for good and raised you and your three sisters—joan ann and maureen in america she went about her days unseen on her day off she lit four candles for each one of you at the shrine of st. anthony on arch street in boston she never married she adored you when we visited she kept saying “ paul paul i have to get the cows across the stream. ” viii we overlooked pelican lake in juno beach where caregivers and patients from the alzheimer ’ s support group awkwardly commenced their semi-detached dates eating potato chips off paper plates and feeding their broken bits to the ducks eyes vacantly connected in florida where born-agains with failed marriages sent pamphlets to jews so they could be saved by christ to conquer and subdue was what florida was for there we napped while the ducks strutted and preened with greasy black-green plumes and speckled red pates it looked like they had mashed crayons on their heads— a sort of evolutionary mishap developers demanding more room the ducks were sated companioned unbundling with poop ix a retired couple volunteered instructing residents in the tango— the lady had white stained tights the man a tambourine the tango emoted from a boom box as the residents gathered in a crescent moon of wheelchairs aunt annie watched and talked about her cows the stream we stood behind her like groomsmen out the windows boston pontificated x you were distracted distracted until one day you said “ i do not desire you. ” you had always been honest you wanted a younger man between twenty and twenty-five the day blued around us— our book of changes came to a close your christ-kiss issued no more you were what you had always been only more so— irish and unavailable darling xi the horizon became a handsaw when i could not reach what i loved the world was rent xii a friend had a stillborn and her marriage ended she did not name the infant i had coffee with her at the greek restaurant we liked she talked about going back to teach at dreyfoos the arts high school and one student in particular an effeminate male with acne who dreamt of juilliard a way out florida luxuriated out the window— the fire bush the cornflower blue plumbago the mexican petunia i sold my library my piano i boarded a train seagulls diminished gray specks gray motes the therapist in fort lauderdale made no more appointments for us the migrant day laborers out in pahokee and canal point on lake okeechobee gleaned and went about their days unseen the orange groves ’ fragile hemispheres wobbled on their stems sugar cane fields burned electrical poles gleamed buck hoists and bucket trucks broke through the possum ’ s sedge the everglades sighed its nervous extinction xiii aunt annie had lost her index finger in coventry during the blitz repeatedly she rubbed the stump xiv perhaps you walk now there with your young men meaty st. augustine grass under your feet moving discreetly undetected perhaps you speak of dissatisfactions of politics the atlantic narrowing to a flushed sanguine strip the fishing boats alone in the dark murmuring hooking perhaps the young men love you at first sight and plead with you to stay i95 and a1a pulsing down palm beach county ’ s spits like blood perhaps your face tightens tenderly in response to what you see
zipping your skirt you rustle past sand hissing through a glass with the bedouin snap and flash of static-electric sparks disturbing fabric this morning ’ s charge could rouse the desert fathers of sinai over which i drowse
he slid the stiff blade up to my ear oh fear this should have been thirst a cheapening act but i lacked as usual the crucial disbelief sticky cold a billfold wet in my mouth wrists bound by his belt i felt like the boy in a briny night pool he who found the drowned body yet still somehow swam with an unknown joy that boy
sex is always monstrous blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body “ please touch me there more oh god. ” for a hitchhiker the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift itchy unsafe space on the verge of a new mexico highway it is often the sex of another era in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed i hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me ultra-american like a christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick at first my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian after all it is not really hitchhiking to buy a greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons again this is an example of departure in another time as a foreign student on scholarship it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on salman rushdie ’ s early works nevertheless “ how can we keep tabs on these ji visa holders who come over here and the university as an institution really needs to be more accountable we need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information they need to do their course work and then they need to go home. ” i didn ’ t want to go home this is a boring sentence perhaps for you oregon is a calming word evoking images of blackberry pie ocean vistas and the capture of suspected felons i had never heard the word oregon before like the distance of scotland from london it seemed impossibly far a beautiful hazard to go and keep going how can i put this in england nobody ever ever ever did this i who once drove straight to glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar in a dinged-up datsun cherry was considered an anomaly “ are you demented why do you want to drive in a car to bloody scotland it ’ s seven hours on the m1 man ” though outwardly i was wan and somewhat reticent i no i was my sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in hyde park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the london school of economics that my breasts in that position from that angle resembled two fried eggs we were meeting in a park as per the era i am sure contemporary punjabi-british teenagers are fearless individuals undaunted by the prospect of community censure back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades it is always a century in my century sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like scotland or wales and borrowing my father ’ s car forever “ are you out of your bleeding head your dad ’ s going to skin you alive ” in some sense this driving is the opposite of hitchhiking in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar the day was real in a different way back then in the way that it sensitized me to risk a kind of twin to permisson two black swans that day and this one history and fiction what i went for and what i really wanted which i didn ’ t know until i got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible considering the trouble i was already in and the rain which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets the streetlamps were pink on prince street in glasgow i saw the sign for american style pizza and went down the steps to the basement café the tables were coated with green plastic there was hot tea which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as i focused my eye on a laminated print of a white blocky rose with a pink dot at its center “ charles rennie mackintosh ” the waitress pronouncing “ osh ” so that it rhymed with horse “ are you from india ” “ would you like some jam with that scone i bet they don ’ t have scones in india do they ” “ more tea i heard you have a lot of tea over there isn ’ t that right ” plan b the extension of my throat the euphoria of theft other countries with their sayings and beliefs the original plan formulated by my father during his morning communte across london marrying a british-born hindu brahmin dentist with brown skin but not too brown and rosy cheeks note on the mantelpiece tucked behind the marble figurine of shiva what is forthcoming under the original plan extraction what kind of sex is possible on the dentist ’ s chair late at night for that girl your girl who nervously asks for a blanket she has her socks on she ’ s shivering it is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients but in this scene the limbs of the dentist ’ s young asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen-scented nail polish or mouthwash dad “ please don ’ t swallow. ” rinse then spit spit then swallow i could not go home and so after a brief visit to the hill house—charles rennie mackintosh ’ s art deco home on the firth of clyde where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy as it seemed from the décor—i turned left and kept driving i drove my car into the atlantic and kept driving my chest very tight beneath the surface it was difficult to feel anything or really to see and so i can only say that i went into a damaging ocean this is going damaged washed up on the mythical shores of new jersey a few days later my car failed to start this is later when the car stopped and looking up from my hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel i realized that i was okay now i am here in the future of color i ’ m sorry i do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival i am not interested in it i do not recall it i it was only when my car stopped that i realized what i had to do on my own terms with my own two legs get going is that how you say it get up and go the destiny of my body as separate from my childhood i came here to hitchhike i came here to complete a thing i began in another place removing wet pages from my rucksack i lay them on the shore securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles when they dried i folded them into squares and put them in my pocket next to my body misshapen exhilarated i said get i said go get up now and go “ are you okay ” “ do you need a ride somewhere ” “ let me look in the trunk i might have something in there here you go you ’ re shivering do you need to go to the hospital at least let me buy you a cup of coffee ”
beloved i have to adore the earth the wind must have heard your voice once it echoes and sings like you the soil must have tasted you once it is laden with your scent the trees honor you in gold and blush when you pass i know why the north country is frozen it has been trying to preserve your memory i know why the desert burns with fever it was wept too long without you on hands and knees the ocean begs up the beach and falls at your feet i have to adore the mirror of the earth you have taught her well how to be beautiful
filled with old lovers in the clutch of the chair you are a bloom of uncombed hair with a collection of roses bowls of mashed petals i make a clear cup of sky fold away clouds roll up blankets of blue i am a body of empty husks indian corn is in your hair the tassels the pollen fertility indelible ink is tattooing our lungs we speak smoke we exchange our lunacy for reverence respect tornados windy woman four winds we have extended the edge of expectation by merely living you have tallied compulsion into currency i am measured by the excitement my lips stir i am the bin for castoffs and the weary i wear my veil i have no children but you have many you dream of heaven and they all run up to meet you
i every day it is the same he comes home he tells her about it as he speaks his breath condenses in front of his face she goes about her business every now and then she looks over she doesn ’ t hear his voice she sees the soft fog that continues to form a halo she knows he is still talking about that place he never tires of it like she does only on summer days when the air is hot and moisture is still a long time in coming she asks him to tell her about that place she sits facing him waiting for the first vocalic non-stops the push of air from his lips he tells her of the place where clouds are formed the cool dampness of his voice is rich even on a dry june day her face beads with wetness as he talks directly to her each aspirated sound a gentle burst of coolness “ tell me again tell me again ” she teases if he knew she only wanted relief from the heat and not the story he would stop talking he begins “ the first time i saw the place where clouds are formed was from the window of a train ” another time was in a mirage in the heat outside tucson once he thought he saw it in the dry light of stars the place he remembers best was when he saw it in the eyes of a woman he spoke to when he first noticed it she hid it by lowering her gaze soon she let him look freely there were times when she opened her eyes wide allowing an unobscured view sometimes he saw her eyes smolder with dryness on a summer day other times she was rich with moisture clouds came in succession the earth ’ s shadows muted “ you know the forty days and forty nights i was there i ’ ll be there when it happens again ” she said with a slight smile like a child he rushed to look into her eyes at every opportunity if he could he would hang on her eye socket peering inside marveling at her displays ii an unusually cold december day right around christmas clouds mist find solace in the canyons of the santa catalina mountains white moisture quietly moving amid the cactus truly clouds wind and rain are the few elements that can touch the saguaro from head to foot oblivious of spines needles rubbery hide surrounded soothed by elements contact triggers stored heat of remembered summers moisture beads roll forward unstoppable from the city below we see mist rising mist rising iii we sit close in the cab of the truck the weather is cold wet outside too messy to stand in waiting for a school bus my father ’ s truck is warm inside having been at work since four a.m. the sound of the engine is soothing heater working to capacity inside the cab we are silent we don ’ t need language we listen to the regular hum of the engine rhythm of the windshield wipers soft rain on the hood aware of the cold air surrounding our temporary shelter we look out over the fields where fog clings to the soil every now and then with the back of his gloved hand he wipes the windshield “ is it coming yet ” the three of us sit quietly breathing clouds clouds condense as they contact the coolness of the windows my father appears to breathe air with temperature in balance he forms no clouds he watches us we continue to breathe gray soft mist waiting for the school bus
somewhere zeno was smiling the foul goblins of paradox were wearing their fairest clothes that night my dinner with a chainsaw the evening could have been called and when one too many led to wise judgements too few “ i ’ m trying to break up with you ” he shouted as stockings and scruples flew and what was over wasn ’ t the brutal doings were sweeter than a caress the thrill of it happening and the horror of it being an awful mistake collided like sweaty bodies in the dark disheveled room so this is moving on she reflected after he left but what was motion no straight bright line but a wind every bit as stormy as the people it carried away from safety through towns that froze and burned helping them forward but not letting them forget for a second their ceaseless looking for what is lost their sad resemblance to the quick and stubborn arrows that never arrive
in an uncurtained room across the way a woman in a tight dress paints her lips a deeper red and sizes up her hips for signs of ounces gained since yesterday she has a thoughtful and a clever face but she is also smart enough to know the truth however large the brain may grow the lashes and the earrings must keep pace although i ’ ve spread my books in front of me with a majestic air of i ’ ll show her i ’ m much less confident than i ’ d prefer and now i ’ ve started pacing nervously i ’ m poring over theorems tomes and tracts i ’ m getting ready for a heavy date by staying up ridiculously late but a small voice advises face the facts go on this way and you ’ ll soon come to harm the world ’ s most famous scholars wander down the most appalling alleyways in town a blond and busty airhead on each arm there is an inner motor known as lust that makes a man of learning walk a mile to gratify his raging senses while the woman he can talk to gathers dust a chilling vision of the years ahead invades my thoughts and widens like a stain a barren dance card and a teeming brain a crowded bookcase and an empty bed ... what if i compromised i ’ d stay up late to hone my elocutionary skills and at the crack of dawn i ’ d swallow pills to calm my temper and control my weight but i just can ’ t romantics so far gone they think their lovers live for wisdom woo by growing wiser when i think of you i find the nearest lamp and turn it on great gods of longing watch me as i work and if i sprout a martyr ’ s smarmy grin please find some violent way to do me in i ’ m burning all these candles not to shirk a night of passion but to give that night a richly textured backdrop when it comes the girl who gets up from her desk and dumbs her discourse down has never seen the flight of wide-eyed starlings from their shabby cage the fool whose love is truest is the one who knows a lover ’ s work is never done i ’ ll call you when i ’ ve finished one more page
knoxville december 27 2016 for marilyn kallet ’ s 70th birthday this poem was constructed to carry any memory you want to hold close we arrived when the days grew legs of night chocolates were offered we ate latkes for hours to celebrate light and friends we will keep going despite dark or a madman in a white house dream let ’ s talk about something else said the dog who begs faithfully at the door of goodwill a biscuit will do a voice of reason meat sticks — i dreamed all of this i told her you me and paris — it was impossible to make it through the tragedy without poetry what are we without winds becoming words becoming old children born to children born to sing us into love another level of love beyond the neighbor ’ s holiday light display proclaiming goodwill to all men who have lost their way in the dark as they tried to find the car door the bottle hidden behind the seat reason to keep on going past all the times they failed at sharing love love it ’ s weak they think — or some romantic bullshit a movie set propped up behind on slats said the wizard of junk understanding who pretends to be the wise all-knowing dog behind a cheap fan it ’ s in the plan for the new world straining to break through the floor of this one said the angel of all-that-you-know-and-forgot-and-will-find as she flutters the edge of your mind when you try to sing the blues to the future of everything that might happen and will all the losses come tumbling down down down at three in the morning as do all the shouldn ’ t-haves or should-haves it doesn ’ t matter girl — i ’ ll be here to pick you up said memory in her red shoes and the dress that showed off brown legs when you met him at the age you have always loved hair perfect with a little wave and that shine in your skin from believing what was impossible was possible you were not afraid you stood up in love in a french story and there fell ever a light rain as you crossed the seine to meet him for café in saint-germain-des-prés you wrote a poem beneath the tender skin from your ribs to your hip bone in the slender then and you are still writing that song to convince the sweetness of every bit of straggling moonlight star and sunlight to become words in your mouth in your kiss — that kiss that will never die you will all ways fall in love it doesn ’ t matter how old how many days hours or memories we can fall in love over and over again the seine or tennessee or any river with a soul knows the depths descending when it comes to seeing the sun or moon stare back without shame remorse or guilt this is what i remember she told her husband when they bedded down that night in the house that would begin marriage that house was built of twenty-four doves rugs from india cooking recipes from seven generations of mothers and their sisters and wave upon wave of tears and the concrete of resolution for the steps that continue all the way to the heavens past guardian dogs dog after dog to protect they are humble earth angels and the rowdiest even nasty you try and lick yourself like that imagine and the old woman laughed as she slipped off her cheap shoes and parked them under the bed that lies at the center of the garden of good and evil she ’ d seen it all done it more than once tonight she just wanted a good sleep and picked up the book of poetry by her bed which was over a journal she kept when her mother was dying these words from may sarton she kept in the fourth room of her heart “ love come upon him warily and deep for if he startle first it were as well to bind a fox ’ s throat with a gold bell /as hold him when it is his will to leap. ” and she considered that every line of a poem was a lead line into the spirit world to capture a bit of memory pieces of gold confetti a kind of celebration we all want to be remembered even memory even the way the light came in the kitchen window when her mother turned up the dial on that cool mist color of a radio when memory crossed the path of longing and took mother ’ s arm and she put down her apron said “ i don ’ t mind if i do ” and they danced you watching as you began your own cache of remembering already you had stored the taste of mother as milk father as a labor of sweat and love and night as a lonely boat of stars that took you into who you were before you slid through the hips of the story there are no words when you cross the gate of forbidden waters or is it a sheer scarf of the finest silk or is it something else that causes you to forget nothing is ever forgotten says the god of remembering who protects the heartbeat of every little cell of knowing from the antarctic to the soft spot at the top of this planetary baby oh baby come here let me tell you the story of the party you will never forget no matter where you go where you are or where you will be when you cross the line and say no more no more greedy kings no more disappointments no more orphans or thefts of souls or lands no more killing for the sport of killing no more no more except more of the story so i will understand exactly what i am doing here and why she said to the fox guardian who took her arm to help her cross the road that was given to the care of natives who made sure the earth spirits were fed with songs and the other things they loved to eat they like sweets cookies and flowers it was getting late and the fox guardian picked up her books as she hurried through the streets of strife but it wasn ’ t getting late there was no late only a plate of tamales on the counter waiting to be or not to be at this age said the fox we are closer to the not to be which is the to be in the fields of sweet grasses wherever you are enjoy the evening how the sun walks the horizon before cross sing over to be and we then exist under the realm of the moon there ’ s where fears slay us in the dark of the howling mind we all battle befriend them the moon said as a crab skittered under her skirt her daughter in the high chair waiting for cereal and toast what a girl she turned out to be a willow tree a blessing to the winds to her family there she is married and we start the story all over again said her father in a toast to the happiness of who we are and who we are becoming as change in a new model sedan whips it down the freeway toward the generations that follow one after another in the original lands of the mvskoke who are still here nobody goes anywhere though we are always leaving and returning it ’ s a ceremony sunrise occurs everywhere in lizard time human time or a fern uncurling time we instinctually reach for light food we digest it make love art or trouble of it the sun crowns us at noon the whole earth is a queen then there are always goodbyes at sunset say goodbye to hurt to suffering to the pain you caused others or yourself goodbye goodbye to carrie fisher the star wars phenomenon and george michael the singer they were planets in our emotional universe some of my memories are opened by the image of love on screen in an imagined future or broken open when the sax solo of “ careless whisper ” blows through the communal heart yes there ’ s a cosmic consciousness jung named it but it was there long before named by vedic and mvskoke scientists and there is a cosmic hearteousness — for the heart is the higher mind and nothing can be forgotten there no ever or ever how do i sing this so i don ’ t forget ask the poets each word is a box that can be opened or closed then a train of words phrases garnered by music and the need for rhythm to organize chaos like right here now in this poem is the transition phase i remembered it while giving birth summer sun bearing down on the city melting asphalt but there we were my daughter and i at the door between worlds i was happier than ever before to welcome her happiness was the path she chose to enter and i couldn ’ t push yet not yet and then there appeared a pool of the bluest water we waited there for a breath to catch up and then it did and she took it that girl who was beautiful beyond dolphin dreaming and we made it we did to the other side of suffering this is the story our mothers tell but we couldn ’ t hear it in our ears stuffed with barbie advertising with our mothers ’ own loathing set in place by patriarchal scripture the smothering rules to stop insurrection by domesticated slaves or wives it hurt everybody the fathers can not know what they are feeling in such a spiritual backwash worship boxes set into place by the need for money and power will not beget freedom only warships for freedom freedom oh freedom sang the slaves the oar rhythm of the blues lifting up the spirits of peoples whose bodies were worn out or destroyed by a man ’ s slash hit of greed this is our memory too said america heredity is a field of blood celebration and forgetfulness don ’ t take on more than you can carry said the eagle to his twin sons fighting each other in the sky over a fox dangling between them it ’ s that time of the year when we eat tamales and latkes we light candles fires to make the way for a newborn child for fresh understanding demons will try to make houses out of jealousy anger pride greed or more destructive material they place them in a part of the body that will hold them liver heart knee or brain so my friend let ’ s let that go for joy for chocolates made of ashes mangos grapefruit or chili from oaxaca for sparkling wine from spain for these children who show up in our dreams and want to live at any cost because we are here to feed them joy your soul is so finely woven the silkworms went on strike said the mulberry tree we all have mulberry trees in the memory yard they hold the place for skinned knees earned by small braveries cousins you love who are gone a father cutting a watermelon in the summer on the porch and a mother so in love that her heart breaks — it will never be the same yet all memory bends to

what stays in doesn ’ t come out nipples hard with milk when things are of another time they are of that time not timeless they are no longer here nipples hard with liquid or falsities white and soft i can ’ t get it out no matter how hard i yank or pull and suck face watching with my own nipple in my mouth like the room she ’ s in i went and i seduced but no matter what i couldn ’ t get her to leave aqua and in the morning coffee the bathroom gold and green no matter what i said she stayed there she had her own fantasies to wait for milk that never comes out it grows inside does it fold back in time i want to say it becomes different the man who grafted another face what poems i wrote for him no i want to say that when you came at me with the syringe that i loved you in gold and green you came at me revision upon revision of your love it wasn ’ t like you to give up i knocked and knocked and you went back into your doorway what days the nipples rising with future things to come what happened to those thoughts to those people i loved that woman in the building sunset road the place with the dead babies but no matter what i did how hard i yanked she would never leave i knocked and knocked no matter what i did or said i just couldn ’ t get her out of there
i wonder if i know enough to know what it ’ s really like to have been here have i seen sights enough to give seeing over the clouds i ’ ve waited with white october clouds like these this afternoon often before and taken them in but white clouds shade other white ones gray had i noticed that and though i ’ ve followed the leaves of many falls have i spent time with the wire vines left when frost ’ s red dyes strip the leaves away is more missing than was never enough i ’ m sure many of love ’ s kinds absolve and heal but were they passing rapids or welling stirs i suppose i haven ’ t done and seen enough yet to go and anyway it may be way on on the way before one picks up the track of the sufficient the world-round reach spirit deep easing and all not just mind answering itself but mind and things apprehended at once as one all giving all way not a scrap of question holding back
the first line is a row of girls twenty-five of them almost a painting shoulders overlapping angled slightly toward you one says i ’ m myself here the others shudder and laugh through the ribbon core that strings them they make a tone tighter by drumming on their thighs and opening their mouths the girls are cells the girls are a fence a fibrous network one by one they describe their grievances large hot malfunctioning machines lie obediently at their sides their shirts are various shades of ease in the surrounding air which is littered with small cuts one will choose you press you into the ground you may never recover the second-to-last line has a fold in it the last line is the steady pour of their names
on the first day you were beautiful and good on the second you grew a horn on the third a lead-gray wing budded from your shoulder on the fourth a claw sprouted from your shoe on the fifth you flew right into my armpit built a nest and then lost interest on the sixth you were a host of leeches having their way with my veins on the seventh i heard you trotting above me with hollow hoof beats on the eighth you went to moses to ask for advice winged horned buraq the prophet ’ s steed returned as a lamb on the ninth to graze on my belly fur on the tenth you died for isaac the angel decided in favor of animal testing on the eleventh i had forgotten the color of your eyes on the twelfth day you were poor and naked on the thirteenth you were lying on the bottom of the sea a millions of eons old whispering mussel on the fourteenth they called you into the field duldul ali ’ s tireless gray mule on the fifteenth you stood still welded on the lip of a kettle the sweat of the holy brew had oxidized your copper neck on the sixteenth you were the primordial ox zarathustra sang of your suffering on the seventeenth day when i came home you were once again the one human being
today when persimmons ripen today when fox-kits come out of their den into snow today when the spotted egg releases its wren song today when the maple sets down its red leaves today when windows keep their promise to open today when fire keeps its promise to warm today when someone you love has died or someone you never met has died today when someone you love has been born or someone you will not meet has been born today when rain leaps to the waiting of roots in their dryness today when starlight bends to the roofs of the hungry and tired today when someone sits long inside his last sorrow today when someone steps into the heat of her first embrace today let this light bless you with these friends let it bless you with snow-scent and lavender bless you let the vow of this day keep itself wildly and wholly spoken and silent surprise you inside your ears sleeping and waking unfold itself inside your eyes let its fierceness and tenderness hold you let its vastness be undisguised in all your days
i have to tell you there are times when the sun strikes me like a gong and i remember everything even your ears
it was your idea to park and watch the elephants swaying among the trees like royalty at that make-believe safari near laguna i didn ’ t know anything that big could be so quiet and once you stopped on a dark desert road to show me the stars climbing over each other riotously like insects like an orchestra thrashing its way through time itself i never saw light that way again
the pleasure of contrast not chained up in an oilcoth sack underwater holding his breath but composing himself for the camera in his only suit you have to understand photography— unforgiving mirror unlike oils that soften the hard edges of a man ’ s face if you want them to or velvet curtain shielding the pine box during an escape the audience imagines his bones contracting to a splinter that ’ s not at all how it ’ s done— the camera ’ s lens blanketed by cloth to keep it in the dark any halo of light ruptures the film with shadow his eyes already turn inward to that place we ’ re going she thinks about escape too at the horse butcher in line like the others or arguing over the price of bread at the market of innocents adam ’ s rib is forever hidden inside her chest as the force of blows hibernates in a boxer ’ s fist but she at least is smiling when he says we have such a small family meaning your body won ’ t open to me—it ’ s shackled inside its cage love and rage whose bars are meant to be broken
remembering you and reviewing our structural love the past re-arises alive from its smothering dust for memory which is only decadent in hands like a miser ’ s loving the thing for its thingness or in the eyes of collectors who assess the size the incredible size of their collection can in the living head create and make new the sometimes appallingly ancient present and sting the sleeping thing to a sudden seeing and as a tree with all its leaves relaxed can shiver at the memory of wind or the still waters of a pool recall their springing origin and rise and fall suddenly over the encircling basin ’ s lip— so i remembering from now to then can know and see and feel again as jewels must when held in a brilliant branch of sun
i washed a load of clothes and hung them out to dry then i went up to town and busied myself all day the sleeve of your best shirt rose ceremonious when i drove in our night- clothes twined and untwined in a little gust of wind for me it was getting late for you where you were not the harvest moon was full but sparse clouds made its light not quite reliable the bed on your side seemed as wide and flat as kansas your pillow plump cool and allegorical
the first hot april day the granite step was warm flies droned in the grass when a car went past they rose in unison then dropped back down i saw that a yellow crocus bud had pierced a dead oak leaf then opened wide how strong its appetite for the luxury of the sun everyone longs for love ’ s tense joy and red delights and then i spied an ant dragging a ragged disembodied wing up the warm brick walk it must have been the methodist in me that leaned forward preceded by my shadow to put a twig just where the ant was struggling with its own desire

how were we to know leaving your two kids behind in new hampshire for our honeymoon at twenty-one that it was a trick of cheap hotels in new york city to draw customers like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby arriving in our fourth-floor room we found a bed a scarred bureau and a bathroom door with a cut on one side the exact shape of the toilet bowl that was in its way when i closed it i opened and shut the door admiring the fit and despairing of it you discovered the initials of lovers carved on the bureau ’ s top in a zigzag breaking heart how wrong the place was to us then unable to see the portents of our future that seem so clear now in the naiveté of the arrangements we made the hotel ’ s disdain for those with little money the carving of pain and love yet in that room we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay our love down and in this way began our unwise and persistent and lucky life together
every morning i look for you on the menu where are your eyes and lips my side order of thighs i ’ m so hungry for the sauce of you and the way your blouse opens like a flame
i 'm preparing myself for an extended period of loneliness that will begin very soon i think i 've illegally downloaded two new depressing songs i 've placed a copy of good morning midnight under my pillow for easy reference i 've printed out the tablature for every morrissey song i know so i can sing them to myself alone in my room just a few things are needed really to make me calm while i figure out a simple clean and effective way to kill myself with minimal stress for the person who has to find and dispose of my body but i 'll probably never think of a way because i 'll probably never kill myself i 'll just lie in my bed suffocating myself with my pillows while listening to the four songs you said were your favorite and maybe burn myself a little with the iron on special occasions and the next time i 'm in a subway station i 'll stand a little further on the yellow line or maybe the next i 'm at your apartment i 'll try a little harder
he glanced around to check if the treacherous gods had really given him the reward promised for his accomplished song and there she was eurydice restored perfectly naked and fleshed in her rhyming body again the upper and lower smiles and eyes the line of mouth-sternum-navel-cleft the chime of breasts and hips and of the two knees the feet the toes and that expression of an unimaginable intelligence that yoked all these with a skill she herself had forgotten the learning of there she was with him once more just for an instant as she vanished and then he heard her from behind the invisible veil absence a shrill and batlike but lexical indictment why had he violated the divine command why when he had seized all song to himself and robbed her of power to open her own oblivion it grew in volume and now seemed to spew from an insane old mother with one breast hanging like a huge withered testicle from a rent in her weathered gown who was being watched by a tall woman copper-helmet-coiffed richly suited in salmon colour a mythical allusion since salmon were long extinct in the bays and rivers here songs never brought them anymore the young restrained breasts and the old free one oppressed him equally and he went to live among men waiting for the crazy and the competent to join forces and come for him with their scissors orpheus listened patiently to my poem and when it quieted he said to me that was n't it at all i sang outward from my face to blue spaces between clouds to fern fronds and men and women sipped my song as you drink from a stream going by what i sang is lost in time you do n't kmow what it was all you have is your own old stories about me and if women tore me into pieces maybe that only signifies each one keeps part of my body which is melody among visible things
when i think of that room i see the de kooning at the end of the hall sometimes rain on the long windows or the tinkering of drops on the skylight but not yvon splashing scotch into a cocktail glass otherwise fastidious— in retrospect i should have asked her more about the famous jazz guitarist she had been engaged to but that much was true— even after she bought me a pocket knife sheathed in velvet every young man needs a knife she informed her group but in the restaurant her friends eyed me like a turnip one that talked— while she was away at her office i tried to read her unfinished essay on the vagaries of diplomacy reclining on a rug of embroidered storks the two small rodins seemed misplaced a grand piano she didn ’ t play though i did affecting a controlled passion while gazing over rooftops at carefully maintained gardens — i don ’ t remember her smell i don ’ t recall her fingers the last i heard she was living in barcelona she never did learn to cook now her letters are worth money
first there was jim clamping to my long black hair that nine-pound cleopatra wig with nylon bands and bobbie pins meanwhile i was on fire for chad who coached me a bit impatiently tuesday nights on my joan-of-arc inflection then terence said i ’ d be perfect for the lounge-singer- turned-whore and as it turned out that was a fairly easy gig max signed me on soon after claiming i was a natural for eternally aggrieved girl which in hindsight hurts me deeply so by the time you followed me back to the green room to wait in the hallway—whistling — for my scrubbed face to emerge naturally i was wary waiting for the script you never bothered to come up with it was damned awkward sitting there nothing but milkshakes between us maybe i thought you ’ d assumed i was the one with a script finally i decided to give terence a call i didn ’ t like the way you looked at me so steadily with your chin resting on one fist as if the table were a table the boards a floor listening there as if you meant it as if something i could say were true and every moment from now on would be my cue
everyone comes here from a long way off is a line from a poem i read last night driving up 80 in the haze they talked and talked smoke in the air shimmering from wildfires his story was sad and hers was roiled troubled alternatively a man and a woman old friends are in a theater watching a movie in which a man and a woman old friends are driving through summer on a mountain road the woman is describing the end of her marriage and sobbing shaking her head and laughing and sobbing the man is watching the road listening his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance and because in the restaurant before the film the woman had been describing the end of her marriage and cried they are not sure whether they are in the theater or on the mountain road and when the timber truck comes suddenly around the bend they both flinch he found that it was no good trying to tell what happened that day everything he said seemed fictional the moment that he said it the rain the scent of her hair what she said as she was leaving and why it was important for him to explain that the car had been parked under eucalyptus on a hillside and how velvety and blurred the trees looked through the windshield not he said that making fictions might not be the best way of getting at it but that nothing he said had the brute abject unassimilated quality of a wounding experience the ego in any telling was already seeing itself as a character and a character he said was exactly what he was not at that moment even as he kept wanting to explain to someone to whomever would listen that she had closed the door so quietly and so firmly that the beads of rain on the side window didn ’ t even quiver names for involuntary movements of the body— squirm wince flinch and shudder— sound like a law firm in dickens “ mr flinch took off his black gloves as if he were skinning his hands. ” “ quiver dipped the nib of his pen into the throat of the inkwell. ” the receptionist at the hospital morgue

very very poor how eldie got her name the neighborhood had been so dangerous she said there was one summer when the mailmen refused to deliver the mail her mother never appeared and her grandmother who had bought a handgun for protection and had also taught her how to use it would walk her to the post office for the sweet singsong half-rhymed letters that smelled or that she imagined smelled of

riddle ’ s a needle a refrain might go and plainly said is thread she looked beautiful and looked her age too she ’ d had a go at putting herself together she had always had the confidence that with a face like hers a few touches to represent the idea of a put-together look would do like some set designer ’ s genius minimalism it had a slightly harridan effect and he remembered that it wasn ’ t what was headlong or slapdash about her but the way they gestured like a quotation at an understanding of elegance it would have been boring to spell out that had at first dazzled him about her he felt himself stirring at this recognition and at a certain memory that attended it and then laughed at the thought that he had actually stimulated himself with an analysis of her style and she said as if she were remembering the way he could make her insecure “ what what are you smiling about ” and he said “ nothing. ” and she said “ oh yes right i remember nothing. ” two jokes walk into a bar a

they could not sleep for the heat and the stillness and they went outside beyond the wall of their parents ’ garden and into a meadow it was a dark night moonless and the stars were so thick they seemed to shudder and the sisters stood a long time in the sweet smell of the cooling grasses looking at the sky and listening in the silence after a while they heard a stirring and saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching them from the woods ’ edge “ maybe it ’ s their friend the bear ” one of the children said “ i don ’ t like this story ” said the other

from a story of how the tobacco plant came to our people told to me by my cousin george coser jr. it was way back before there was a way back when time threaded earth and sky children were conceived were born grew and walked tall in what we now call a day there must have been two suns a bright moon somehow we had more light than now sheen of falling in love playing about earth ’ s body in a wild flicker which lit us up we who were this planet and yearned for touch every planted thought grew plant ladders to the stars way back before there was no way back miss mary mack we used to sing along the buttons of her dress our babies are always our babies even back then when time waved through the corn we knew our plants like relatives their stories were our stories there were songs for everything — i should say “ are ” songs for every transformation they link between way back and now the forever now a time when a young mvskoke man and woman walked through the shimmer of the early evening they had become as one song they lay down when it was dark i can hear their intimate low-voice talking how they tease one another with such gut love earth makes a bed with pillow mounds and it is there as the night insects sing they conceived their first child they will look back as they walk east toward the sunrise the raw stalks of beginning will drink the light root deeply dark into earth in the tracks of their loving the plant-child emerges first the seed head then leafy long male body and the white female flowers of tobacco or hece as the people called it when it called to them come here we were brought to you from those who love you we will help you and that ’ s how it began way back when we knew how to hear the songs of plants and could sing back like now on paper with marks like bird feet but where are our ears they have grown to fit around earbuds to hear music made for cold cash like our beloved smoke- making threaded with addiction and dead words sing this song back to me girl in the moonlight tobacco plant had silver moon buttons all up her back we ’ re getting dressed to go plant new songs with words our sun is dimming faster mvto hece mvto hvse mvto e — kanvchaga mvto ah

where do you want my heart now placed next to yours on your pale skin so that i will fall in love with your sweaty pain i have heard your bones crack the dry cement that leafed the frenzied spirit within i witnessed its wildness escape into your body screaming kissy words while your fingers plucked at my guitar your eyes were koyoti ’ s ska-la-la ’ s trying to rip a path to my soul i froze there in my manly state knowing there ’ s nothing that i can do

the hotel bar downstairs was dirty and dark and almost empty except for him whom i didn ’ t know i lost my balance because evil is aroused by absence outside on the island a brick city had grown up and old a person could only nibble on its shadows where was my beloved the cornerstone was familiar but unrecognizable and i didn ’ t understand why infinity was seeping into my hair somebody said “ he ’ s out of his bottle ” i guess it meant temporarily out of service and empty but then there was arsene beside the last remaining cabin wandering with his eyes on the camera dynamite in his pocket and a piece of thread to trap a rabbit evil is a growing thing it has its own gravity and never answers to its name it is a hole into chaos it is real arsene held me in his arms he was drunk as usual and his nipple smelled of rum but still i loved him— loved him madly — as if he was the one

dear love where the red lillies blossomed and grew the white snows are falling and all through the wood where i wandered with you the loud winds are calling and the robin that piped to us tune upon tune neath the elm—you remember over tree-top and mountain has followed the june and left us—december has left like a friend that is true in the sun and false in the shadows he has found new delights in the land where he 's gone greener woodlands and meadows what care we let him go let the snow shroud the lea let it drift on the heather we can sing through it all i have you—you have me and we ’ ll laugh at the weather the old year may die and a new one be born that is bleaker and colder but it can not dismay us we dare it—we scorn for love makes us bolder ah robin sing loud on the far-distant lea thou friend in fair weather but here is a song sung that ’ s fuller of glee by two warm hearts together
i throughout the afternoon i watched them there snow-fairies falling falling from the sky whirling fantastic in the misty air contending fierce for space supremacy and they flew down a mightier force at night as though in heaven there was revolt and riot and they frail things had taken panic flight down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet i went to bed and rose at early dawn to see them huddled together in a heap each merged into the other upon the lawn worn out by the sharp struggle fast asleep the sun shone brightly on them half the day by night they stealthily had stol ’ n away ii and suddenly my thoughts then turned to you who came to me upon a winter ’ s night when snow-sprites round my attic window flew your hair disheveled eyes aglow with light my heart was like the weather when you came the wanton winds were blowing loud and long but you with joy and passion all aflame you danced and sang a lilting summer song i made room for you in my little bed took covers from the closet fresh and warm a downful pillow for your scented head and lay down with you resting in my arm you went with dawn you left me ere the day the lonely actor of a dreamy play
i miss the moshpit pushed to the side of the bed the hard and fast rules the business walking across town the baby ’ s hand in mine gave me anxiety rosado barely mellowed who doesn ’ t love to hear about anxiety you wouldn ’ t be too wrong to wake from dreaming into an amusement park sluice of rioja eau de post-auden thanks a lot timex hubbub those feelings are in their way good luck i don ’ t even need a communion wafer to feel the need to broadcast imprecations fade like a docent as the hedge fund falls
it begins with your face of a stone where lips repose like two seals in a coastal mist of cigarette smoke you move through the streets— listing them is as useless as naming waves that city is so handsome for a reason— it was made out of your rib it continues with my skidmarked by a dress body i stand on the border on heels like my sixth toes and show you where to park that very night lying together in the dogs yard —flowers are biting my back — you whisper the longer i look on the coins of your nipples the clearer i see the queen ’ s profile for you body and money are the same as the chicken and the egg the metaphor of “ a woman ’ s purse ” escapes you stealing you like to mumble a purse is a purse is a purse is a purse also a real purse in your hand is worth two metaphorical purses over your mouth they tell me you are a body anchored to the shore by its rusting blood your wound darkens on your chest like a crow i tell them—as agreed—that you are my youth an apple that bit into me to forget its own knowledge death hands you every new day like a golden coin as the bribe grows it gets harder to turn it down your heart of gold gets heavier to carry your hands know that a car has a waist and a gun—a lobe you take me where the river once lifted its skirts and god abashed with that view ordered to cover that shame with a city its dance square shrank by the darkness to the size of a sleeping infant ’ s slightly open mouth i can not tell between beggars ’ stretched hands and dogs ’ dripping tongues you can not tell between legs— mine—tables ’ —chairs ’ —others ’ that dance square is a cage where accordions grin at dismembered violin torsos beggars lick thin air off their lips women whirling in salsa slash you across the chest with the blades of their skirts soiled with peonies
a clementine of inclement climate grows tart a crocus too stoic to open won ’ t like an oyster that cloisters a spoil of pearls untouched— the heart that ’ s had enough stays shut
off rows of windshields in the amtrak lot rain in sudden clumps like jacks parked cars with people in them awaiting people they imagine hurtling through suburbs of silver woods awaiting them true love needs interference a certain blizzard distance for the words to worm through remember iowa august storms that would self-spark as if our fights could trip the finest wire beneath the sidewalk and the sunlight harder after
all night long i hear the sleepers toss between the darkened window and the wall the madman ’ s whimper and the lover ’ s voice the worker ’ s whisper and the sick child ’ s call— knowing them all i ’ d walk a mile maybe hearing some cat crying its guts out to throttle it by hand such simple love i had i wished i might— or god might—answer each call in person and each poor demand well i ’ d have been better off sleeping myself these fancies had some sentimental charm but love without direction is a cheap blanket and even if it did no one any harm no one is warm
i am doing laps at night alone in the indoor pool outside it is snowing but i am warm and weightless suspended and out of time like a fly in amber she is thousands of miles from here and miles above me ghosting the stratosphere heading from new york to london though it is late even at that height i know her light is on her window a square of gold as she reads mysteries above the atlantic i watch the line of black tile on the pool ’ s floor leading me down the lane if she looks down by moonlight under a clear sky she will see black water she will see me swimming distantly moving far from shore suspended with her in flight through the wide gulf as we swim toward land together
i am offering this poem to you since i have nothing else to give keep it like a warm coat when winter comes to cover you or like a pair of thick socks the cold can not bite through i love you i have nothing else to give you so it is a pot full of yellow corn to warm your belly in winter it is a scarf for your head to wear over your hair to tie up around your face i love you keep it treasure this as you would if you were lost needing direction in the wilderness life becomes when mature and in the corner of your drawer tucked away like a cabin or hogan in dense trees come knocking and i will answer give you directions and let you warm yourself by this fire rest by this fire and make you feel safe i love you it ’ s all i have to give and all anyone needs to live and to go on living inside when the world outside no longer cares if you live or die remember i love you
let the musicians begin let every instrument awaken and instruct us in love ’ s willing river and love ’ s dear discipline we wait silent in consent and in the penance of patience awaiting the serene exaltation which is the liberation and conclusion of expiation now may the chief musician say “ lust and emulation have dwelt amoung us like barbarous kings have conquered us have inhabited our hearts devoured and ravished —with the savage greed and avarice of fire— the substance of pity and compassion. ” now may all the players play “ the river of the morning the morning of the river flow out of the splendor of the tenderness of surrender. ” now may the chief musician say “ nothing is more important than summer. ” and now the entire choir shall chant “ how often the astonished heart beholding the laurel remembers the dead and the enchanted absolute snow ’ s kingdom sleep ’ s dominion. ” then shall the chief musician declare “ the phoenix is the meaning of the fruit until the dream is knowledge and knowledge is a dream. ” and then once again the entire choir shall cry in passionate unity singing and celebrating love and love ’ s victory ascending and descending the heights of assent climbing and chanting triumphantly before the morning was you were before the snow shone and the light sang and the stone abiding rode the fullness or endured the emptiness you were you were alone
a stranger came to the door at eve and he spoke the bridegroom fair he bore a green-white stick in his hand and for all burden care he asked with the eyes more than the lips for a shelter for the night and he turned and looked at the road afar without a window light the bridegroom came forth into the porch with ‘ let us look at the sky and question what of the night to be stranger you and i. ’ the woodbine leaves littered the yard the woodbine berries were blue autumn yes winter was in the wind ‘ stranger i wish i knew. ’ within the bride in the dusk alone bent over the open fire her face rose-red with the glowing coal and the thought of the heart ’ s desire the bridegroom looked at the weary road yet saw but her within and wished her heart in a case of gold and pinned with a silver pin the bridegroom thought it little to give a dole of bread a purse a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god or for the rich a curse but whether or not a man was asked to mar the love of two by harboring woe in the bridal house the bridegroom wished he knew
they are human after all you think as the waiter steps up to a table out of sight of you reserved corner table— they too are thin-skinned and pleasure-seeking with their own feelings and their own sufferings you ’ re not so all alone in your mess your restlessness your shakes they too will be full of doubt dither shilly-shallying even if it ’ s all about making deals the universal-human albeit in its commercial manifestations but present there too truly the grief of hearts is ubiquitous and unending but whether they were ever in love outwith the awful wedded bed burning athirst desert-parched for the nectar of a faraway mouth sinking drowning in the impossibility of a union of souls— you won ’ t know nor can you ask the waiter who ’ s just ringing up another bock always avid for coupons to quench a thirst of another nature though also deep
out through the fields and the woods and over the walls i have wended i have climbed the hills of view and looked at the world and descended i have come by the highway home and lo it is ended the leaves are all dead on the ground save those that the oak is keeping to ravel them one by one and let them go scraping and creeping out over the crusted snow when others are sleeping and the dead leaves lie huddled and still no longer blown hither and thither the last lone aster is gone the flowers of the witch hazel wither the heart is still aching to seek but the feet question ‘ whither ’ ah when to the heart of man was it ever less than a treason to go with the drift of things to yield with a grace to reason and bow and accept the end of a love or a season
here in the electric dusk your naked lover tips the glass high and the ice cubes fall against her teeth it 's beautiful susan her hair sticky with gin our lady of wet glass-rings on the album cover streaming with hatred in the heat as the record falls and the snake-band chords begin to break like terrible news from the rolling stones and such a last light—full of spheres and zones august you 're just an erotic hallucination just so much feverishly produced kazoo music are you serious —this large oven impersonating night this exhaustion mutilated to resemble passion the bogus moon of tenderness and magic you hold out to each prisoner like a cup of light
i was conceived in the cruelest month in whatever spring california could muster a little rain—with some more likely and the buckeyes were they yet on the ground damn my father ’ s smooth stone eyes other prevailing enticements and what eliot called the female stench damn the oaks their histrionics struggling in the fog spiderwebs lay in the grass misted and looking like misspent galaxies i cry into and out of this moment pound told eliot strike this and this what was weak got dropped and the poem stood stronger without it
a good way to fall in love is to turn off the headlights and drive very fast down dark roads another way to fall in love is to say they are only mints and swallow them with a strong drink then it is autumn in the body your hands are cold then it is winter and we are still at war the gold-haired girl is singing into your ear about how we live in a beautiful country snow sifts from the clouds into your drink it doesn ’ t matter about the war a good way to fall in love is to close up the garage and turn the engine on then down you ’ ll fall through lovely mists as a body might fall early one morning from a high window into love love the broken glass love the scissors and the water basin a good way to fall is with a rope to catch you a good way is with something to drink to help you march forward the gold-haired girl says don ’ t worry about the armies says we live in a time full of love you ’ re thinking about this too much slow down nothing bad will happen
she visits still too much dressed in aromas of fir needles mango mold i still get lost knowing she ’ s close me not getting younger or more conscious sometimes i fantasticate i ’ m broad awake her witchy presence waits for me to jump into her arms but then she ’ s just an incoherent ache in sleep ’ s freaked scenes i feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wrists vaporing nooses around my head and feet and genitals conjuring my drab hair into a party bowl of oiled desirable locks she makes me nervous but what would i do without her so long as i can ’ t have her i want her and this alarming manic frequency then again who wants to wake to change its pulped smelly suit of meat drawing flies my night-watch hot girl moon-maiden mom let me get just one night ’ s sleep without regret released from your foxy ticklish fondlings your latest smell of windblown fresh-cut grass
‘ they toil not neither do they spin. ’ one morn before me were three figures seen with bowèd necks and joinèd hands side-faced and one behind the other stepp ’ d serene in placid sandals and in white robes graced they pass ’ d like figures on a marble urn when shifted round to see the other side they came again as when the urn once more is shifted round the first seen shades return and they were strange to me as may betide with vases to one deep in phidian lore how is it shadows that i knew ye not how came ye muffled in so hush a mask was it a silent deep-disguisèd plot to steal away and leave without a task my idle days ripe was the drowsy hour the blissful cloud of summer-indolence benumb ’ d my eyes my pulse grew less and less pain had no sting and pleasure ’ s wreath no flower o why did ye not melt and leave my sense unhaunted quite of all but—nothingness a third time pass ’ d they by and passing turn ’ d each one the face a moment whiles to me then faded and to follow them i burn ’ d and ached for wings because i knew the three the first was a fair maid and love her name the second was ambition pale of cheek and ever watchful with fatiguèd eye the last whom i love more the more of blame is heap ’ d upon her maiden most unmeek — i knew to be my demon poesy they faded and forsooth i wanted wings o folly what is love and where is it and for that poor ambition it springs from a man ’ s little heart ’ s short fever-fit for poesy —no —she has not a joy — at least for me —so sweet as drowsy noons and evenings steep ’ d in honey ’ d indolence o for an age so shelter ’ d from annoy that i may never know how change the moons or hear the voice of busy common-sense and once more came they by —alas wherefore my sleep had been embroider ’ d with dim dreams my soul had been a lawn besprinkled o ’ er with flowers and stirring shades and baffled beams the morn was clouded but no shower fell tho ’ in her lids hung the sweet tears of may the open casement press ’ d a new-leaved vine let in the budding warmth and throstle ’ s lay o shadows ’ twas a time to bid farewell upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine so ye three ghosts adieu ye can not raise my head cool-bedded in the flowery grass for i would not be dieted with praise a pet-lamb in a sentimental farce fade softly from my eyes and be once more in masque-like figures on the dreamy urn farewell i yet have visions for the night and for the day faint visions there is store vanish ye phantoms from my idle spright into the clouds and never more return
1. of the gardens of adonis lydia i love most of all those fugitive roses that on the day they are born that very day must also die eternal for them the light of day they 're born when the sun is already high and die before apollo 's course across the visible sky is run we too of our lives must make one day we never know my lydia nor want to know of nights before or after the little while that we may last 2. to be great be whole nothing that 's you should you exaggerate or exclude in each thing be all give all you are in the least you ever do the whole moon because it rides so high is reflected in each pool
i o what a physical effect it has on me to dive forever into the light blue sea of your acquaintance ah but dearest friends like forms are finished as life has ends still it is beautiful when october is over and february is over to sit in the starch of my shirt and to dream of your sweet ways as if the world were a taxi you enter it then reply to no one “ let ’ s go five or six blocks. ” isn ’ t the blue stream that runs past you a translation from the russian aren ’ t my eyes bigger than love isn ’ t this history and aren ’ t we a couple of ruins is carthage pompeii is the pillow the bed is the sun what glues our heads together o midnight o midnight is love what we are or has happiness come to me in a private car that ’ s so very small i ’ m amazed to see it there 2 we walk through the park in the sun and you say “ there ’ s a spider of shadow touching the bench when morning ’ s begun. ” i love you i love you fame i love you raining sun i love you cigarettes i love you love i love you daggers i love smiles daggers and symbolism 3 inside the symposium of your sweetest look ’ s sunflower awning by the nurse-faced chrysanthemums childhood again represents a summer spent sticking knives into porcelain raspberries when china ’ s still a country oh king edward abdicated years later that ’ s exactly when if you were seventy thousand years old and i were a pill i know i could cure your headache like playing baseball in drinking-water as baskets of towels sweetly touch the bathroom floor o benches of nothing appear and reappear—electricity i ’ d love to be how you are as if the world were new and the selves were blue which we don until it ’ s dawn until evening puts on the gray hooded selves and the light brown selves of water your tear-colored nail polish kisses me and the lumberyard seems new as a calm on the sea where like pigeons i feel so mutated sad so breezed so revivified and still so unabdicated— not like an edge of land coming over the sea
the magic of numbers—1 how strange it was to hear the furniture being moved around in the apartment upstairs i was twenty-six and you were twenty-two the magic of numbers—2 you asked me if i wanted to run but i said no and walked on i was nineteen and you were seven the magic of numbers—3 yes but does x really like us we were both twenty-seven the magic of numbers—4 you look like jerry lewis 1950 the magic of numbers—5 grandfather and grandmother want you to go over to their house for dinner they were sixty-nine and i was two and a half the magic of numbers—6 one day when i was twenty-nine years old i met you and nothing happened the magic of numbers—7 no of course it wasn ’ t i who came to the library brown eyes flushed cheeks brown hair i was twenty-nine and you were sixteen the magic of numbers—8 after we made love one night in rockport i went outside and kissed the road i felt so carried away i was twenty-three and you were nineteen the magic of numbers—9 i was twenty-nine and so were you we had a very passionate time everything i read turned into a story about you and me and everything i did was turned into a poem
i love you as a sheriff searches for a walnut that will solve a murder case unsolved for years because the murderer left it in the snow beside a window through which he saw her head connecting with her shoulders by a neck and laid a red roof in her heart for this we live a thousand years for this we love and we live because we love we are not inside a bottle thank goodness i love you as a kid searches for a goat i am crazier than shirttails in the wind when you ’ re near a wind that blows from the big blue sea so shiny so deep and so unlike us i think i am bicycling across an africa of green and white fields always to be near you even in my heart when i ’ m awake which swims and also i believe that you are trustworthy as the sidewalk which leads me to the place where i again think of you a new harmony of thoughts i love you as the sunlight leads the prow of a ship which sails from hartford to miami and i love you best at dawn when even before i am awake the sun receives me in the questions which you always pose

love is more thicker than forget more thinner than recall more seldom than a wave is wet more frequent than to fail it is most mad and moonly and less it shall unbe than all the sea which only is deeper than the sea love is less always than to win less never than alive less bigger than the least begin less littler than forgive it is most sane and sunly and more it can not die than all the sky which only is higher than the sky
if i must worry about how i will live in my old age without wealth i would be without health now and how can i live to be old if i must worry about how i will live in my old age without love i would be without dreams now and how can i go on living another day allow me to sit in the sun and listen to the sky i will love you gently allow me to stay in my room and weave my rainbows i will love you truly like a colt in the meadow with no boundary allow me to wander around till i hear the autumn stealthily strolling by my door i will be waiting to be with you then
awakened from a dream i curl up and turn the roses on the dresser smile and your words bloom the red roses for valentine ’ s day like in a film thoughts of you unfold moment by moment i vaguely hear the sound of your spoon scooping cereal the water stream in the shower the buzzing noise of your electric razor like a singing of cicada your footsteps in and out of the bedroom your lips touching my cheek lightly and the sound of the door shutting in your light i fall asleep again under the warm quilt happily like a child upon waking on the kitchen counter i find a half grapefruit carefully cut and sectioned such a loving touch is a milestone for my newly found happiness
it 's neither red nor sweet it does n't melt or turn over break or harden so it ca n't feel pain yearning regret it does n't have a tip to spin on it is n't even shapely— just a thick clutch of muscle lopsided mute still i feel it inside its cage sounding a dull tattoo i want i want— but i ca n't open it there 's no key i ca n't wear it on my sleeve or tell you from the bottom of it how i feel here it 's all yours now— but you 'll have to take me too
“ oh where are you going with your love-locks flowing on the west wind blowing along this valley track ” “ the downhill path is easy come with me an it please ye we shall escape the uphill by never turning back. ” so they two went together in glowing august weather the honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right and dear she was to dote on her swift feet seemed to float on the air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight “ oh what is that in heaven where gray cloud-flakes are seven where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt ” “ oh that ’ s a meteor sent us a message dumb portentous an undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt. ” “ oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly their scent comes rich and sickly ” — “ a scaled and hooded worm. ” “ oh what ’ s that in the hollow so pale i quake to follow ” “ oh that ’ s a thin dead body which waits the eternal term. ” “ turn again o my sweetest —turn again false and fleetest this beaten way thou beatest i fear is hell ’ s own track. ” “ nay too steep for hill-mounting nay too late for cost-counting this downhill path is easy but there ’ s no turning back ”
red the skim on the surface of your soup or the cut on your plate in the café des anges juices swamping the willow-pattern skiff as she dabs her mouth with her napkin your blind blind date leaving a smudge lipstick-and-gore though there ’ s still a worm of gristle in the gap between her teeth mood music candlelight wine low voices in a world of harm the creature brought down hindquarters heavy hind legs broken by the dogs its head held up eyes wide the tangle and drag as a gralloch knife unpegs the bulk all slippage and seepage and the way she thumbs a morsel into your mouth or smiles your smile back at you lets you know that everything ’ s just as it seems then back at the small hotel she strips off quicker than you might have hoped pink as a new-skinned cat all too eager to have you by heart her cry tells you nothing new purple surely what first comes to mind is purpill and pall no so is it what she is said to have said that night when she breathed a secret and put the whole room on stall not that then it must have something to do with the way in the fairy tale when the twins are lost in the wood daylight suddenly deepens and it ’ s run or stay or pray still wrong rain in the hanging gardens then that bruise you can ’ t account for the color of money win or lose a balkan liqueur that hits you where—ah yes of course the bruise black you know the room or think you do half-dark and windowless it seems though maybe the shutters are dropped against the day loose talk from women in veils and something like a pulse on the air when he opens the door and slips straight in the loden coat the old slouch hat the harelip so who else could it be right on time and keen to help think back to those promises all of them straight from the heart never asked for never kept the skin trade there ’ s a knack it ’ s been a lifetime coming but now you understand or think you do why what you wanted wasn ’ t what you planned they bring a tray to your bedside you eat from his hand blue it sings they say and so it does something like the note that fractures glass or gets so far below the range of human hearing that it jolts your heart and the glass it breaks is blue and that ’ s a blue note for sure from the guy on the alto sax in the basement dive which is where they ’ re bound to meet up in the classic noir the private eye the girl with a shadowy past the old-style cop and it ’ s nigh-on certain she ’ ll have to take a bullet or we ’ ll see her in prison blue as they lead her to the drop the fragments of glass were part of it too that ’ s plain though no one noticed just as they failed to spot how the crucifix in her bedroom made sense of the subtle stain on her cocktail dress and in this the director ’ s cut the dive is deeper the saxophone sadder the cop bent as a dog ’ s hind leg the girl a scheming slut and the gumshoe comes in late with the one and only clue that would finally set things straight though its true meaning is hidden from him and lost on you green that misericord with the ugly little fucker at the moment in his dance when slap-and-tickle has become a serious matter and no one ’ s quicker in getting his hand up the skirt of some “ ladye fayre ” who returns to hearth and home with the rub of the green on her back for all to see and devil-may-care his smell still on her reek of the barley mow and hers on him which could have been sloe or sweat and sandalwood but you ’ d be the one to know

some day when trees have shed their leaves and against the morning ’ s white the shivering birds beneath the eaves have sheltered for the night we ’ ll turn our faces southward love toward the summer isle where bamboos spire the shafted grove and wide-mouthed orchids smile and we will seek the quiet hill where towers the cotton tree and leaps the laughing crystal rill and works the droning bee and we will build a cottage there beside an open glade with black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near and ferns that never fade
all dark morning long the clouds are rising slowly up beneath us and we are fast asleep the mountains unmove intensely and so do we meadows look down a city there looks up and stirs a little adrift the rolling tiled roofs of buildings the deadly trains of grinding sand and morning— a spy unfolds his paper the coffee ’ s served a bride and groom stand shivering on a tarmac in the mist and they are happy each one and all of us entangled the room is moist with us the house unfinished windowless and we are fast asleep the brother of the groom can ’ t get close enough he leans against the brightest ridge and ladder the sucking sound of memory as heaven picks up speed and hurtles through his burning skin its frozen blankets to the sun

record no oiled tongue diary— note my lantern bruises the low clouds with light the evening we talked almonds in a bowl she ate none i did not bid her remove her dark gloves as sometime before she had done her dress not so clean as before a last brand not rescued to flame— no billow but breath and breath too short a line to twine our hands in marriage i left a last time her in widow ’ s silk— my lantern clothed in morning dawns on this road so late tonight the white birches i believe i believe i could have loved her her white wrists white the birch trees by lantern bared black gloves pulled off at night become the night do you hear that pulse the deer wander between her hands glean fallen seed at hand bed down in fallen needles and grass those green discs afloat in the night are their eyes caught in lantern light can it be so many wake the forest glows with sight see and am seen a pulse at the stump is breath and rest and breath again infinite in store the game of this land note the plumage of the turkey note the thick meat at breast sap syrup pine plank a copse of wood is cord for furnace a copse is cottage too the owl in the hollow tree screeches because i am too close to truth note the almond tree overmuch with fruit the almond pressed is oil sweet the almond bit is a smoky meat that leaves—note it the tongue bathed in oil
the towels rot and disgust me on this damp peninsula where they invented mist and drug abuse and taught the light to fade where my top-quality and rock-bottom heart cried because i 'll never get to kiss your famous knees again in a room made vague by throwing a scarf over a lamp things get pretty radical in the dark the sailboats on the inlet sail away the provinces of actuality crawl on the sea the dusk now tenderly ministers to the fallen parking lots— the sunset instananeous on the fenders memory and peace the grip of chaos
the night the world was going to end when we heard those explosions not far away and the loudspeakers telling us about the vast fires on the backwater consuming undisclosed remnants and warning us over and over to stay indoors and make no signals you stood at the open window the light of one candle back in the room we put on high boots to be ready for wherever we might have to go and we got out the oysters and sat at the small table feeding them to each other first with the fork then from our mouths to each other until there were none and we stood up and started to dance without music slowly we danced around and around in circles and after a while we hummed when the world was about to end all those years all those nights ago
the nightclub ’ s neon light glows red with anxiety as i wait on the turning lane cars blur past their headlights white as charcoal i trust each driver not to swerve i trust each stranger not to kill me and let me cross the shadow of his smoky path trust is all i have for patrons at the bar one man offers me a line one man buys the kamikaze another drinks it yet another wraps his arm around my waist i trust him not to harm my body as much as he expects his body to remain unharmed one man asks me to the dance floor one asks me to a second drink another asks me home i dance i drink i follow i can trust a man without clothes naked he conceals no weapons no threat but the blood in his erection his bed unfamiliar only temporarily pillows without loyalty absorb the weight of any man betray the scent of the men who came before i trust a stranger ’ s tongue to tell me nothing valuable it makes no promises of truth or lies it doesn ’ t swear commitments the stranger ’ s hands take their time exploring undisguised they do not turn to claws or pretend artistic skill to draw configurations on my flesh they are only human hands with fingertips unsentimental with discoveries without nostalgia for what they leave behind i trust this stranger not to stay inside me once he enters me i trust him to release me from the blame of pleasure the pain i exit with no greater than the loneliness that takes me to the bar he says good night i give him back those words taking nothing with me that is his the front door shuts behind me the gravel driveway ushers me away the rearview mirror loses sight of threshold house sidewalk street driving by the nightclub i pass a car impatient on the turning lane my hands are cold and itch to swerve the wheel to brand his fender with the fury of my headlights but i let this stranger live to struggle through the heat and sweat of false affections anonymous and borrowed like the glass that washed my prints to hold another patron ’ s drink
timing ’ s everything the vapor rises high in the sky tossing to and fro then freezes suddenly and crystalizes into a perfect flake of miraculous snow for countless miles drifting east above the world whirling about in a swirling free- for-all appearing aimless just like love but sensing seeking out its destiny falling to where the two young skaters stand hand in hand then flips and dips and whips itself about to ever-so-gently land a miracle across her unkissed lips as he blocks the wind raging from the south leaning forward to kiss her lovely mouth
after thomas james the strangers in the woods must mimic squirrels and crackle with the undergrowth they must not flinch at the cruelty of breaking golden leaves with their feet or of interring stones and like any of these deciduous trees in autumn they must be stingy with shadow and move deceptively across the sludge i listen to these strangers stirring with the evenings i invent paths for them to the soft edge of the lake each descent is as graceful as a sinking ship but less tragic somehow because these strangers don ’ t possess a lung i can not hear them breathe yet the air is all whispers all sighs—the same ethereal muscle that rubs the color off the foliage i lost my way out of the woods on the night every bird went south or numb a plump rat snatched the moon and dragged it by the white rope of its tail the strangers were a cloak of silhouettes flattening against a trunk like bark i must have disappeared among them because the mouth i touched was not my own and was cruelly closing in on someone ’ s rib i carried such a bite on me an arc of green and yellow on my side from the man who said he loved me in that darkness i knew as much about him as i did of the amputee swimming his way up the hill with his only arm so this is the home of the unturned stone where the fugitive keeps his kiss archeologists will discover a paradise in the place no touch died of neglect is it any wonder all things forgotten or abandoned find their way here the winter is back so too the bloated body of a book i tossed over the bridge last week and there on the bench is my old smoking habit a cigarette glowing on my mouth like a beacon i ’ m patient waiting for the fugitive to claim me as his own i ’ m as wise as any stranger here alone but with the knowledge that the grief of separation is always brief

turning your back you button your blouse that ’ s new you redirect the conversation a man has entered it your therapist has given you permission to discuss this with me the word you ’ ve been looking for in desire you can now say “ heterosexual ” with me we mean different things when we say it i mean the life i left behind forever for you it ’ s a new beginning a stab at being normal again a desire to enter the world with a man instead of a woman and of course there ’ s the word you won ’ t claim for yourself anymore you who have children to think of you who have put me in line behind them and mean to keep the order clear it ’ s really my word against yours anymore in this new language in this battle over how a man is about to enter this closed room of desire we ’ ve gingerly exchanged keys to but desire isn ’ t what ’ s at issue anyway you say to me instead i learn a man can protect you in a way a woman only means to but never can and my world is too new when there ’ s real life out there word after word for how normal looks each word cutting like scissors a profile of desire— a man facing a woman nothing particularly new or interesting to me i ’ ve wanted only to face you and the world simultaneously say what i mean with my body my choice to not be a man to be a woman with you forget the man ’ s part or how his body is the word for what touch can contain what love means if this were only about desire you say i ’ d still desire you but it isn ’ t passion we ’ re defining new consequences emerge when a man and desire are part of the words we hurl you changing how you mean loving—this terrible final news

he snapped his lighter shut placed it beside the metronome on his nightstand we ’ d just made love and i was sitting naked on the edge of his bed watching the stars appear he told me my skin was chatoyant in the window light like wet fiddleback maple i asked him what chatoyant meant he grinned and explained growth distortion how it could pattern the wood fibers into flames of alternating tones i told him that was nice and he said he could take me to the workshop for a look around show me what he was talking about i rolled my eyes it sounded so boring but then he bit into my thigh and said he wanted to fashion me into a beautiful cello he drove with both hands on the wheel and told me he thought of everyone as instruments he said his father was filled with knots like a burl and only good for music boxes but his mother was quilted beneath her surface like rippled river water then he just stared ahead at the road and kept quiet the rest of the way when we got inside he felt along the wall and flipped a switch so i could see the three white torsos each with a headstock and fretboard attached to the sternum they were displayed on hangers like guitars i covered my mouth with a shaking hand backed away and ran out to the parking lot he stood at the door and watched me squeal away in his pickup the sky clouded over as i drove to the police station all the millions of stars like birds ’ eyes like the darkness was sawn off the trunk of a black walnut tree then sliced into a veneer

after erik satie for an hour i forgot my fat self my neurotic innards my addiction to alignment for an hour i forgot my fear of rain for an hour i was a salamander shimmying through the kelp in search of shore and under his fingers the notes slid loose from my belly in a long jellyrope of eggs that took root in the mud and what would hatch i did not know— a lie a waltz an apostle of glass for an hour i stood on two legs and ran for an hour i panted and galloped for an hour i was a maple tree and under the summer of his fingers the notes seeded and winged away in the clutch of small elegant helicopters

to have gold in your back yard and not know it i woke this morning before your dream had shredded and found a curious thing flowers made of gold six-sided—more than that—broken on flagstones petals the color of a wedding band you are sleeping the morning comes up gold perhaps i made those flowers in my head for i have counted snowflakes in july blowing across my eyes like bits of calcium and i have stepped into your dream at night a stranger there my body steeped in moonlight i watched you tremble washed in all that silver love the stars have fallen into the garden and turned to frost they have opened like a hand it is the color that breaks out of the bedsheets this morning the garden is littered with dry petals as yellow as the page of an old book i step among them they are brittle as bone china
harry loves myrtle—he has strong arms from the warehouse and on sunday when they take the bus to emerald meadows he does n't say '' what will your chastity amount to when your flesh withers in a little while '' no on sunday when they picnic in emerald meadows they look at the sunday paper girl slays banker-betrayer they spread it around on the grass bath-tub stirs jersey row and then they sit down on it nice harry does n't say `` ziggin 's ointment for withered flesh cures thousands of men and women of moles warts red veins flabby throat scalp and hair diseases not expensive and fully guaranteed '' no harry says nothing at all he smiles and they kiss in the emerald meadows on the sunday paper
two shall be born the whole world wide apart and speak in different tongues and pay their debts in different kinds of coin and give no heed each to the other ’ s being and know not that each might suit the other to a t if they were but correctly introduced and these unconsciously shall bend their steps escaping spaniards and defying war unerringly toward the same trysting-place albeit they know it not until at last they enter the same door and suddenly they meet and ere they ’ ve seen each other ’ s face they fall into each other ’ s arms upon the broadway cable car – and this is fate
the palm tree exposes a large number of loose carved spines out of pleasure boredom to start over in the carved moment is to take cover a solid short woman in a pink wool suit proceeds— anxiously doggedly alone up a sidewalk laid down for her we don ’ t believe it there are two kinds of choices pirate sources say unconscious and desperate
even when your friend the radio is still even when her dream the magazine is finished even when his life the ticker is silent even when their destiny the boulevard is bare and after that paradise the dance-hall is closed after that theater the clinic is dark still there will be your desire and hers and his hopes and theirs your laughter their laughter your curse and his curse her reward and their reward their dismay and his dismay and her dismay and yours— even when your enemy the collector is dead even when your counsellor the salesman is sleeping even when your sweetheart the movie queen has spoken even when your friend the magnate is gone
i am not a poet sonya i inspect the fragrant feet of younger ladies— while deafness hums as a little motor i watch her stand in the shower holding her breasts in her hands like two small explosions i am her boy drowning in this country he does not know the word for “ drowning ” and yells “ i am diving for the last time ”
what if we got outside ourselves and there really was an outside out there not just our insides turned inside out what if there really were a you beyond me not just the waves off my own fire like those waves off the backyard grill you can see the next yard through though not well -- just enough to know that off to the right belongs to someone else not you what if when we said i love you there were a you to love as there is a yard beyond to walk past the grill and get to to endure the endless walk through the self knowing through a bond that has no basis for ourselves are all we know is altruism not giving but coming to know someone is there through the wavy vision of the self 's heat love become a decision
to jk those scars rooted me stigmata stalagmite i sat at a drive-in and watched the stars through a straw while the coke in my lap went waterier and waterier for days on end or nights no end i crawled on all fours or in my case no fours to worship you amoeba behemoth —then you explained your dna calls for meaner genes than mine and since you are merely so to speak its external expression etcet ergo among your lovers i ’ ll never be ... ah that movie was so faraway the stars melting made my thighs icy i see it ’ s not you who is not requiting me it ’ s something in you over which you have no say says no to me
when the beautiful young man drowned— accidentally swimming at dawn in a current too swift for him or obedient to some cult of total immersion that promised the bather would come up divine mortality rinsed from him— hadrian placed his image everywhere a marble antinoüs staring across the public squares where a few dogs always scuffled planted in every squalid little crossroads at the furthest corners of the empire what do we want in any body but the world and if the lover ’ s inimitable form was nowhere then he would find it everywhere though the boy became simply more dead as the sculptors embodied him wherever hadrian might travel the beloved figure would be there first the turn of his shoulders the exact marble nipples the drowned face not really lost to the nile—which has no appetite merely takes in anything without judgment or expectation— but lost into its own multiplication an artifice rubbed with oils and acid so that the skin might shine which of these did i love here is his hair here his hair again here the chiseled liquid waist i hold because i can not hold it if only one of you he might have said to any of the thousand marble boys anywhere would speak or the statues might have been enough the drowned boy blurred as much by memory as by water molded toward an essential remote ideal longing of course become its own object the way that desire can make anything into a god

to pass through astonishment and know much too late and because habit makes us strange i find myself searching on a landscape that generates questions beyond its ability to solve that dark post out there might be this poem standing as you would — lead in the 4th grade play — under theater lights and your shadows that petal around you and what should be most memorable isn ’ t so i recall those prolonged moments of silence incongruous and revealing as metaphor most frequently for instance waiting at the bus stop in pai in a midmorning the hue of the roadside guardrails that dot the cliff ’ s side like morse code before leaving with trees those felled ones half-painted white the burnt trunks ... that passed by like the so many phenomena of our days blurred together into a motion at times convincing as a nickelodeon ’ s i waited under the thatched roof of the station with other travelers with each in our common solitude risen around like that haydn piece in the tunnel i descended into on my way out onto broadway from the 1 train some months ago it seemed of hopper star fruit on the ground discolored withering blighted three of the town ’ s strays hobbled by before midday ’ s heat stalled the town like some lost stephano trinculo and their lamed dark sycophant — at least that ’ s what they were for me it wasn ’ t comfort never comfort but something else and when each moment with expectations for more than it can hold leads to the next and soon — as then — expectation fills up the day as does your breath a balloon the day floats with such care and strange hours and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul ... plato wrote — poetry ’ s banisher beauty ’ s guard 2 my hands grow differently used while one hand thumbs pages the other hand steadies open the book it ’

last us a run-through of the temple and in the first hallway — him his phatic calls tics and unwilled smile facing the morning that just passed the sun no longer in front of his propped body but above it the valley overabundant with the real light that stole our day the fog too lifted against my sight we paused having just climbed the hill we agreed to leave our shoes on despite sandals stationed on the stoop and then we turned towards that hall “ let ’ s go ” he ends befriended prayer phaedrus-empty — the driver gases the bus off the parking brakes to idle back out the station the attendants scoop up the wood wedges and clatter the door shut the passengers all shift in the chapter among the deformed and footless zhuangzi ends arguing for the greatest of men a man void of feelings “ the

1 what ’ s the word she cries from her purchase on the iron finial of the front gate to my heart the radio in the kitchen is stuck in the year i was born the capitals of the world are burning and this sparrow with a woman ’ s face roars in the burdened air — air crowded with voices but no word mobbed with talking but no word teeming with speech but no word — this woman with the body of a bird is shrieking fierce buzzed volts in the swarming babble what ’ s the word this evening is the year of my birth the country has just gained its independence social unrest grows rampant as the economy declines under a corrupt government of the army and the rich come years of mass poverty decades of starving children and racially-fueled mayhem word is armed squads raping women by the hundreds word is beheadings public lynchings and riots word is burning looting curfews and shoot-to-kill orders and word is more deadly days lie ahead today tomorrow and yesterday the forecast calls for more misery more poverty more starvation more families fleeing their homes more refugees streaming toward every border more horror is to come that ’ s the word more scapegoating is to come that ’ s the word more violence is to come on the roads in the streets in the homes violence in the churches in the temples where they preach who to love and who to hate how to get to heaven and who to leave behind how to don the fleece of the blameless and prosecute your neighbor all against all is to come that ’ s the word who hasn ’ t heard that she spits you call yourself a poet you tame high finisher of paltry blots you publish doubt and call it knowledge you destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify your envy you murder benevolence and virtue with condescension you pretend to poetry and destroy imagination your words mystify mislead and misdirect you ape the word made flesh with words made words to multiply more words and words about your words and you ritualize these sterile pleasures miming joy delight and generation you celebrate cheap distractions your theories bloom in suicide of the mind starvation of the heart and mass maladies of the soul you mock and mimic sincerity you read and divine by irony you snare the little ones you pose stumbling blocks to the lame you dig pits for the blind you sell desolation your science is despair what ’ s the word i can tell she ’ s up to no good this feathered interval monument to the nano this deciding gram my geronimo she ’ s out to overturn an empire to usurp principalities and powers just by swooping into the right assembly perplexing a senate baffling a parliament or bewildering somebody ’ s crosshairs not worth a farthing and without a cent she would own the realm her shrill cries measure trading dying for being i tell her i sang in a church choir during one war north american tv made famous i fled a burning archipelago in the rain on my mother ’ s back in another war nobody televised in the midst of wars worldwide many in countries whose names i can ’ t pronounce i tucked christ ’ s promise and adam ’ s disgrace together with my pajamas under my pillow each morning unable to distinguish which was god ’ s first

say and there is the word every word is a fluctuating flame to a wick that dies but the word the word is a ruling sum and drastic mean the standard that travels without moving words move but the word is fixed the true blank the word is the voice of the lamp and words are soot blackening the glass the movements of words engender time and death but the word lives outside of time and death inside time death rules life is death ’ s kingdom we live at dying ’ s rate words are a sop for death but the word is the mother of thresholds regulating life and death the word begets presences impossible to confirm given the blinding action of time and the sea and the earth ’ s turning repose and who is that supposed to feed whose thirst would that quench she screeches her voice materializing a greater body of innumerable birds arriving at dominion increasing to overwhelm every mile of my heart that bloody aerie branching and leafing her feathers become all eyes and mouths her voice coming

shut eye we name beginning the word sleeps and all is darkness an open eye we name the treasure the word wakes and voices are heard among the sounds of water the word dreams and worlds appear and stars beyond and behind our eyes and the moon with its hair tied up and its hair let down bound on every side and wide open in the center the word hosts our breath our span the space of our dreaming and our thinking our stillness and our moving and the emerging present is one of its bodies the fulcrum the eye the heart enthroned the dove without person homing the word is a hammer raining down its songs a river pouring out of the mouth of the anvil twin and unlike the word is without peer black and white it is a wheeling pair of coincident opposites turning on a point existence and nonexistence hand in hand substance and void begetting life and death the word is an open book and its first and last pages are missing it is a brother and sister telling each other the missing parts of one another ’ s stories it is the lover and the beloved constantly changing places in the fire and it is the wind in the treetops outside our window a voice torn to pieces hear it the wind without a house she says time without a gate she says a memory of the ocean torments the trees a homesickness she says the wind is leafing through both of our histories looking for a happy ending it is my hand moving over your body i say finding more and more to know it is a circle of women reciting in the round the oldest stories of death disguised as a traveler or overlooked familiar friend we shunned for less faithful playmates it is a house and from inside come the voices of children taking turns reading to one another it is their own story they read but why do their voices seem uneasy does the moon giant at the window frighten them does death run amok through all the pages of the story do the pages turn by themselves are there strangers in the house is the house burning soldiers with guns are at our door again sister quick change into a penny i ’ ll fold you in a handkerchief put you in my pocket and jump inside a sack of rice one of the uncooked kernels men with knives are looking in our windows again brother hurry turn yourself into one of our mother ’ s dolls sitting on the living room shelf i ’ ll be the dust settling on your eyelids the ones wearing wings are in the yard the ones adorned with lightning are in the house the ones decorated with stars are dividing our futures among them don ’ t answer when they call to us in the voice of nanny don ’ t believe them when they promise sugar don ’ t come out until evening or when you hear our mother weeping to herself if only i could become the mirror in her purse i ’ d never come back until the end of time 3 the treetops buck and heave in the night wind like drunks at sea leaning too far over a rocking bulwark like a woman throwing her green and gold hair in time to a song only she can hear and from inside that windswept bulk growing darker comes a frenzied uproar of what must be hundreds of hidden birds all that noise of wind leaves and branches all that uttering from unseen throats and is there no word all that shrieking iterating crying in the rustling leaves all that screaming shrilling running din of squeaky wheels radiant numbers of tongues beaks hubs wings spokes keening in centrifugal spinning and not one word not any nor part no bearing one hunger a fanned fire roars in the voice of the sea one light eats itself unconsumed the wind is taking the night apart she says the wind is dismantling the leaves the branches the minutes our listening and finding more and more moving pieces to index our hands our mouths our voices recurring stairs of an imperfect past a rumored present figures multiplying inside a mirror each alone in his dream of the world i say is host and guest a book and the one who reads it by the light of a vanished childhood don ’ t say that she says we see by the light of who we are look at us you inside me inside you we ’ ve lived inside each other from the beginning and from before beginning before the world was ever found before the world was found i say i dwelled inside you and you breathed all through me in my body and its happiness in my body and its loneliness after i found the world i had to go looking for you ever since the world i only lose you and find you lose you and find you the body of the beloved is the lover ’ s true homeland she says i can hear you but i can ’ t hear me i say your voice a burning gown of song and time and me with my ghosts me with my mockingbird don ’ t say that she says what is my mind i wonder but the reflected light of your voice o burning one o seeing voice o speaking eye that renders us now legible now indecipherable now strangers traveling under assumed names don ’ t say that she says look a single page of the wind copied by hand is the volume of despair the smallest living wing displaces and your voice will be your cup each day my wings shelter your dear momentary earth my mind is several minds i say each abiding differently in your eyes in the smell of your hair in your voice moving over me in my voice moving over you she says don ’ t look at your hands watch the shadows they make i say moving over you my voice crosses out of forbidden chambers of the emperor of china through chronicles of exile and death in a foreign country to touch the ground i touch in me when i speak to you she says a new mind makes the world new true words are a little blue and being human makes the saddest music in the world she says postpone all morning bells the ore lies awake inside the rock a dream of origin waiting to be rescued i say the glare of your nakedness confounds me a distraction from the darker incandescence of your being inside you is the safest place to be the radio in the kitchen is stuck in the year i was born the capitals of the world are burning and of all the things on my mind this evening words weigh the least death weighs the most and your voice ’ s body beneath my voice ’ s moving hand is a green agent of freedom and law best friend to my earth and my ache of all the things keeping me from sleep words weigh too much yet not enough time weighs nothing at all but i can ’ t bear it and your body burdened by minutes and ancient rites is my favorite sad song one wave that gives rise to three shoulder hip and knee your body is the lord ’ s pure geometry disguised as time your body is tears lilies and the mouth of the falls and of all the things we ’ re dying from tonight being alive is the strangest surviving our histories is the saddest time leaves the smallest wounds and your body a mortal occasion of timeless law is all the word i know

woman much missed how you call to me call to me saying that now you are not as you were when you had changed from the one who was all to me but as at first when our day was fair can it be you that i hear let me view you then standing as when i drew near to the town where you would wait for me yes as i knew you then even to the original air-blue gown or is it only the breeze in its listlessness travelling across the wet mead to me here you being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness heard no more again far or near thus i faltering forward leaves around me falling wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward and the woman calling
you get over these constant storms and learn to be married all over again every day —barry hannah the foyer is hers because the kettle is hers as it was made for water and the water is hers because the sac that grew the baby was hers though the semen that made the sac was his like his boots are his and the tea that ’ s of the kettle after it enters his mouth is his unless it ’ s hers since it ’ s inside the kitchen that ’ s hers and therefore not his unless he ’ s simmering the asian sauces that are his because they ’ re dense and knotty rather than milkish and paltry like everything else from the nation state of the motherland of the no-mercy child who won ’ t stop sucking and wanting and whining in the ear that is his although the child herself belongs somehow to the woman and thus its hunger is hers as is the bed and dresser and mirror and latch though the hammer naturally is his and the saw and lumber and back and muscle he suffered to build because he guessed he thought it would be good for something besides this house like a pestilence of people who weren ’ t his because nothing was his except the whirl he carried in his belly of the mix-up of loving her in the first place like being sucked into a burrow of lava embers and putting your tongue to it until it caught fire and all he could say was that the burn was his—this hole in the mouth— this fiasco of the woman bent now in the garden to smell the cilantro as though she didn ’ t know his head was split with hating her and loving her and hating her and loving her because she was an ache and a kink and somehow the furrow—the groove and the rut— and age and death and kiss and fuck and not-fuck and song and not-song and no it was not sweet though he ’ d go on and carry it since also—since mostly—it was

it ’ s a wave isn ’ t it not a particle a fresh cool wave so why am i flushed and not washed why dirtier than before 1. etymology on the subject of our names they ’ re so embracing thinking they ’ re all us and swallowing themselves into our nausea yet we never quite die on the spot we put off being what we ’ re called we take the hint time is never wasted it is always spent 2. teleology sheer fabric trailing through 4 a.m. i thought it was opaque and earlier 3. mathematics i know you know i know and the mirror multiplies inside the world is no bigger but next time do the math because i wanted to know none of what i now know twice 4. the principle of the borg saying “ there ’ s no one like me ” accomplishes the exact opposite of what you mean it is true only insofar as it is true for everyone equally so it means you are not special in any way which should be enough for you 5. documentary this clothing a maladaptive wrapping cuts me up i am a vignette floated knowingly since i pulled myself through myself like a unitard too many eyeholes have been cut and pieced together to make flesh less various with others 6. medicine the cure for embarrassment is substitution strap don ’ t pluck baldness makes headlines use grass use less shorts under your skirt for recess redo the surfaces of your wrong turns to make taking them smoother in the future 7. cosmology things are less embarrassing at the cellular level remember we were a whole part of the universe before mother busted the party before we were ourselves now like dirty soap we attract what we repel 8. apology even the clumsiest fate is perfectly shaped so the view took over looking but the sweetest thing i ’ ve ever known is obscene with a beautiful sugar rotted down to its truth loving you a serious accidental shame and day flatulates into night trips and falls in front of millions into morning in thrall to this pocus the end of fear starts with such an annihilating blush with such a stutter
where you are tender you speak your plural roland barthes 1 one version of the story is i wish you back— that i used each evening evening out what all day spent wrinkling i bought a dress that was so extravagantly feminine you could see my ovaries through it this is how i thought i would seduce you this is how frantic i hollowed out 2 another way of telling it is to hire some kind of gnarled and symbolic troll to make a tape recording of plastic beads coming unglued from a child ’ s jewelry box this might be an important sound like serotonin or mighty mitochondria so your body hears about how you stole the ring made from a glittery opiate and the locket that held candy 3 it ’ s only fair that i present yet another side as insidious as it is because two sides hold up nothing but each other a tentacled skepticism a suspended contempt such fancies and toxins form a third wall a mean way to end and i never dreamed we meant it 4 another way of putting it is like slathering jam on a scrape do sweets soothe pain or simply make it stick which is the worst so much technology and no fix for sticky if you can ’ t taste it i mean there ’ s no relief unless so i ’ m coming all this excitement to your house to a place where there ’ s no room for play it is possible you ’ ll lock me out and i ’ ll finally focus on making mudcakes look solid in the rain 5 in some cultures the story told is slightly different— in that it is set in an aquarium and the audience participates as various fish the twist comes when it is revealed that the most personally attractive fish have eyes only on one side and repel each other like magnets the starfish is the size of an eraser and does as much damage starfish the eponymous and still unlikely hero has those five pink moving suckerpads that allow endless permutations so no solid memory no recent history nothing better left unsaid 6 the story exists even when there are no witnesses kissers tellers because secrets secrete and these versions tend to be slapstick as if in a candy factory the chocolate belted down the conveyor too fast or everyone turned sideways at the same time by accident this little tale tries so hard to be humorous wants so badly to win affection and to lodge because nothing is truly forgotten and loved 7 three million richards can ’ t be wrong so when they levy a critique of an undertaking which in their view overtakes i take it seriously they think one may start a tale off whingy and wretched in a regular voice but when one strikes out whimsically as if meta-is-better as if it isn ’ t you as if this story is happening to nobody it is only who you are fooling that ’ s nobody the richards believe you can not privately jettison into the sky just for fun you must stack stories from the foundation up from the sad heart and the feet tired of supporting it language is architecture after all not an air capsule not a hang glide this is real life so don ’ t invite anyone to a house that hasn ’ t been built because no one unbuilds meticulously and meticulosity is what allows hearing three million richards make one point i hear it in order to make others mistake 8 as it turns out there is a wrong way to tell this story i was wrong to tell you how muti-true everything is when it would be truer to say nothing i ’ ve invented so much and prevented more but i ’ d like to talk with you about other things in absolute quiet in extreme context to see you again isn ’ t love revision it could have gone so many ways this just one of the ways it went tell me another
the horse fell off the poem and the galilean women were wet with butterflies and dew dancing above chrysanthemum the two absent ones you and i you and i are the two absent ones a pair of white doves chatting on the branches of a holm oak no love but i love ancient love poems that guard the sick moon from smoke i attack and retreat like the violin in quatrains i get far from my time when i am near the topography of place ... there is no margin in modern language left to celebrate what we love because all that will be ... was the horse fell bloodied with my poem and i fell bloodied with the horse ’ s blood ...
i kissed a woman whose freckles aroused our neighbors her trembling lips meant come to bed her hair falling down in the middle of the conversation meant come to bed i walked in my hospital of thoughts yes i carried her off to bed on the chair of my hairy arms but parted lips meant kiss my parted lips i read those lips without understanding soft lips meant kiss my soft lips such is a silence of a woman who speaks against silence knowing silence is what moves us to speak
motionless forgetful music of women and men touching each forehead breathing a soul into each immeasurable other on earth where we are stranger through madness unattainable or grace in difficult traffic reaching for each immeasurable other no one on earth o bitterness o desire —who commands the ships — or who— touching the lord ’ s shoulder and breathing a soul has measured this motionless forgetful music of women and men thus i behind the eye what sleeps must from the blind borrow this light

“ i ” has not found started finished “ i ’ s ” morning poem the poem “ i ” was writing about “ i ” having sex with the man “ i ” left her husband for the night before or maybe just this morning a sex poem so to speak so to say so as to lay ... a foundation for ... what sex i lost my sex /poem how did it go i know it was called sex something about my bosky acres my unshrubb ’ d down ‘ bout all being tight and yare bring in tiresias did you say soothe tiresias who lies fucking more whoops who likes fucking more “ bring in // the old thought // allen grossman doing yeats that life prepares us for//what never happens ” today the color of my sex was lavender then yellow gold then muted mossy grey and green i bid my lover lower i bid my lover shhhhhhh i bid my lover linger i bid my lover go lover go see i bid my lover stay away “ i ” notices it is almost time to pick up her children from school “ i ” realizes she has gotten nowhere nowhere near it much less inside it wasted another morning can ’ t fucking write a poem to save “ i ’ s ” life oh well “ i ” is at least “ working ” “ i ” pulls on her tight jeans her big boots her puffy parka “ i ” remote starts her car “ i ’ s ” car is a 1995 red toyota 4-runner with racing stripe that doesn ’ t have enough power for “ i ” “ i ’ s ” car stereo also doesn ’ t have enough power for “ i ” “ i ” drives cross town listening to dylan who has plenty of power for “ i ” “ i ” wonders how why dylan isn ’ t “ i ’ s ” man “ i ” gets some looks from some lesser men some in better more powerful trucks even though “ i ’ s ” dirty dirty-blonde hair is covered by a woolen cap “ i ” feels the power of being a single mom in a red truck “ i ” knows it is not enough power “ i ” thinks “ i am the man i suffered i was there ” “ i ” is almost broke but “ i ” thinks “ i live more in a continuous present that i enjoy ” “ i ” thinks “ amor fati ” “ i ” notices the chugach mountains “ i ” notices the chugach mountains sometimes look good and sometimes bad “ i ” remembers that yesterday the chugach mountains looked desolate and dirty and roadblocky “ i ” notices the chugach mountains look particularly beautiful today covered in sun and snow “ i ” almost thinks “ bathed in sun and snow ” but stops herself “ i ” feels that “ i ” can maybe find really start really finish her sex poem tomorrow “ i ” likes the dubus thing about adultery having a morality of its own “ i ” also likes “ human drama ” “ i ” really enjoyed “ i heart huckabees ” “ i ” thought sex was overrated for a long time then not for a year and a half and now again “ i ” gives well has given good head “ i ” takes it like a man “ i ” thinks there should be a new “ new sexualized and radicalized poetry of the self ” “ i ” knows the “ single-minded frenzy of a raving madman ” but “ i ” mostly keeps her head “ i ” remembers that “ as long ago as 1925 boris tomashevsky a leading russian formalist critic observed that the “ autobiographical poem ” is one that mythologizes the poet ’ s life in accordance with the conventions of his time it relates not what has occurred but what should have occurred presenting an idealized image of the poet as representative of his literary school ” “ i ” wants to be a man like marjorie perloff helen hennessy vendler boris tomashevsky “ i ” thinks on the other hand “ i mean i like in art when the artist doesn ’ t know what he knows in general he only knows what he knows specifically ” “ i ” thinks “ that mantel piece is clean enough or my name isn ’ t bob rauschenberg ” “ i ” just wishes “ i ” could talk more smarter theory no “ i ” just wishes “ i ” could write more smarter poems no “ i ” thinks “ why i am a poet and not a ... ” “ i ” thinks “ kalytiak davis paints a picture ” “ i ” wants to include the word “ coruscate ” in it and possibly a quote from rudolf steiner “ i ” wishes she could remember abrams definition of the structure of the greater romantic lyric but that it presents “ a determinate speaker in a particularized and usually localized outdoor setting whom we overhear as he carries on in a fluent vernacular which rises easily to a more formal speech a sustained colloquy sometimes with himself or with the outer scene but more frequently with a silent human auditor present or absent. ” and that “ he speaker begins with a description of the landscape ’ and that “ an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied but integral process of memory thought anticipation and feeling which remains closely involved with the outer scene. ” and that “ in the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight faces up to a tragic loss comes to a moral decision or resolves an emotional problem. ” and that “ often the poem rounds upon itself to end where it began at the outer scene but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation ” evades her “ i ” wants to say “ silent human auditor are you absent or present ” but “ i ” knows “ i ” makes has made that move too often “ i ” knows “ i ” is alone in her red truck “ i ” reconsiders perhaps it is like giving good head “ i ’ thinks his his he himself but not too bitterly then “ i ” thinks “ i ” then “ i ” thinks “ you ” “ i ” has not told her lover that “ i ” is not in love with him any longer but “ i ” knows he knows must know “ i ” has not told her lover that “ i ” had a long conversation with “ i ’ s ” x-husband on the phone last night “ i ” thinks “ my sidestepping and obliquities ” “ i ” thinks love is what went wrong “ i ” feels elizabeth bishop reprimanding “ i ” “ i ” thinks like a gentle loving firm almost slap but really just a squeeze of not on the hand from a the mother neither one of them had for very long long enough “ i ” has not thought of “ i ’ s ” dead mother in a long time ‘ i ” thinks of jonatham letham and his dead mother and his wall of books “ i ” thinks of mark reagan and his walls and walls of books and how his landlord fearing collapse made him move to the bottom floor “ i ” thinks of doug teter and his smaller but still wall of books “ i ” thinks of jude law “ i ” thinks jude law probably doesn ’ t know how to read “ i ” knows that no lover can be her “ objective correlative ” still “ i ” thinks “ so true a lover as theagenes ” “ i ” thinks “ so constant a friend as pylades ” “ i ” thinks “ so valiant a man as orlando ” “ i ” thinks “ so right a prince as xenophon ’ s cyrus ” “ i ” thinks “ so excellent a man in every way as virgil ’ s aeneas ” “ i ” notices dylan is almost done singing “ to ramona ” “ i ” loves “ everything passes everything changes just do what you think you should do. ” “ i ” thinks dylan is singing to “ i ” “ i ” thinks he means now and now and now daily “ i ” is almost there “ i ” wonders if “ i ’ s ” meditation is too long has gotten away from “ i ” “ i ” thinks it should take precisely as long as the ride 15 minutes tops well 30 in a snowstorm “ i ” knows it is not snowing “ i wonders if “ i ” should at this point even refer to “ i ’ s ” meditation “ i ” thinks “ man can embody truth but he can not know it ” “ i ” thinks “ especially under stress of psychological crisis ” “ i ” thinks what ’ s worse anaphora or anaphrodesia “ i ” thinks of the diaphragm still inside her “ i ” shutters at the audacity of her sex “ i ” is exactly on time to pick up her daughter “ i ” must wait another 45 minutes to retrieve her son “ i ” will try and remember to remove it promptly when they get back to “ i ’ s ” house i.e home “ i ” has fucked with the facts so “ you ” think she ’ s robert lowell but whoever saw a girl like robert lowell “ i ” doesn ’ t care if “ you ” silent human auditor present or absent never heard of could give a flying fuck about robert lowell
adrift in the liberating late light of august delicate frivolous they make their way to my front porch and flutter near the glassed-in bulb translucent as a thought suddenly wondered aloud illumining the air that 's thick with honeysuckle and dusk you and i are doing our best at conversation keeping it light steering clear of what we 'd like to say you leave and the night becomes cluttered with moths some tattered their dumbly curious filaments startling against my cheek how quickly instinctively i brush them away dazed they cling to the outer darkness like pale reminders of ourselves others seem to want so desperately to get inside months later i 'll find the woolens snug in their resting places full of missing pieces
up early trying to muffle the sounds of small tasks grinding pouring riffling through yesterday ’ s attacks or market slump then changing my mind—what matter the rush to the waiting room or the ring of some later dubious excuse — having decided to return to bed and finding you curled in the sheet a dream fluttering your eyelids still unfallen still asleep i thought of the old pilgrim when among the fixed stars in paradise he sees adam suddenly the first man there in a flame that hides his body and when it moves to speak what is inside seems not free not happy but huge and weak like an animal in a sack who had captured him what did he want to say i lay down beside you again not knowing if i ’ d stay not knowing where i ’ d been

of ” —no that threadbare old mistake i ’ ll not repeat a lovely woman—do you not think so — is god ’ s best work that she is man ’ s helpmeet the bible says and i will let it go and yet she crowns and makes his life complete who would not shrive himself in her dear face and find his sinless heaven in her embrace 20 young maury loved his slave—she was his own a gift for all he questioned from the skies not other fortune had he ever known like that which sparkled in her wild blue eyes her seal-brown locks and cheeks like roses blown were wealth to him that e ’ en the gods might prize and when her slender waist to him he drew the sum of every earthly bliss he knew 21 they had grown up together —he and she— a world unto themselves all else was bare — a desert to them and an unknown sea their lives were like the birds ’ lives—free and fair and flowed together like a melody they could not live apart ah silly pair but since she was his slave what need to say a swarm of troubles soon beset their way 22 just in the dawn of blushing womanhood her swan-neck glimpsed through shocks of wavy hair a hint of olives in her gentle blood suggesting passion in a rosy lair this shapely venus of the cabins stood in all but birth a princess tall and fair and is it any wonder that this brave and proud young master came to love his slave 28 if it be shame to love a pretty woman then shameful loving is a pretty thing and of all things the most divinely human is this —love purifies life ’ s fountain spring and he who has not quaffed that fount is no man— i ’ d rather be a lover than a king and then preach as we will or may we ’ ll find that cupid dear young god is sometimes blind 55 before the world i hold that none of these the shushan slave the oreb shepherdess nor moab ’ s gleaner ever had the ease of carriage grace of speech the stateliness of step and pose nor had the art to please and charm with symphonies of form and dress nor had such wond ’ rous eyes such lovely mouth as had this blue-eyed daughter lena of the south 56 had priest or prophet ever heard her singing or seen her where the clover was in bloom wading knee-deep while larks were upward springing and winds could scarcely breathe for want of room— thus seen her from the dappled hillsides bringing the cows home in the sunset ’ s golden gloom our good old bible would have had much more of love and romance mixed with sacred lore 57 what man is there who would not dare defend a life like this is doing so a sin or who should blush to be known as her friend white wonder of creation fashioned in the moulds of loveliness kings might contend on martial fields a prize like her to win and yet the cabin ’ s hate and mansion ’ s scorn — she suffered both betwixt them being born 59 when genial spring first hears the mating thrush where waters gossip and the wild flowers throng love rears her altar in the leafy bush and nature chants the sweetest bridal-song when love is free with madness in its rush its very strength defends the heart from wrong love when untutored walks a harmless way with feet though bare that never go astray 153 mind knows no death life is the “ first and last. ” the falling leaf leaves its source living still the flower which withers in the autumn blast dies not but thus escapes the winter ’ s chill and will return through changes strange and vast when summoned forth to range o ’ er vale and hill shall mind which thus perceives life ’ s changes die hath only matter immortality 156 but “ if a man die shall he live again ” this baffling question comes from long ago shall ashes only of life ’ s torch remain the mind cries out and nature answers “ no ” ye who have heard the prophesying rain and seen the flowery resurrection glow ye know of better things than eye hath seen ye know sere earth is mother of the green 157 the wild moose shivers in the north land ’ s breath where huron ’ s wave upbraids the fretful shore the marsh fowl far to southward wandereth and calls her tribes to milder climes explore all nature seems to sigh “ remember death for all the living soon shall be no more. ” but mark how faith sweeps on with tireless wing to find for e ’ en the fowl an endless spring 159 let scoffers mock let unbelief deny— agnosticism stolidly ignore let worldly wisdom proudly ask us “ why ” and still the soul cries out for something more— for something better than philosophy— still longs for higher joys and looks before and can not rest—will ne ’ er contented be till triumph over matter leaves mind free 160 then hail we all the spirits of the just with lena we shall join them all the mind now risen looks down on life ’ s unmeaning dust and soars to higher spheres—all unconfined to spheres of love and duty hope and trust and leaves the sordid and corrupt behind the virgin is the sign of vanquished night her child is born—born of the soul—the light 161 farewell in grandeur sinks the closing day and on our vision slowly fades the light and bygone scenes like shadows fall away to settle in the blank of coming night the octoroon has passed but not for aye to those who have the gift of inner sight the spirit of all nature prophesies a home for love and beauty in the skies
i forgot to tell you it 's almost time to go the sun has distilled its particular worn essence and the glittering trout is flipped on the bow a man asks me what time it is i do n't know i have emptied my purse and wept in the presence of onlookers i forgot to remember to go before eleven when the steely arrow shot swimming to its underneath tense as a stream of salmon in reverse below the laureled relentless clocks the sceptered row of columns dreams one o'clock immense inviolate what time is it i do n't know this story concerns the night i tried to go— though many times i flopped into the silence of orange plastic seating like onto the bow of a lonely ship and felt my breathing slow the frail retreating stand of columns prevents the clocks from telling me time and time again to go at my feet a glittering trout swims past the bow
of many reasons i love you here is one the way you write me from the gate at the airport so i can tell you everything will be alright so you can tell me there is a bird trapped in the terminal all the people ignoring it because they do not know what to do with it except to leave it alone until it scares itself to death it makes you terribly terribly sad you wish you could take the bird outside and set it free or failing that call a bird-understander to come help the bird all you can do is notice the bird and feel for the bird and write to tell me how language feels impossibly useless but you are wrong you are a bird-understander better than i could ever be who make so many noises and call them song these are your own words your way of noticing and saying plainly of not turning away from hurt you have offered them to me i am only giving them back if only i could show you how very useless they are not

quit her job and go to bed the salt-free cottage cheese is cardboard but it ’ s not working nothing is i can wait until she ’ s been resting for an hour before i take it it doesn ’ t help since her

shutting down they ’ ll do another amniocentesis in the morning they ’ ll take the baby in the afternoon she and i are such cases by now that i think they ’ ll lie they ’ ll want to quiet us for the birth by telling us the baby ’ s lungs are ready that stranger things have happened in three days a nurse comes in and says the baby ’ s lungs are ready let ’ s go to prep since linda can ’ t have it naturally it matters all the more to her that she at least be awake she ’ ll get to be both doctors promised me this morning that she ’ ll have a local it ’ s up to them i get scrubbed everyone ’ s in greens down a corridor away from me so i won ’ t hear the anesthesiologist is talking to her doctors who are very intent the scene breaks up her doctors don ’ t have to tell me i know already i want to hit them i say i ’ d promised her because they ’ d promised i ’ d told her she could be awake that i could be there with her stop it you can ’ t let her see you like this her pediatrician says she ’ s partly sedated i tell her i ’ ll be waiting right down the hall from another room than hers a baby a first cry i have to hear it or not listen too for our baby linda ’ s asleep she can ’ t if it ’

sewing her up now she ’ ll be fine. ” there ’ s no reason not to believe her linda ’ s not going to die she ’ s not going to die or have to hate it that she didn ’ t her baby ’ s all right we haven ’ t killed it by not changing doctors it won ’ t have to be breathed for by a machine almost a month early he ’ s a wonder to the staff at five pounds ten he ’ s linda ’ s doing she should be proud of him she ’ ll nurse him and she ’ ll heal i can buy her now the blue- and white-checked gingham mother and baby rabbit i can buy her a robe he comes home with her after the weekend the two of them feel so hallowed to me that i ’ m slow to tell it hasn ’ t worked out for her at all she writes an essay about it his having been taken from her early means she failed bodies are bodies they know things they have their own ways she could have done it if she ’ d gotten the chance her doctor didn ’ t want linda caring how things went that had to be her job not linda ’ s she ’ d gone on to say it almost proudly of linda at the last “ this little girl would be fine if she didn ’ t have a brain. ” it ’ s a long essay i recognize everything but me not her antagonist exactly i ’ d been another thing she ’ d had to worry whenever i ’ d taken her blood pressure she ’ d felt blamed by me if it was high each crisis had been hers to deal with by herself too busy or aloof to find her a better doctor i ’ d taught my classes read worked on my poem ... she ’ s at the mirror i need to get behind it to the aspirin do so close it “ goodness you wake up with a lot of headaches. ” “ sorry. ” “ don ’ t be sorry i ’ m sorry for you. ” surprised that it turned out like that and hating her hating what i ’ d heard in my own voice i get out of her way from the privacy of brooding on it in another room i hear what she meant “ congratulations as good as you are at headaches why settle for so little why not work up a malignancy of some kind ” and i remember that yesterday when we were getting in the car she winced she ’ s always twisting her neck or back or something so i didn ’ t ask her “ did you hurt yourself ” but “ did you hurt yourself again ” ... i move the rest of my clothes out of the house our fights about money pass in having to leave her i also have to think again the most forgettable of our outings over the years we ’ d taken our bodies along in company to certain places in front of me a little to the left she ’ d answered “ yes ” to “ two for dinner ” i wasn ’ t thinking at the time how i fit into what she cared about she fit for me it comes back to me now because i have to change it i ’ d gotten it wrong normal expected there ’ s a brittle politeness between us when i stop by to pick up owen below the hem of her flannel housedress her bare feet

for nolan miller for us too there was a wish to possess something beyond the world we knew beyond ourselves beyond our power to imagine something nevertheless in which we might see ourselves and this desire came always in passing in waning light and in such cold that ice on the valley ’ s lakes cracked and rolled and blowing snow covered what earth we saw and scenes from the past when they surfaced again looked not as they had but ghostly and white among false curves and hidden erasures and never once did we feel we were close until the night wind said “ why do this especially now go back to the place you belong ” and there appeared with its windows glowing small in the distance in the frozen reaches a cabin and we stood before it amazed at its being there and would have gone forward and opened the door and stepped into the glow and warmed ourselves there but that it was ours by not being ours and should remain empty that was the idea
last night the apple trees shook and gave each lettuce a heart six hard red apples broke through the greenhouse glass and landed in the middle of those ever-so-slightly green leaves that seem no mix of seeds and soil but of pastels and light and chalk x ’ s mark our oaks that are supposed to be cut down i ’ ve seen the neighbors frown when they look over the fence and see our espalier pear trees bowing out of shape i did like that they looked like candelabras against the wall but what ’ s the sense in swooning over pruning i said as much to mrs. jones and i swear she threw her cane at me and walked off down the street without it has always puzzled me that people coo over bonsai trees when you can squint your eyes and shrink anything without much of a struggle ensued with some starlings and the strawberry nets so after untangling the two i took the nets off and watched birds with red beaks fly by all morning at the window i reread your letter about how the castles you flew over made crenellated shadows on the water in the rainbarrel has overflowed and made a small swamp i think the potatoes might turn out slightly damp don ’ t worry if there is no fog on the day you come home i will build a bonfire so the smoke will make the cedars look the way you like them to close i ’ m sorry there won ’ t be any salad and i love you
the skyscrapers of new york will never know the coolness that comes down on kifisia but when i see the two cypress trees above your familiar church with the paintings of the damned being tortured in fire and brimstone then i recall the two chimneys behind the cedars i used to like so much when i was abroad all through march rheumatism wracked your lovely loins and in summer you went to aidipsos god what a struggle it is for life to keep going as though it were a swollen river passing through the eye of a needle heavy heat till nightfall the stars discharging midges i myself drinking bitter lemonades and still remaining thirsty moon and movies phantoms and the suffocating pestiferous harbour verina life has ruined us along with the attic skies and the intellectuals clambering up their own heads and the landscapes reduced by drought and hunger to posing like young men selling their souls in order to wear a monocle like young girls — sunflowers swallowing their heads so as to become lilies the days go by slowly my own days circulate among the clocks dragging the second hand in tow remember how we used to twist breathless through the alleys so as not to be gutted by the headlights of cars the idea of the world abroad enveloped us and closed us in like a net and we left with a sharp knife hidden within us and you said ‘ harmodios and aristogeiton ’ verina lower your head so that i can see you though even if i were to see you i ’ d want to look beyond what ’ s a man ’ s value what does he want and how will he justify his existence at the second coming ah to find myself on a derelict ship lost in the pacific ocean alone with the sea and the wind alone and without a wireless or strength to fight the elements kokkinaras 5 august 1928

because this is a monsoon poem expect to find the words jasmine palmyra kuruntokai red mangoes in reference to trees or breasts paddy fields peacocks kurinji flowers flutes lotus buds guarding love ’ s furtive routes expect to hear a lot about erotic consummation inferred by laburnum gyrations and bamboo syncopations listen to the racket of wide-mouthed frogs and bent- legged prawns going about their business of mating while rain falls and falls on tiled roofs and verandas courtyards pagodas because such a big part of you seeks to understand this kind of rain — so unlike your cold rain austere rain get-me-the-hell- out-of-here rain rain that can ’ t fathom how to liberate camphor from the vaults of the earth let me tell you how little is written of mud how it sneaks up like a sleek-gilled vandal to catch hold of your ankles or about the restorative properties of mosquito blood dappled and fried against the wires of a bug-zapping paddle so much of monsoon is to do with being overcome — not from longing as you might think but from the sky ’ s steady bludgeoning until every leaf on every unremembered tree gleams in the abyss of postcoital bliss come now sip on your masala tea put your lips to the sweet spicy skin of it there ’ s more to see — notice the dogs who ’ ve been fucking on the beach locked in embrace like an elongated anubis the crabs scavenging the flesh of a dopey- eyed ponyfish the entire delirious coast with its philtra of beach and saturnine clouds arched backwards in disbelief and the mayflies who swarm in november with all their ephemeral grandeur to die in millions at the behest of light the geckos stationed on living room walls cramming fistfuls of wings in their maws notice how hardly anyone mentions the word death even though the fridge leaks and the sheets have been damp for weeks and in this helter-skelter multitude of gray-greenness notice how even the rain begins to feel fatigued the roads and sewers have nowhere to go and like old-fashioned pursuers they wander and spill their babbling hearts to electrical poles and creatures with ears and what happens later you might ask after we ’ ve moved to a place of shelter when the cracks in the earth have reappeared we dream of wet of course of being submerged in millet stalks of webbed toes and stalled clocks and eels in the mouth of a heron we forget how unforgivably those old poems led us to believe that men were mountains that the beautiful could never remain heartbroken that when the rains arrive we should be delighted to be taken in drowning in devotion
for pos moua what is the name for an antelope who grazes inside a dream then vanishes into the nebula ’ s brush what is the face for refurbishing grammar at each comma ’ s lip whose identity never remembers the shape of beige what is the word for how to conjure the sigh of a line hushed beneath the flap of a thousand shifting plumes what is the body of a garden where a crescent despairs drifts beneath the melt of amber the season is always growing out its hooves one cradlesong of your leaving is not larger than the forest of your arrival to make you a noun forever a loss of you can not be equal to the loss of you
i ’ ve been sad and can ’ t find a seasonal sequence i go forward then my order reverses and it ’ s winter again two years ago with that sticky ice that lost your footing as you gripped that container of greek yogurt you brought to the doctor ’ s even when you couldn ’ t speak you only darted your eyes with a fear that continually registered in your pupil size you clutched your sets of things i am full of what are sets of things i know well then i go backwards and i don ’ t have any sets of things i see your pink-stained washcloth from your wool coat your cerebellum tumor is inside with your other tumors but i don ’ t know it ’ s there yet neither do you it appeared and controlled your brain and the things you couldn ’ t hold i wonder what things really are if they are just a set of symbols we sequence and then find purposeful i wonder if they are like rituals that we learn for our brain we have those for our body and those for our brain i look at you — you are alive — and you breathe labored breaths then you died there in the hospital bed when i let time lapse not knowing how to hold you i let you die for seven days your daughter bigger than i am could hold you she could use her muscles to grip you but i couldn ’ t hold you even though you lost forty pounds your last month i couldn ’ t find the sequence because i reversed everything into its pain cycle and you didn ’ t want me to watch you die but i couldn ’ t understand how everyone could let it happen and i could too but only if i could let it fall into its hole its awkward sequence around death it ’ s not awkward it ’ s just not right i could make as many intuitive decisions and many logical sequences occurred around your treatments but i didn ’ t know you were stepping out of sequence and treatments are not producing remedies and i left myself at the side of the hospital bed you were in another light exiting slowly i thought the sequence of grieving would banish all the anxiety but it came back this year i became debilitated i have a debilitating anxiety that i thought was gone i have too many anxious sequences now and they are blurring meaning they are blurring my truths like time-lapses and i don ’ t rush to find the joy of the occurrence without looking for the traps and my logic and my stumbling out into another bed that places me in this now-future and you don ’ t see me because you are no longer alive with me and i can ’ t rectify this sequence and i worry that when i love him he will die too i can ’ t happen into its learning like it ’ s wisdom it ’ s still deeply unconscious to hold this fear after i banished worry because i looked it in the eyes and it was real and i felt i knew what it looked like it ’ s the unknowing learning that i was deeply afraid to imagine and yet it ’ s your empty bed your empty closet you ’ re empty of the spirited you that gave you to me in that human way we come to rely upon and that shames us so and every night of this thinking is a long night of this thinking do you fall into bed with us and i have no idea of this i ’ d love to think it ’ s so and we have room for your sets of things

if i ever get over the bodies of women i am going to think of the rain of waiting under the eaves of an old house at that moment when it takes a form like fog it makes the mountain vanish then the smell of rain which is the smell of the earth a plow turns up only condensed and refined almost fifty years since thunder rolled and the nerves woke like secret agents under the skin brazil is where i wanted to live the border is not far from here lonely and grateful would be my way to end and something for the pain please a little purity to sand the rough edges a slow downpour from the dark ages a drizzle from the pleistocene as i dream of the rain ’ s long body i will eliminate from mind all the qualities that rain deletes and then i will be primed to study rain ’ s power the first drops lightly hallowing but now and again a great gallop of the horse of rain or an explosion of orange-green light a simple radiance it requires no discipline before i knew women i knew the lonely pleasures of rain the mist and then the clearing i will listen where the lightning thrills the rooster up a willow and my whole life flowing until i have no choice only the rain and i step into it
they flee from me that sometime did me seek with naked foot stalking in my chamber i have seen them gentle tame and meek that now are wild and do not remember that sometime they put themselves in danger to take bread at my hand and now they range busily seeking with a continual change thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise twenty times better but once in special in thin array after a pleasant guise when her loose gown from her shoulders did fall and she me caught in her arms long and small therewith all sweetly did me kiss and softly said ‘ dear heart how like you this ’ it was no dream i lay broad waking but all is turned thorough my gentleness into a strange fashion of forsaking and i have leave to go of her goodness and she also to use newfangleness but since that i so kindly am served i would fain know what she hath deserved
here at the seashore they use the clouds over over again like the rented animals in aïda in the late morning the land breeze turns and now the extras are driving all the white elephants the other way what language are these children shouting in he is lying on the beach listening the sand knocks like glass struck by bare heels he tries to remember snow noise would powder snow ping like that but you don ’ t lie with your ear to powder snow why doesn ’ t the girl who takes care of the children a yale girl without flaw know the difference between lay and lie he tries to remember snow his season the mind is in charge of things then summer is for animals the ocean is erotic all that openness and swaying no matter how often you make love in august you ’ re always aware of genitalia your own and the half-naked others ’ even with the gracefulest bathers you ’ re aware of their kinship with porpoises mammals disporting themselves in a blue element smelling slightly of fish porpoise hazard watches himself awhile like a blue movie in the other hemisphere now people are standing up at work at their easels there they think about love at night when they take off their serious clothes and go to bed sandlessly under blankets today the children his own among them are apparently shouting fluently in portuguese using the colonial dialect of brazil it is just as well they have all been changed into small shrill marginal animals he would not want to understand them again until after labor day he just lays there
except when once we drew identical lots nothing ’ s ever come between us we keep our drifts of space spare and daily shake our down you ’ ve glanced beyond your dirty cuffs and caught me hand-washing my clean shirts stuck with sharp wind both bloods are rare and rarely do we taste the walnut ’ s knot of oil we wake between our fitted sheets and shake our fists or pretend real fright but not in this do we dare touch my rib cage can stand in yours yours become the swinging doors through which magician ’ s swords will slice and miss that knotted muscle it is a trick we ’ ll make an endless show of the outright clanking irregular beating of our acrobatic hearts we ’ ve designed the double bars of depth our hearts skip — the tumbleset we think is absence the somersault we call forbearance — the hearts are there doing turns that teach us to count and keep each finger close to its own sly pulse
you shout my name from beyond my dreams beyond the picture window of this rosarito beach house rushing from bed to shore i glimpse their backs— volcanoes rising out of the sea your back a blue-black silhouette feet wet with the wash of morning waves fountains spring from mammal minds my hands lifting a splash of sand i 'm on my knees toes finding a cool prayer beneath them fingers pressing sea foam to my temples while you open arms wide as a generation raise them to a compass point dive if you could reach them you would ride their fins under the horizon then surf the crash of waves left in their wake and if i could grasp my own fear i 'd drown it leave it breathless and blue as this ocean as the brilliant backs of whales surfacing for air
the room i entered was a dream of this room surely all those feet on the sofa were mine the oval portrait of a dog was me at an early age something shimmers something is hushed up we had macaroni for lunch every day except sunday when a small quail was induced to be served to us why do i tell you these things you are not even here
at the hour the streetlights come on buildings turn abstract the hudson for a moment formal we drink bourbon on the terrace and you speak in the evening voice weighted deep in the throat they plan to harvest oysters you tell me from the harbor by jersey city how the waters will be clean again in twenty years i imagine nets burdened with rough shells the meat dun and sexual below the river and the high rock where boys each year jump from bravado or desperation the day flares turns into itself and innocently sideways the way we always fall into grace or knowledge we watched the police drag the river for a suicide the third this year the terrible hook the boy ’ s frail whiteness his face was blank and new as your face in the morning before the day has worked its pattern of lines and tensions a hook like an iron question and this coming out of the waters a flawed pearl— a memory that wasn ’ t ours to claim perhaps in a bedroom by lamplight a woman waits for this boy she may riffle drawers gathering photographs string keys to abandoned rooms even now she may be leaving closing the door for some silence i need to move next to you water sluiced from the boy ’ s hair i need to watch you light your cigarette the flickering of your face in matchlight as if underwater drifting away i take your cigarette and drag from it touch your hand remember that winter of your long fever the winter we understood how fragile any being together was the wall sweated behind the headboard and you said you felt the rim where dreams crouch and every room of the past it must begin in luxury— do you think—a break and fall into the glamour attending each kind of surrender water must flood the mind as in certain diseases the walls between the cells of memory dissolve blur into a single stream of voices and faces i don ’ t know any more about this river or if it can be cleaned of its tender and broken histories— a tide of voices and this is how the dead rise to us transformed wet and singing the tide of voices pearling in our hands
the feverish room and that white bed the tumbled skirts upon a chair the novel flung half-open where hat hair-pins puffs and paints are spread the mirror that has sucked your face into its secret deep of deeps and there mysteriously keeps forgotten memories of grace and you half dressed and half awake your slant eyes strangely watching me and i who watch you drowsily with eyes that having slept not ache this need one dread nay dare one hope will rise a ghost of memory if ever again my handkerchief is scented with white heliotrope
you left me – sire – two legacies – a legacy of love a heavenly father would suffice had he the offer of – you left me boundaries of pain – capacious as the sea – between eternity and time – your consciousness – and me –

because she broke your heart shannon ’ s a badge— a seven-letter skidmark that scars up across your chest a flare of indelible script between death or glory and mama she rages scales the trellis of your rib cage her red hair swings down to bracket your ankles whip up the braid of your backbone cuff your wrists she keeps you sleepless with her afterimage and each pinned and martyred limb aches for more her memory wraps you like a vise how simple the pain that trails and graces the length of your body how it fans blazes writes itself over in the blood ’ s tightening sighs bruises into wisdom you have no name for
i know the origin of rocks settling out of water hatching crystals from fire put under pressure in various designs i gathered pretty picnic after picnic and i know about love a little igneous lust the slow affections of the sedimentary the pressure on earth out of sight to rise up into material something solid you can hold a whole mountain for example or a loose collection of pebbles you forgot you were keeping

it lies in our hands in crystals too intricate to decipher it goes into the skillet without being given a second thought it spills on the floor so fine we step all over it we carry a pinch behind each eyeball it breaks out on our foreheads we store it inside our bodies in secret wineskins at supper we pass it around the table talking of holidays and the sea
a senryu sequence when i come late to bed i move your leg flung over my side— that warm gate nights you ’ re not here i inch toward the middle of this boat balancing when i turn over in sleep you turn i turn you turn i turn you some nights you tug the edge of my pillow under your cheek look in my dream pulling the white sheet over your bare shoulder i marry you again
simmers on the kitchen stove all afternoon dense kernels surrender to the fertile juices their tender bellies swelling with delight in the yard we plant rhubarb cauliflower and artichokes cupping wet earth over tubers our labor the germ of later sustenance and renewal across the field the sound of a baby crying as we carry in the last carrots whorls of butter lettuce a basket of red potatoes i want to remember us this way— late september sun streaming through the window bread loaves and golden bunches of grapes on the table spoonfuls of hot soup rising to our lips filling us with what endures
you follow close behind me for a thousand miles responsive to my movements i signal you signal back we will meet at the next exit you blow kisses which i return you mouth `` i love you '' a message for my rearview mirror we do a slow tango as we change lanes in tandem gracefully as though music were guiding us it is tighter than bodies locked in heat this caring this ardent watching

the sleep of this night deepens because i have walked coatless from the house carrying the white envelope all night it will say one name in its little tin house by the roadside i have raised the metal flag so its shadow under the roadlamp leaves an imprint on the rain-heavy bushes now i will walk back thinking of the few lights still on in the town a mile away in the yellowed light of a kitchen the millworker has finished his coffee his wife has laid out the white slices of bread on the counter now while the bed they have left is still warm i will think of you you who are so far away you have caused me to look up at the stars tonight they have not moved from childhood those games played after dark again i walk into the wet grass toward the starry voices again i am the found one intimate returned by all i touch on the way
parc georges-brassens paris most afternoons i ’ d run laps through parc brassens where grows the second smallest vineyard i have ever seen and where those silver pruned-back stalks looked blunt strung-out on wires and mostly dead all winter that was how i saw them that ’ s all i expected even in the cold i ’ d see a guy my age there once a week playing his guitar he ’ d sit next to the bench where i ’ d be stretching he rarely spoke— just to ask if i ’ d like a song— until the week before i left for good i was sitting at the top of a hill about a hundred feet away from where if you stand tiptoe you can see the eiffel tower he sat too close to me we spoke of many things then he suggested we go at it right there on the ground under the sun this is how one lives who knows that she will die rolling in the arms of anyone when she can— rolling in the arms of a musician—aware that no one cares much what we do in little knolls behind reedy forsythia in the middle of a tuesday in the middle of living and i would know now how he felt and the ground against me and whether he was rough or sweet and what is possible would widen every hour oh but me i thought i was immortal
who is that creature and who does he want me i trust i do not attempt to call out his name for fear he will tread on me what do you believe he asks that we all want to be alone i reply except when we do not that the world was open to my sorrow and ate most of it that today is a gift and i am ready to receive you
i was the lonely one in whom they swarmed in the millions i was their creature and i was grateful i could sleep when i wanted i lived a divided existence in sleepdreams that lit up a silence as dreadful as that of the moon i have an overly-precise recall of those solitary years before i opened the curtain and drew upon a universe of want that made me so strong i could crack spines of books with one hand
not embittered even while freezing to the ice of their own lakes the night i was leaving for madrid into the noisy party a dazzling friend-of-a-friend walked in i want so much as a couple of kids on the dance floor want to slow the tempo hold there longer to feel that seedly longing to be pressed into the soil or that little lift the mothers get when stocking larders even now vestige of the primitive urge to be provided for and to provide i went alone to see that balcony in verona after the roman dramas and luxuries above the spanish steps when an elegant footman brought a pack of reds on a silver tray and all but smoked them for you after your towels had warmed in london ’ s best hotel whose name i can ’ t remember and am kind of glad glad now for the rest of empty august and the convent hostel ’ s eleven o ’ clock curfew glad now when i go to the distinguished dinners that i have stood alone wondering at illuminated books looking at woolf ’ s spectacles under glass or standing under bourgeois ’ s giant spider at the tate—at times the best kept universe was my own no interceding docents or guided tours but a riverine serendipitous wandering—waif naïf i liked the light enormously so why did i obey the bell that called me in
it needn ’ t be tinder this juncture of the year a cigarette second guessed from car to brush the woods ’ parchment is given to cracking asunder the first puff of wind yesterday a big sycamore came across first and hawthorne and is there yet the papers say it has to happen if just as dribs and drabs on the asbestos siding but tonight is buckets of stars as hard and dry as dimes a month ’ s supper things stacks in the sink tea brews from water stoppered in the bath and any thirst carried forward is quenched thinking you piece by piece an xmas gift hidden and found weeks after the ribbon the box i have reservoirs of want enough to freeze many nights over
as he spoke we could hear ever more loudly the noise of the burning fires the flood of flames was coming nearer and nearer “ my father let me take you upon my shoulders and carry you with me the burden will be easy whatever happens you and i will experience it together peril or safety whichever it will be little iülus will come along beside me my wife will follow behind us and you my servants listen to what i say just as you leave the limits of the city there is a mound and the vestiges of a deserted temple of ceres and a cypress tree that has been preserved alive for many years by the piety of our fathers we will all meet there though perhaps by different ways and father you must carry in your arms the holy images of our household gods i coming so late from the fighting and the carnage can not presume to touch them until i have washed myself in running water. ” thus i spoke i take up the tawny pelt of a lion and cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it and bowing down i accept the weight of my father iülus puts his hand in mine and goes along beside me trying to match my steps as best he can trying his best to keep up my wife follows behind us a little way back so we all set out together making our way among the shadows and i who only just a little while ago had faced undaunted showers of arrows and swarms of enemy greeks am frightened by every slightest change in the air and startled by every slightest sound i hear fearful for whom i walk with and whom i carry and just as i had almost come to the gates and thought that i had almost gotten us free i thought i heard the sound of many feet and my father peering intently into the shadows cries out to me “ get away get away my son my son they are coming i see their shining shields i see the glow of their weapons in the dark ” i am alarmed and i don ’ t know what happened but some power hostile to me distracts my wits and i am confused and i lead us away by ways that i don ’ t know and off the familiar streets that together we are following and so o god some fate has taken away my wife creüsa my wife away from me what happened did she wander from the way that we were going did she fall back having to rest some place back there and so we left her i did not know i never saw her again and as we went i never turned to look behind and never thought of her until we reached the mound and ceres ’ ancient place when all of us at last had gotten there we all were there but she had vanished and she wasn ’ t there gone from her people gone from her child and her husband what men or gods in my frenzy did i not cry out against what worse sight had i seen i left ascanius and anchises and the household gods in the care of my companions and i found a secluded place deep in a valley for them to hide and i myself took up my shining weapons and sought the city again determined no matter what to look for my creüsa everywhere in troy i find my way along the walls and to and through the shadowed gate i ’ d left the city by carefully step by unseen step in the dark backwards the way i came i make my way everywhere as i go fills me with terror the very silence around me fills me with terror i make my way to my home in case in case she ’ s gone back there the greeks had invaded the house and set it on fire and through the house the fire rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof and the flames tower high above the burning house and the heat of the burning pours up into the sky and so i go on and once again i see the palace of priam and the citadel and in the empty courtyard of juno ’ s shrine there ’ s phoenix and dire ulysses guarding the treasures taken from everywhere from the shrines that the greeks had set fire to the golden bowls the holy altar-tables the stolen holy vestments boys and trembling matrons stand around i wander in the streets in my desperation calling out her name creüsa creüsa calling creüsa over and over again and as i went among the ruined buildings and through the streets of the ruined city lo suddenly there rose before my eyes the strangely magnified image of my wife i was stupefied my hair stood on end my voice got caught in my throat then she spoke to me and said words that altered everything for me “ beloved husband what use is it for you to persist in this insanity of grief what has happened here has happened not without the will of the gods the high lord of olympus does not permit creüsa to go with you to be with you on your journey where you are going long exile will be yours ploughing across vast seas until you come to hesperia where lydian tiber gently flows between rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy a king and wedded to a royal wife give up your weeping now for your creüsa i a dardan woman and the spouse of divine venus ’ s son will never see the scornful households of the myrmidons or the dolopians and never have to be a scullion slave in service to some greek matron the mighty mother keeps me on these shores farewell and may your care protect and cherish your child and mine. ” and having spoken thus the image of her receded into air leaving me weeping with so much still to say three times i tried to embrace her and to hold her three times the image clasped in vain escaped as if it were a breeze or on the wings of a vanishing dream and so the night being over i returned to my companions where they were when i got there i was amazed to see how many others women and men had come wretched survivors of the fall of the city to join us in the exile and the journey a heartbreaking company come from everywhere ready in their hearts and with their fortunes to follow me wherever i was going and now the morning star was rising over the highest ridges of ida bringing in the day that was beginning the danaans held the city behind the gates that they had locked there was no hope of further help and so i acknowledged this and taking up the burden of my father once again i sought the hills
i tell her i love her like not killing or ten minutes of sleep beneath the low rooftop wall on which my rifle rests i tell her in a letter that will stink when she opens it of bolt oil and burned powder and the things it says i tell her how pvt bartle says offhand that war is just us making little pieces of metal pass through each other
a recipe for lamb tagine demands a mysterious ingredient raz el hanout animal vegetable compound of kings like myrrh i decide not to look it up to wait and see at first it is everything we seek but can ’ t express then it reverses everything thrust upon us—think fast — by the universe like the leg my friend tom caught when a cyclist got clipped by a car the driver stinking drunk at 9:00 am severed above the knee the leg flung itself into the air a javelin tom always quick reached up and caught it but the story has a twist after the cyclist died in an ambulance the widow inexplicably came on to tom not that tom is unattractive indeed he is the sort of man i ’ d throw myself at if i were a leg it ’ s hard to imagine the sex that tom and this woman would have had there in the hotel room with the blackout curtains pulled i ’ ve never had sex with tom myself but if i had been that leg or that woman i might have whispered “ what fine reflexes you have sir ” “ sir say something tender ” “ cradle me against the guttural gasp from your solar plexus. ” “ oh sir i sense the tip of bone on skin a surge of déjà vu. ” “ i am coming i am about to come your shuddering lover your raz el hanout ”
i used an arrow to kill the spider i used a steamroller to flatten the worm for the ants i called in an air strike bee that found its way in through the screen blowtorch the mammals were easier— a bucket of water for submerging the cat a poisoned word thrown to the dog for love only a kitchen match that and a stove leaking gas and waiting until the dinner was good and burned
fly from me does all i would have stay the blossoms did not stay stayed not the frost in the yellow grass every leash snapped every contract void and flying in the crows lingers but a moment in the graveyard oaks yet inside me it never stops so i can ’ t tell who is chasing who chased i can sleep into afternoon and still wake soaring so out come the bats down spiral swifts into the chimneys hey i ’ m real say the dream- figments then are gone like breath-prints on a window handwriting in snow whatever i hold however flies apart the children skip into the park come out middle-aged with children of their own your laugh over the phone will it ever answer me again too much flying photons perforating us voices hurtling into outer space whitman out past neptune dickinson retreating yet getting brighter remember running barefoot across hot sand into the sea ’ s hovering remember my hand as we darted against the holiday broadway throng catching your train just as it was leaving hey it ’ s real your face like a comet horses coming from the field for morning oats insects hitting a screen the message nearly impossible to read obscured by light because carried by mercury i love you i ’ m coming sure what fluttered is now gone maybe a smudge left maybe a delicate under- feather only then that too yes rained away and when the flying is flown and the heart ’ s a useless sliver in a glacier and the gown hangs still as meat in a locker and eyesight is dashed-down glass and the mouth rust- stoppered will some twinge still pass between us still some fledgling pledge
love is the kindest expression of absence— or else is a day by the river in which by motion it becomes clear— there have been in an hour an infinite train of rivers which did you want to see one comes slowly to realize there is no evading things the heart will have its way though its will go unfulfilled there is no shame in this the pleasures in this world— soft breeze soft thighs a bit of music words that make a good sound— suggest when taken whole that the thing the body longs for is not never has been some petite mort a true thing known to grass the elderly man with a kind word in greeting and the woman saying that she is about to come as in going to arrive— at last to fill the body held so long by stewards in her name
it 's often those who talk a streak on world affairs and love and peace who seem to love and peace the least

the message i found on the post-it note went thus love truth expect to be found out kid-style capitals proved i wrote it but left no clue why i 'd swelled into a fat clause no editor could edit then an entry on a shrink 's list of patient slang for sex— her desk norwegian teak the mug of tea on which she had affixed her post-it notes hot against her knuckle their lips of stickum loosening and yet i knew the note to peel away at hour 's end would terminate our sessions—cool as the draft her linen skirt was lifting to love just stay benighted given everything i know you 've got to hide
years later the water still drips— there 's no one to tighten the valve it courses through old pipes down to the septic tank next morning in the cellar i start the motor with a stick it shakes and rumbles and chirps— the switch is broken is all at night the water arrives illegally undergroundly to the very grave where last spring parsley sprouted and at the foot beside it feral sorrel darkens tastily and tartly like clandestine sex the motor lifts the spirits and returns the night 's deductions it 's morning i hum softly— a stranger will replace me in the cellar a stream of light rinses the window grate it pulses strikes the meter— i catch my rhythm on the stairs and for memory 's sake i hum— as i pass the septic tank— a fluid underground song about sorrel and a stranger

i wait for my shadow to forget me to take that one phantom step that i keep from taking i wait for the simple flash of a dancer 's spat upon this one moon of stage-light the mind 's lonely oval illuminated on the surface of some windless pond or slew and the old soft-shoe practices to get it right husha-husha-hush in its constant audition of sawdust even this choreography of useless wishing is not enough to keep tonight from becoming nothing more than some floor's forgotten routine where faded numbered dance-steps silently waltz themselves away the orchestra 's now ready to fauré into the evening 's last song while i try to convince myself to cross this room for the first time all night and rinse what 's left in some débutante 's silver sequined waterfall hope keeling hopelessly ever closer to the edge across the floor other couples sashay on a tin flask empties itself from asking the shadow 's last chance now wasted in some chandelier 's dim lust
talking we begin to find the way into our hearts we who knew no words words being a rare commodity in those countries we left behind both refugees and similarly deprived we marvel at the many things there are to say so many variations and colors of the same thought so many different lengths in the words that line up together on our tongues no scarcity no rationing no waiting in line in order to buy the same answer we heard each time we asked that one word owned by the state manufactured by the state serving all purposes equally alike no no no and sometimes never
naked for twenty-four of our last thirty-six hours together and i mean museum-quality sex- shop god-riddling naked sapping gold light from the windows of her hundred-year-old baltimore dorm we were hungry for selling points like a couple in a showroom compelling arguments were made to close the deal and children were discussed i kissed her from heel to head in a shower without water then with nude she read me a letter as a waiter would his specials and i could n't keep my eyes off smooth shoulders belly pelvis deep olive skin all a balm against sleep it was from her sexy grandmother in dieppe and séverine translated both of us somehow drawn to this third party in a tidal sort of way her lunar candor her antipodal ease with words and the world we were difficult séverine and i a beautiful strain a cult of two even eating we made lots of noise even resting in bed watching the trees our lighter breathing our limb-shifting sheet- rustling even our dreaming had fight her heart was exceptionally loud—not with love but with knowing knowing what to be afraid of
four lanes over a plump helium heart— slipped maybe from some kid 's wrist or a rushed lover 's empty front seat through a half-cracked car window— rises like a shiny purple cloudlet toward today 's gray mess of clouds trailing its gold ribbon like lightning that will never strike anything or anyone here on the forsaken ground its bold love increasingly illegible as it ascends over the frozen oaks riding swift currents toward the horizon a swollen word wobbling out of sight
to say no more of art than that it makes by its very distraction a mode of abiding accordingly its variations each type of thread-and-piecework named double engagement ring log cabin or broken dishes all built on the same geometric figures— precise interception of angle and line so too each tale of love is rooted in that first tale the poet descending to the underworld finally granted his shade who 'll follow him only to disappear again perhaps one version has them reunite affixed in their solo chromospheres the stars which to the human eye appear to overlap substanceless love immune at last to gravity and time— in texas i might as well recount this as a story there 's a town with a courthouse built on concrete and twisted iron edified in red granite capitals architrave of red sandstone with point and punch a carver broached the effigy of his muse he rendered her attractive features down to the very blush of course she spurned him of course there was another to whom she turned love should not be written in stone but written in water i paraphrase the latin of catullus the sculptor carried on not just the face of his beloved but the face of her other lover snaggle-toothed wart-peppered pudgy them both made into ugly caricatures of themselves as wanton as the carver perceived them and as lewd well craze and degenerate and crack the portraits hold though long since the participants have dwindled into dirt beautiful unbeautiful each with an aspect of exactness tread light upon this pedestal dream instead of a time before your love disfigured a time withstanding even crass wind-beaten time itself
the dog came back grinning and smelling of carrion and her husband behind it stride and gestures too large for the house his field voice cracking declared a wider kingdom and the name of a fallen city not theirs this time from outside the roar and shrill of celebration poured in he drew near in a rank cloud breathing hard to show her the gash in his thumb so she washed in five waters and went to their bed but he slept without moving still in his cloak and dust
well this is nothing new nothing to rattle the rafters in the noggin this moment of remembering and its kissing cousin the waking dream i wonder if i 'll remember it i 've had a vision of a woman reclining underneath a tree she 's about half naked and little by little i 'm sprinkling her burial mounds with grass this is the kind of work i like it lets me remember and so i do i remember the time i laid my homemade banjo in the fire and let it burn there was nothing else to burn and the house was cold the cigar box curled inside the flames but the burst of heat was over soon and once the little roar was done i could hear the raindrops plopping up the buckets and kettles scattered out like little ponds around the room it was night and i was a boy alone and left to listen to that old music i liked it i 've liked it ever since i loved the helpless people i loved that 's what a little boy will do but a grown man will turn it all to sadness and let it soak his heart until he wrings it out and dreams about another kind of love some afternoon beneath a tree burial mounds—that 's hilarious
for rlb pass by the showy rose blabbing open suckling a shiny beetle pass by the changeless diamond that falls asleep in shadow— this love is a lichen alga and fungus made one fleck feeding on what it feeds growing slightly faster than stone into a patch of gray lace a double thumbprint its bloom distinguishable with practice from its dormant phase crocheting its singular habit over time a faithful stain bound to its home etching on the unmoved rock the only rune it knows
if the nose of the pig in the market of firenze has lost its matte patina and shines brassy even in the half light if the mosaic saint on the tiles of the basilica floor is half gone worn by the gravity of solid soles the passing of piety if the arms of venus have reentered the rubble taken by time her perennial lover mutilating even the memory of beauty and if the mother hiding with her child from the death squads of brutality if she trying to keep the child quiet to keep them from being found out holds her hand over his mouth holds him against her tighter and tighter until he stops breathing if the restorer—trying to bring back to perfection the masterpiece scarred by its transit through time wipes away by mistake the mysterious smile if what loves and love is takes away what it aims to preserve then here is the place to fall silent meaning well but in danger of marring what we would praise unable to do more than wear down the marble steps to the altar smother the fire we would keep from the wind ’ s extinction or if afraid of our fear we lift the lid from the embers and send abroad into the parched night a flight of sparks incendiary dying to catch somewhere hungry for fuel the past its dry provision tinder for brilliance and heat prelude to cold and to ash
he— you saw the way her body looked at me all address calling me down she was so well-turned curve and volume her body presented itself— clay— i could mold it she— you were taboo not totem— covered her though your wing gave no shelter your pale plumage became shadow your beak caught in the net of her hair he— when i entered her her death became my life in her death swoon she fell away from me the more she fell the deeper i pursued her the deeper i went the more lost she became her body became a forest of echoes hills and valleys echoing each other a language i did n't know— surrounded alone she— the discarded body lies in long grass flies and wasps fumble there— on a summer day the lost girl hums— kelly sarah joanne changed into parable prodigal hair flung out body agape like a question the scavenger crow knows— she 's beautiful outgrowing her name in the noon heat

we sat together at one summer ’ s end that beautiful mild woman your close friend and you and i and talked of poetry i said ‘ a line will take us hours maybe yet if it does not seem a moment ’ s thought our stitching and unstitching has been naught better go down upon your marrow-bones and scrub a kitchen pavement or break stones like an old pauper in all kinds of weather for to articulate sweet sounds together is to work harder than all these and yet be thought an idler by the noisy set of bankers schoolmasters and clergymen the martyrs call the world. ’ and thereupon that beautiful mild woman for whose sake there ’ s many a one shall find out all heartache on finding that her voice is sweet and low replied ‘ to be born woman is to know— although they do not talk of it at school— that we must labour to be beautiful. ’ i said ‘ it ’ s certain there is no fine thing since adam ’ s fall but needs much labouring there have been lovers who thought love should be so much compounded of high courtesy that they would sigh and quote with learned looks precedents out of beautiful old books yet now it seems an idle trade enough. ’ we sat grown quiet at the name of love we saw the last embers of daylight die and in the trembling blue-green of the sky a moon worn as if it had been a shell washed by time ’ s waters as they rose and fell about the stars and broke in days and years i had a thought for no one ’ s but your ears that you were beautiful and that i strove to love you in the old high way of love that it had all seemed happy and yet we ’ d grown as weary-hearted as that hollow moon

the curtains were half drawn the floor was swept and strewn with rushes rosemary and may lay thick upon the bed on which i lay where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept he leaned above me thinking that i slept and could not hear him but i heard him say ‘ poor child poor child ’ and as he turned away came a deep silence and i knew he wept he did not touch the shroud or raise the fold that hid my face or take my hand in his or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head he did not love me living but once dead he pitied me and very sweet it is to know he still is warm though i am cold

alas have i not pain enough my friend upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire than did on him who first stale down the fire while love on me doth all his quiver spend but with your rhubarb words you must contend to grieve me worse in saying that desire doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire of sinful thoughts which do in ruin end if that be sin which doth the manners frame well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed ready of wit and fearing naught but shame if that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed a loathing of all loose unchastity then love is sin and let me sinful be

the wisest scholar of the wight most wise by phoebus ’ doom with sugared sentence says that virtue if it once met with our eyes strange flames of love it in our souls would raise but for that man with pain this truth descries while he each thing in sense ’ s balance weighs and so nor will nor can behold those skies which inward sun to heroic mind displays virtue of late with virtuous care to stir love of herself takes stella ’ s shape that she to mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her it is most true for since i her did see virtue ’ s great beauty in that face i prove and find th ’ effect for i do burn in love

it is most true that eyes are formed to serve the inward light and that the heavenly part ought to be king from whose rules who do swerve rebels to nature strive for their own smart it is most true what we call cupid ’ s dart an image is which for ourselves we carve and fools adore in temple of our heart till that good god make church and churchman starve true that true beauty virtue is indeed whereof this beauty can be but a shade which elements with mortal mixture breed true that on earth we are but pilgrims made and should in soul up to our country move true and yet true that i must stella love
a strife is grown between virtue and love while each pretends that stella must be his her eyes her lips her all saith love do this since they do wear his badge most firmly prove but virtue thus that title doth disprove that stella o dear name that stella is that virtuous soul sure heir of heav ’ nly bliss not this fair outside which our hearts doth move and therefore though her beauty and her grace be love ’ s indeed in stella ’ s self he may by no pretense claim any manner place well love since this demur our suit doth stay let virtue have that stella 's self yet thus let virtue but that body grant to us

away above a harborful of caulkless houses among the charley noble chimneypots of a rooftop rigged with clotheslines a woman pastes up sails upon the wind hanging out her morning sheets with wooden pins o lovely mammal her nearly naked breasts throw taut shadows when she stretches up to hang at last the last of her so white washed sins but it is wetly amorous and winds itself about her clinging to her skin so caught with arms upraised she tosses back her head in voiceless laughter and in choiceless gesture then shakes out gold hair while in the reachless seascape spaces between the blown white shrouds stand out the bright steamers to kingdom come
when she came into his room he was asleep and when she touched him he woke— her hand on his shoulder her knee at his mouth and in the darkness she looked like a boy when he tried to sit up she covered his ears with her hands “ save ourselves from ourselves ” she said and then a wind stirred in the room as if she ’ d placed those words in his mouth
the argument a vulgar error having long prevailed among many persons who imagine sally salisbury the subject of this ballad the author begs leave to undeceive and assure them it has not the least allusion to her he being a stranger to her very name at the time this song was composed for as innocence and virtue were ever the boundaries of his muse so in this little poem he had no other view than to set forth the beauty of a chaste and disinterested passion even in the lowest class of human life the real occasion was this a shoemaker ’ s ’ prentice making holiday with his sweet-heart treated her with a sight of bedlam the puppet-shews the flying-chairs and all the elegancies of the moorfields from whence proceeding to the farthing pye-house he gave her a collation of buns cheesecakes gammon of bacon stuff ’ d-beef and bottled-ale through all which scenes the author dodged them charm ’ d with the simplicity of their courtship from whence he drew this little sketch of nature but being then young and obscure he was very much ridicul ’ d by some of his acquaintance for this performance which nevertheless made its way into the polite world and amply recompenced him by the applause of the divine addison who was pleased more than once to mention it with approbation of all the girls that are so smart there ’ s none like pretty sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley there is no lady in the land is half so sweet as sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley her father he makes cabbage-nets and through the streets does cry ’ em her mother she sells laces long to such as please to buy ’ em but sure such folks could ne ’ er beget so sweet a girl as sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley when she is by i leave my work i love her so sincerely my master comes like any turk and bangs me most severely but let him bang his belly full i ’ ll bear it all for sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley of all the days that ’ s in the week i dearly love but one day and that ’ s the day that comes betwixt a saturday and monday for then i ’ m drest all in my best to walk abroad with sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley my master carries me to church and often am i blamed because i leave him in the lurch as soon as text is named i leave the church in sermon time and slink away to sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley when christmas comes about again o then i shall have money i ’ ll hoard it up and box and all i ’ ll give it to my honey and would it were ten thousand pounds i ’ d give it all to sally she is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley my master and the neighbours all make game of me and sally and but for her i ’ d better be a slave and row a galley but when my seven long years are out o then i ’ ll marry sally o then we ’ ll wed and then we ’ ll bed but not in our alley

a month or twain to live on honeycomb is pleasant but one tires of scented time cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme and that strong purple under juice and foam where the wine ’ s heart has burst nor feel the latter kisses like the first once yet this poor one time i will not pray even to change the bitterness of it the bitter taste ensuing on the sweet to make your tears fall where your soft hair lay all blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise over my face and eyes and yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat makes of its foolish poppies ’ mouths of red these were not sown these are not harvested they grow a month and are cast under feet and none has care thereof as none has care of divided love i know each shadow of your lips by rote each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows the fashion of fair temples tremulous with tender blood and colour of your throat i know not how love is gone out of this seeing that all was his love ’ s likeness there endures upon all these but out of these one shall not gather love day hath not strength nor the night shade enough to make love whole and fill his lips with ease as some bee-builded cell feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell i know not how this last month leaves your hair less full of purple colour and hid spice and that luxurious trouble of closed eyes is mixed with meaner shadows and waste care and love kissed out by pleasure seems not yet worth patience to regret

it snakes behind me this invisible chain gang— the aliases your many faces peopling that vast hotel the past what did we learn every twenty minutes the elevated train the world shuddering beyond the pane it was never warm enough in winter the walls peeled the color of corsages ruined in the air sweeping the floor my black wig on the chair i never meant to leave you in that hotel where the voices of patrons long gone seemed to echo in the halls a scent of spoiled orchids but this was never an elegant hotel the iron fretwork of the el held each room in a deep corrosive bloom this was the bankrupt ’ s last chance the place the gambler waits to learn his black mare ’ s leg snapped as she hurtled towards the finish line how did we live your face over my shoulder was the shade of mahogany in the speckled mirror bolted to the wall it was never warm you arrived through a forest of needles the white mist of morphine names for sleep that never came my black wig unfurled across the battered chair your arms circled me when i stood by the window downstairs the clerk who read our palms broke the seal on another deck of cards she said you ’ re my fate my sweet annihilating angel every naked hotel room i ’ ve ever checked out of there ’ s nothing left of that but even now when night pulls up like a limousine sea-blue and i ’ m climbing the stairs keys in hand i ’ ll reach the landing and you ’ re there—the one lesson i never get right trains hurtled by extinguished somewhere past the bend of midnight the shuddering world your arms around my waist i never meant to leave of all that there 's nothing left but a grid of shadows the el tracks throw over the street the empty lot gone the blistered sills voices that rilled across each wall gone the naked bulb swinging from the ceiling that chicanery of light that made your face a brief eclipse over mine how did we live the mare broke down i was your fate that yellow train the plot of sleet through dust crusted on the pane it was n't warm enough what did we learn all i have left of you is this burnt place on my arm so i won't forget you even when i 'm nothing but small change in the desk clerk 's palm nothing but the pawn ticket crumpled in your pocket the one you 'll never redeem whatever i meant to say loses itself in the bend of winter towards extinction this passion of shadows falling like black orchids through the air i never meant to leave you there by the pane that terminal hotel the world shuddering with trains
up there on the mountain road the fireworks blistered and subsided for once at eye level spatter of light like water flicked from the fingers the brief emergent pattern and after the afterimage bled from the night sky a delayed and muffled thud that must have seemed enormous down below the sound concomitant with the arranged threat of fire above the bleachers i stood as tall and straight as possible trying to compensate trying not to lean in my friend ’ s direction beside me correcting height he slouched his shoulders knees locked one leg stuck out to form a defensive angle with the other thus we were most approximate and most removed in the long pauses between explosions he ’ d signal conversation by nodding vaguely toward the ragged pines i said my children would have loved the show he said we were watching youth at a great distance and i thought how the young are truly boring unvaried as they are by the deep scar of doubt the constant afterimage of regret—no major tension in their bodies no tender hesitation they don ’ t yet know that this is so much work scraping from the self its multiple desires don ’ t yet know fatigue with self the hunger for obliteration that wakes us in the night at the dead hour and fuels good sex of course i didn ’ t say it i realized he watched the fireworks with the cool attention he had turned on women dancing in the bar a blunt uninvested gaze calibrating every moving part thighs breasts the muscles of abandon i had wanted that gaze on me and as the evening dwindled to its nub its puddle of tallow appetite without object as the men peeled off to seek the least encumbered consolation and the women grew expansive with regard— how have i managed so long to stand among the paired bodies the raw pulsing music driving loneliness into the air like scent and not be seized by longing not give anything to be summoned into the larger soul two souls can make watching the fireworks with my friend so little ease between us i see that i have armed myself fire changes everything it touches perhaps he has foreseen this impediment perhaps when he holds himself within himself a sheathed angular figure at my shoulder he means to be protective less of him than me keeping his complicating rage inside his body and what would it solve if he took one hand from his pocket risking touch risking invitation— if he took my hand it would not alter this explicit sadness the evening stalls the fireworks grow boring at this remove the traffic prowling the highway at our backs the couples the families scuffling on the bank must think us strangers to each other or more likely with the celebrated fireworks thrusting their brilliant repeating designs above the ridge we simply blur into the foreground like the fireflies dragging among the trees their separate discontinuous lanterns

i stood on the bridge at midnight as the clocks were striking the hour and the moon rose o'er the city behind the dark church-tower i saw her bright reflection in the waters under me like a golden goblet falling and sinking into the sea and far in the hazy distance of that lovely night in june the blaze of the flaming furnace gleamed redder than the moon among the long black rafters the wavering shadows lay and the current that came from the ocean seemed to lift and bear them away as sweeping and eddying through them rose the belated tide and streaming into the moonlight the seaweed floated wide and like those waters rushing among the wooden piers a flood of thoughts came o ’ er me that filled my eyes with tears how often o how often in the days that had gone by i had stood on that bridge at midnight and gazed on that wave and sky how often o how often i had wished that the ebbing tide would bear me away on its bosom o ’ er the ocean wild and wide for my heart was hot and restless and my life was full of care and the burden laid upon me seemed greater than i could bear but now it has fallen from me it is buried in the sea and only the sorrow of others throws its shadow over me yet whenever i cross the river on its bridge with wooden piers like the odor of brine from the ocean comes the thought of other years and i think how many thousands of care-encumbered men each bearing his burden of sorrow have crossed the bridge since then i see the long procession still passing to and fro the young heart hot and restless and the old subdued and slow and forever and forever as long as the river flows as long as the heart has passions as long as life has woes the moon and its broken reflection and its shadows shall appear as the symbol of love in heaven and its wavering image here

there was a graven image of desire painted with red blood on a ground of gold passing between the young men and the old and by him pain whose body shone like fire and pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire of his left wrist with fingers clenched and cold the insatiable satiety kept hold walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire the senses and the sorrows and the sins and the strange loves that suck the breasts of hate till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins death stood aloof behind a gaping grate upon whose lock was written peradventure

i know him that man walking- toward me up the crowded street of the city i have lived with him seven years now i know his fast stride his windy wheatfield hair his hands thrust deep in his jacket pockets hands that have known my body touched its softest part caused its quick shudders and slow releasings i have seen his face above my face his mouth smiling moaning his eyes closed and opened i have studied his eyes the brown turning gold at the centers i have silently watched him lying beside me in the early morning i know his loneliness like mine human and sad but different too his private pain and pleasure i can never enter even as he comes closer past trees and cars trash and flowers steam rising from the manhole covers gutters running with rain he lifts his head he sees me we are strangers again and a rending music of desire and loss— i don ’ t know him—courses through me and we kiss and say it ’ s good to see you as if we haven ’ t seen each other in years when it was just a few hours ago and we are shy then not knowing what to say next
we fix you maternally in the mind orient you in a case of “ tut-tut ” “ there there ” and “ you ’ re young yet ” but how many times did you posture yourself for the broad body of him or him and open like home — his hands in your hair your nerves rising kinetically to the cupola of his palms lovers ’ propensity for being a keep and your saying when you mean it “ i am yours. ” we fix you in the mind as bright-sighted seminar dipping from the source all that you know but how often did your eyes light in flirtation or fight working from his getting your dander up to his oval mouth there there your teasing tut-tut in arousing admonition at what he was after knowing as you prepared to keep him that you were young yet and gleaning gleaning

there is a garden in her face where roses and white lilies blow a heavenly paradise is that place wherein all pleasant fruits do flow there cherries grow which none may buy till “ cherry-ripe ” themselves do cry those cherries fairly do enclose of orient pearl a double row which when her lovely laughter shows they look like rose-buds filled with snow yet them no peer nor prince can buy till “ cherry-ripe ” themselves do cry her eyes like angels watch them still her brows like bended bows do stand threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill all that attempt with eye or hand those sacred cherries to come nigh till “ cherry-ripe ” themselves do cry
off highway 106 at cherrylog road i entered the ’ 34 ford without wheels smothered in kudzu with a seat pulled out to run corn whiskey down from the hills and then from the other side crept into an essex with a rumble seat of red leather and then out again aboard a blue chevrolet releasing the rust from its other color reared up on three building blocks none had the same body heat i changed with them inward toward the weedy heart of the junkyard for i knew that doris holbrook would escape from her father at noon and would come from the farm to seek parts owned by the sun among the abandoned chassis sitting in each in turn as i did leaning forward as in a wild stock-car race in the parking lot of the dead time after time i climbed in and out the other side like an envoy or movie star met at the station by crickets a radiator cap raised its head become a real toad or a kingsnake as i neared the hub of the yard passing through many states many lives to reach some grandmother ’ s long pierce-arrow sending platters of blindness forth from its nickel hubcaps and spilling its tender upholstery on sleepy roaches the glass panel in between lady and colored driver not all the way broken out the back-seat phone still on its hook i got in as though to exclaim “ let us go to the orphan asylum john i have some old toys for children who say their prayers. ” i popped with sweat as i thought i heard doris holbrook scrape like a mouse in the southern-state sun that was eating the paint in blisters from a hundred car tops and hoods she was tapping like code loosening the screws carrying off headlights sparkplugs bumpers cracked mirrors and gear-knobs getting ready already to go back with something to show other than her lips ’ new trembling i would hold to me soon soon where i sat in the ripped back seat talking over the interphone praying for doris holbrook to come from her father ’ s farm and to get back there with no trace of me on her face to be seen by her red-haired father who would change in the squalling barn her back ’ s pale skin with a strop then lay for me in a bootlegger ’ s roasting car with a string-triggered i2-gauge shotgun to blast the breath from the air not cut by the jagged windshields through the acres of wrecks she came with a wrench in her hand through dust where the blacksnake dies of boredom and the beetle knows the compost has no more life someone outside would have seen the oldest car 's door inexplicably close from within i held her and held her and held her convoyed at terrific speed by the stalled dreaming traffic around us so the blacksnake stiff with inaction curved back into life and hunted the mouse with deadly overexcitement the beetles reclaimed their field as we clung glued together with the hooks of the seat springs working through to catch us red-handed amidst the gray breathless batting that burst from the seat at our backs we left by separate doors into the changed other bodies of cars she down cherrylog road and i to my motorcycle parked like the soul of the junkyard restored a bicycle fleshed with power and tore off up highway 106 continually drunk on the wind in my mouth wringing the handlebar for speed wild to be wreckage forever
the dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows pasted with colored squares past the man who leans into the phone booth ’ s red pagoda past crates of doves and roosters veiled until dawn fireworks complicate the streets with sulphur as people exchange gold and silver foil money to appease ghosts who linger needy even in death i am almost invisible hands could pass through me effortlessly this is how it is to be so alien that my name falls from me grows untranslatable as the shop signs the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle in the stairwell the corridor where the doors are blue months ajar hands gesture in the smoke the partial moon of a face for hours the soft numeric click of mah-jongg tiles drifts down the hallway where languid mai trails her musk of sex and narcotics there is no grief in this only the old year consuming itself the door knob blazing in my hand beneath the lightbulb ’ s electric jewel between voices and fireworks wind works bricks to dust—hush hush— no language i want to learn i can touch the sill worn by hands i ’ ll never know in this room with its low table where i brew chrysanthemum tea the sign for jade palace sheds green corollas on the floor it ’ s dangerous to stand here in the chastening glow darkening my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest of my life widening away from me waiting for the man i married to pass beneath the sign of the building to climb the five flights and say his chinese name for me he ’ ll rise up out of the puzzling streets where men pass bottles of rice liquor where the new year is liquor the black bottle the whole district is waiting for like some benevolent arrest—the moment when men and women turn to each other and dissolve each bad bet every sly mischance the dalliance of hands they turn in lamplight the way i turn now wai min is in the doorway he brings fish he brings lotus root he brings me ghost money

“ a woman for whom great gods might strive ” i said and kissed her there and then i thought of the other five and of how charms outwear i thought of the first with her eating eyes and i thought of the second with hers green-gray and i thought of the third experienced wise and i thought of the fourth who sang all day and i thought of the fifth whom i 'd called a jade and i thought of them all tear-fraught and that each had shown her a passable maid yet not of the favour sought so i traced these words on the bark of a beech just at the falling of the mast “ after scanning five yes each and each i 've found the woman desired – at last ” “ –i feel a strange benumbing spell as one ill-wished ” said she and soon it seemed that something fell was starving her love for me “ i feel some curse o five were there ” and wanly she swerved and went away i followed sick night numbed the air and dark the mournful moorland lay i cried “ o darling turn your head ” but never her face i viewed “ o turn o turn ” again i said and miserably pursued at length i came to a christ-cross stone which she had passed without discern and i knelt upon the leaves there strown and prayed aloud that she might turn i rose and looked and turn she did i cried “ my heart revives ” “ look more ” she said i looked as bid her face was all the five 's all the five women clear come back i saw in her – with her made one the while she drooped upon the track and her frail term seemed well-nigh run she 'd half forgot me in her change “ who are you wo n't you say who you may be you man so strange following since yesterday ” i took the composite form she was and carried her to an arbour small not passion-moved but even because in one i could atone to all and there she lies and there i tend till my life 's threads unwind a various womanhood in blend – not one but all combined
when you take the lost road you come to the snow and when you find the snow you get down on your hands and knees like a sick dog that ’ s been eating the grasses of graveyards for twenty centuries when you take the lost road you find woman who has no fear of light who can kill two cocks at once light which has no fear of cocks and cocks who can ’ t call in the snow you find lovers who ’ ve been listening for the same roosters to sing for twenty centuries roosters that have swallowed stones out of each other ’ s tracks but have never met anywhere on the road when you take the lost road you find the bright feathers of morning laid out in proportion to snow and light and when the snow gets lost on the road then the hot wind might blow from the south and there is sadness in bed for twenty centuries and everyone is chewing the grass on the graves again when you get lost you come to the moon in the field the light all lovers soil the sheet no one leaves clean the light cocks are afraid to cross the same moon woman danced under for twenty centuries with blood on her face when you get lost on the road you run into the dead who have broken down stones in their throats for twenty centuries i saw two little crazy boys crying because it was morning and when morning comes it comes in the morning and never at night i saw two security police taking out a man ’ s balls and i saw two little crazy boys crying by the road who wouldn ’ t go away but two has never been a number because it ’ s only legal to pass one at a time it ’ s only a drum you can carry but you can ’ t beat it ’ s the evidence they need to make you disappear
the last light of a july evening drained into the streets below my love and i had hard things to say and hear and we sat over wine faltering picking our words carefully the afternoon before i had lain across my bed and my cat leapt up to lie alongside me purring and slowly growing dozy by this ritual i could clear some clutter from my baroque brain and into that brief vacancy the image of a horse cantered coming straight to me and i knew it brought hard talk and hurt and fear how did we do a medium job which is well above average but because she had opened her heart to me as far as she did i saw her fierce privacy like a gnarled luxuriant tree all hung with disappointments and i knew that to love her i must love the tree and the nothing it cares for me

the clouds as i see them rising urgently roseate in the mounting of somber power surging in evening haste over roofs and hermetic grim walls— last night as if death had lit a pale light in your flesh your flesh was cold to my touch or not cold but cool cooling as if the last traces of warmth were still fading in you my thigh burned in cold fear where yours touched it but i forced to mind my vision of a sky close and enclosed unlike the space in which these clouds move— a sky of gray mist it appeared— and how looking intently at it we saw its gray was not gray but a milky white in which radiant traces of opal greens fiery blues gleamed faded gleamed again and how only then seeing the color in the gray a field sprang into sight extending between where we stood and the horizon a field of freshest deep spiring grass starred with dandelions green and gold gold and green alternating in closewoven chords madrigal field is death ’ s chill that visited our bed other than what it seemed is it a gray to be watched keenly wiping my glasses and leaning westward clearing my mind of the day ’ s mist and leaning into myself to see the colors of truth i watch the clouds as i see them in pomp advancing pursuing the fallen sun

“ the writer it ’ s a cul-de-sac ” you wrote that winter of our nation ’ s discontent that first time i found you blue marble lying still in the trench you staked in waiting for something anything but

smashed on the page of some paper let it go is my morning mantra gone blind with the saved backing of a clock now dark as an empty womb when i wake now listening for your tick or the sound of white walls on a sticky street engines out the window remind me of breathing apparatus at the breaking of new worlds the crash and perpetual maligning of the sand bar where sea lions sawed up logs for a winter cabin i dream wood smoke in the morning i dream the rank and file of used up chimneys what that night must have smelled like her mussed and toweled positioning my ambulance of heart through stopped traffic where you picked the right corner to tell me they think someone murdered her you were there all right you were a statue carved from the stone of your birth you were patient as a sparrow under leaf and as calm as the bay those light evenings when i envisioned you with the fishwife you loved and yes i could have done it then kissed it off when the scalpel of single star brightened and my world blazed a dying bulb for the finger of a socket like our sunsets on the cape fallen fish blood in snow the hearts and diamonds we found and left alone on a new england grave why was the summer so long then even now a golden season stumps me and i stamp ants on the brilliant iced drifts i walk a steady mile to that place where you left it that solid gold band thrown away to a riptide in a gesture the theatrical love—so well what was my role or did i leave it undelivered when they handed me the gun of my triggered smiles and taught me to cock it did i play it to the hilt and bleeding did i plunge in your lap and wake to find you lonely in a ribbon of breathing tissue does this impudent muscle die does love expire do eternal nestings mean much more than a quill gone out or the spit i spy the bank of frothed fog fuming with airbrushed pussies on a pink horizon i scored my shoes with walking my skill is losing it ’ s what we do best us ducks us lessons on what not to do thanks for the crack you wrote in my o.e.d that 30th renewal when the summer snapped and hissed suddenly like a bullet of coal flung from a fire place or a dumb swallow who dove into the pit for pay kiss her and it ’ s good luck i palm this lucky trade but the soot never sells and i never sailed away on a gulf stream that divides continents from ourselves but only half of me is cracked the other is launched on a wild bob a buoy steadfast in storm i may sail to asia or i might waft aimlessly to spain where my hemp first dried from the rain my messages wring from the line unanswered pressed sheets from an old wash or the impression of a holy thing but don ’ t pull no science on this shroud the date will only lie she ’ ll tell you it ’ s sacred even sell you a piece of the fray she appears on the cracked ravines of this country like a ghost on the windshield of an oncoming train she refuses to die but just look at her nation without a spare penny to change my wear is a glass made clean through misuse the mishandling of my age as revealing as my erased face indian head of my stick birth my battle buried under an island of snow i ’ ve yet to get to what could i do with this neighborhood of avenues scattered with empty shells of mailboxes their feet caked with cement like pulled up pilings evidently they haven ’ t a word for regret full heart someday i said i can write us both from this mess but the key stalls out from under me when i spell your name i have to fake the o or go over it again in the dark a tracing of differences spilled out on a sheet if i could stick this back together would it stay it ’ s no rope i know and no good for holding clear liquid i gather a froth on my gums and grin the way an old woman grimaces in a morning mirror i was never a clear thing never felt the way a daughter feels never lost out like you never drove my moon waits at the edge of an eagle ’ s aerie almost extinct and the eggs are fragile from poisoned ignitions i ’ m never coming out from my cup of tea never working loose the grease in my hair the monkey grease from my dancing elbows that jab at your shoulder but i write and wait for the book to sell for i know nothing comes of it but the past with its widening teeth with its meat breath baited at my neck persistent as the smell of a drunk don ’ t tell me i already know it ’ s just the rule of the game for the jack of all hearts and for the queen of baguettes it ’ s a cul-de-sac for a joker drawing hearts
benedicite whate dreamed i this nyght methought the worlde was turnyd up so downe the sun the moone had lost their force and lyght the sea also drowned both toure and towne yet more marvel how that i heard the sounde of onys voice saying beare in thy mynd thi lady hath forgotten to be kynd
all trembling in my arms aminta lay defending of the bliss i strove to take raising my rapture by her kind delay her force so charming was and weak the soft resistance did betray the grant while i pressed on the heaven of my desires her rising breasts with nimbler motions pant her dying eyes assume new fires now to the height of languishment she grows and still her looks new charms put on now the last mystery of love she knows we sigh and kiss i waked and all was done ‘ twas but a dream yet by my heart i knew which still was panting part of it was true oh how i strove the rest to have believed ashamed and angry to be undeceived
spiked sun the hudson ’ s whittled down by ice i hear the bone dice of blown gravel clicking bone- pale the recent snow fastens like fur to the river standstill we were leaving to deliver christmas presents when the tire blew last year above the dead valves pines pared down by a storm stood limbs bared i want you
come to me in the silence of the night come in the speaking silence of a dream come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright as sunlight on a stream come back in tears o memory hope love of finished years oh dream how sweet too sweet too bitter sweet whose wakening should have been in paradise where souls brimfull of love abide and meet where thirsting longing eyes watch the slow door that opening letting in lets out no more yet come to me in dreams that i may live my very life again tho ’ cold in death come back to me in dreams that i may give pulse for pulse breath for breath speak low lean low as long ago my love how long ago
how much shall i love her for life or not long “ not long. ” alas when forget her in years or by june “ by june. ” and whom woo i after no one or a throng “ a throng. ” of these shall i wed one long hence or quite soon “ quite soon. ” and which will my bride be the right or the wrong “ the wrong. ” and my remedy – what kind wealth-wove or earth-hewn “ earth-hewn ”

after ovid in summer ’ s heat and mid-time of the day to rest my limbs upon a bed i lay one window shut the other open stood which gave such light as twinkles in a wood like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun or night being past and yet not day begun such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown where they may sport and seem to be unknown then came corinna in a long loose gown her white neck hid with tresses hanging down resembling fair semiramis going to bed or laïs of a thousand wooers sped i snatched her gown being thin the harm was small yet strived she to be covered therewithal and striving thus as one that would be cast betrayed herself and yielded at the last stark naked as she stood before mine eye not one wen in her body could i spy what arms and shoulders did i touch and see how apt her breasts were to be pressed by me how smooth a belly under her waist saw i how large a leg and what a lusty thigh to leave the rest all liked me passing well i clinged her naked body down she fell judge you the rest being tired she bad me kiss jove send me more such afternoons as this

all day i tried to distinguish need from desire now in the dark i feel only bitter sadness for us the builders the planers of wood because i have been looking steadily at these elms and seen the process that creates the writhing stationary tree is torment and have understood it will make no forms but twisted forms
we walk by the sea-shore holding firmly in our hands the two ends of an antique dialogue —do you love me —i love you with furrowed eyebrows i summarize all wisdom of the two testaments astrologers prophets philosophers of the gardens and cloistered philosophers and it sounds about like this —don ’ t cry —be brave —look how everybody you pout your lips and say —you should be a clergyman and fed up you walk off nobody loves moralists what should i say on the shore of a small dead sea slowly the water fills the shapes of feet which have vanished

as some fond virgin whom her mother ’ s care drags from the town to wholesome country air just when she learns to roll a melting eye and hear a spark yet think no danger nigh from the dear man unwillingly she must sever yet takes one kiss before she parts for ever thus from the world fair zephalinda flew saw others happy and with sighs withdrew not that their pleasures caused her discontent she sighed not that they stayed but that she went she went to plain-work and to purling brooks old-fashioned halls dull aunts and croaking rooks she went from opera park assembly play to morning walks and prayers three hours a day to pass her time ‘ twixt reading and bohea to muse and spill her solitary tea or o ’ er cold coffee trifle with the spoon count the slow clock and dine exact at noon divert her eyes with pictures in the fire hum half a tune tell stories to the squire up to her godly garret after seven there starve and pray for that ’ s the way to heaven some squire perhaps you take a delight to rack whose game is whisk whose treat a toast in sack who visits with a gun presents you birds then gives a smacking buss and cries – no words or with his hound comes hollowing from the stable makes love with nods and knees beneath a table whose laughs are hearty tho ’ his jests are coarse and loves you best of all things – but his horse in some fair evening on your elbow laid your dream of triumphs in the rural shade in pensive thought recall the fancied scene see coronations rise on every green before you pass th ’ imaginary sights of lords and earls and dukes and gartered knights while the spread fan o ’ ershades your closing eyes then give one flirt and all the vision flies thus vanish scepters coronets and balls and leave you in lone woods or empty walls so when your slave at some dear idle time not plagued with headaches or the want of rhyme stands in the streets abstracted from the crew and while he seems to study thinks of you just when his fancy points your sprightly eyes or sees the blush of soft parthenia rise gay pats my shoulder and you vanish quite streets chairs and coxcombs rush upon my sight vexed to be still in town i knit my brow look sour and hum a tune – as you may now
she has attained the permanence she dreamed of where old stones lie sunning untended stalks blow over her even and swift like young men running always in the heart she loved others had lived —she heard their laughter she lies where none has lain before where certainly none will follow after
why hast thou nothing in thy face thou idol of the human race thou tyrant of the human heart the flower of lovely youth that art yea and that standest in thy youth an image of eternal truth with thy exuberant flesh so fair that only pheidias might compare ere from his chaste marmoreal form time had decayed the colours warm like to his gods in thy proud dress thy starry sheen of nakedness surely thy body is thy mind for in thy face is nought to find only thy soft unchristen ’ d smile that shadows neither love nor guile but shameless will and power immense in secret sensuous innocence o king of joy what is thy thought i dream thou knowest it is nought and wouldst in darkness come but thou makest the light where ’ er thou go ah yet no victim of thy grace none who e ’ er long ’ d for thy embrace hath cared to look upon thy face
she fears him and will always ask what fated her to choose him she meets in his engaging mask all reasons to refuse him but what she meets and what she fears are less than are the downward years drawn slowly to the foamless weirs of age were she to lose him between a blurred sagacity that once had power to sound him and love that will not let him be the judas that she found him her pride assuages her almost as if it were alone the cost.— he sees that he will not be lost and waits and looks around him a sense of ocean and old trees envelops and allures him tradition touching all he sees beguiles and reassures him and all her doubts of what he says are dimmed with what she knows of days— till even prejudice delays and fades and she secures him the falling leaf inaugurates the reign of her confusion the pounding wave reverberates the dirge of her illusion and home where passion lived and died becomes a place where she can hide while all the town and harbor side vibrate with her seclusion we tell you tapping on our brows the story as it should be — as if the story of a house were told or ever could be we ’ ll have no kindly veil between her visions and those we have seen — as if we guessed what hers have been or what they are or would be meanwhile we do no harm for they that with a god have striven not hearing much of what we say take what the god has given though like waves breaking it may be or like a changed familiar tree or like a stairway to the sea where down the blind are driven
in one dream i am made watchful in this dream the name we never clearly have heard is spoken which name if we knew and could speak it would call back to us those whom in time we will have come to love and who will die would bring them back to us like us abandoned again to his terrible consequence the silence between us forever affirmed and in whatever might constitute the pardon would come down in a fragile rain the whole matter of all we will ever love the whole fiery blade of space ten billions of suns suddenly blossoming small and cool as snowdrops over the opening graves the world shimmering with the blue delicate membrane of the fallen sky while above us the forsaken voice calls out come back come back as if calling the name each of us had long forgotten until that very instant not remembered as proper to our hearts
wipe away tears set free your fears everything is free only the lonely need much money everything is free don ’ t try to bind the love you find everyone is free your lover ’ s yours — surrender force everyone is free the sun melts down spreads gold around everything is free the rain is spent lending flowers scent everything is free the love you live the life you give everything is free

imagine a child from virginia or new hampshire alone on the prairie eighty years ago or more one afternoon—the shaggy pelt of grasses for the first time in that child ’ s life flowing for miles imagine the moving shadow of a cloud far off across that shadeless ocean the obliterating strangeness like a tide that pulls or empties the bubble of the child ’ s imaginary heart no hills no trees the child ’ s heart lightens tending like a bubble towards the currents of the grass and sky the pure potential of the clear blank spaces or imagine the child in a draw that holds a garden cupped from the limitless motion of the prairie head resting against a pumpkin in evening sun ground-cherry bushes grow along the furrows the fruit red under its papery moth-shaped sheath grasshoppers tumble among the vines as large as dragons in the crumbs of pale dry earth the ground is warm to the child ’ s cheek and the wind is a humming sound in the grass above the draw rippling the shadows of the red-green blades the bubble of the child ’ s heart melts a little because the quiet of that air and earth is like the shadow of a peaceful death— limitless and potential a kind of space where one dissolves to become a part of something entire ... whether of sun and air or goodness and knowledge it does not matter to the child dissolved among the particles of the garden or into the motion of the grass and air imagine the child happy to be a thing imagine then that on that same wide prairie some people are threshing in the terrible heat with horses and machines cutting bands and shoveling amid the clatter of the threshers the chaff in prickly clouds and the naked sun burning as if it could set the chaff on fire imagine that the people are swedes or germans some of them resting pressed against the strawstacks trying to get the meager shade a man a tramp comes laboring across the stubble like a mirage against that blank horizon laboring in his torn shoes toward the tall mirage-like images of the tilted threshers clattering in the heat because the swedes or germans have no beer or else because they can not speak his language properly or for some reason one can not imagine the man climbs up on a thresher and cuts bands a minute or two then waves to one of the people a young girl or a child and jumps head-first into the sucking mouth of the machine where he is wedged and beat and cut to pieces— while the people shout and run in the clouds of chaff like lost mirages on the pelt of prairie the obliterating strangeness and the spaces are as hard to imagine as the love of death ... which is the love of an entire strangeness the contagious blankness of a quiet plain imagine that a man who had seen a prairie should write a poem about a dark or shadow that seemed to be both his and the prairie ’ s—as if the shadow proved that he was not a man but something that lived in quiet like the grass imagine that the man who writes that poem stunned by the loneliness of that wide pelt should prove to himself that he was like a shadow or like an animal living in the dark in the dark proof he finds in his poem the man might come to think of himself as the very prairie the sod itself not lonely and immune to death none of this happens precisely as i try to imagine that it does in the empty plains and yet it happens in the imagination of part of the country not in any place more than another on the map but rather like a place where you and i have never been and need to try to imagine—place like a prairie where immigrants in the obliterating strangeness thirst for the wide contagion of the shadow or prairie—where you and i with our other ways more like the cities or the hills or trees less like the clear blank spaces with their potential are like strangers in a place we must imagine
in aesop ’ s tales an honest wretch we find whose years and comforts equally declined he in two wives had two domestic ills for different age they had and different wills one plucked his black hairs out and one his gray the man for quietness did both obey till all his parish saw his head quite bare and thought he wanted brains as well as hair the moral the parties henpecked william are thy wives the hairs they pluck are thy prerogatives tories thy person hate the whigs thy power though much thou yieldest still they tug for more till this poor man and thou alike are shown he without hair and thou without a crown
if one could have that little head of hers painted upon a background of pale gold such as the tuscan ’ s early art prefers no shade encroaching on the matchless mould of those two lips which should be opening soft in the pure profile not as when she laughs for that spoils all but rather as if aloft yon hyacinth she loves so leaned its staff ’ s burthen of honey-coloured buds to kiss and capture ’ twixt the lips apart for this then her lithe neck three fingers might surround how it should waver on the pale gold ground up to the fruit-shaped perfect chin it lifts i know correggio loves to mass in rifts of heaven his angel faces orb on orb breaking its outline burning shades absorb but these are only massed there i should think waiting to see some wonder momently grow out stand full fade slow against the sky that ’ s the pale ground you ’ d see this sweet face by all heaven meanwhile condensed into one eye which fears to lose the wonder should it wink
everyone forgets that icarus also flew it 's the same when love comes to an end or the marriage fails and people say they knew it was a mistake that everybody said it would never work that she was old enough to know better but anything worth doing is worth doing badly like being there by that summer ocean on the other side of the island while love was fading out of her the stars burning so extravagantly those nights that anyone could tell you they would never last every morning she was asleep in my bed like a visitation the gentleness in her like antelope standing in the dawn mist each afternoon i watched her coming back through the hot stony field after swimming the sea light behind her and the huge sky on the other side of that listened to her while we ate lunch how can they say the marriage failed like the people who came back from provence when it was provence and said it was pretty but the food was greasy i believe icarus was not failing as he fell but just coming to the end of his triumph
maybe you need to write a poem about grace when everything broken is broken and everything dead is dead and the hero has looked into the mirror with complete contempt and the heroine has studied her face and its defects remorselessly and the pain they thought might as a token of their earnestness release them from themselves has lost its novelty and not released them and they have begun to think kindly and distantly watching the others go about their days— likes and dislikes reasons habits fears— that self-love is the one weedy stalk of every human blossoming and understood therefore why they had been all their lives in such a fury to defend it and that no one— except some almost inconceivable saint in his pool of poverty and silence—can escape this violent automatic life ’ s companion ever maybe then ordinary light faint music under things a hovering like grace appears as in the story a friend told once about the time he tried to kill himself his girl had left him bees in the heart then scorpions maggots and then ash he climbed onto the jumping girder of the bridge the bay side a blue lucid afternoon and in the salt air he thought about the word “ seafood ” that there was something faintly ridiculous about it no one said “ landfood. ” he thought it was degrading to the rainbow perch he ’ d reeled in gleaming from the cliffs the black rockbass scales like polished carbon in beds of kelp along the coast—and he realized that the reason for the word was crabs or mussels clams otherwise the restaurants could just put “ fish ” up on their signs and when he woke—he ’ d slept for hours curled up on the girder like a child—the sun was going down and he felt a little better and afraid he put on the jacket he ’ d used for a pillow climbed over the railing carefully and drove home to an empty house there was a pair of her lemon yellow panties hanging on a doorknob he studied them much-washed a faint russet in the crotch that made him sick with rage and grief he knew more or less where she was a flat somewhere on russian hill they ’ d have just finished making love she ’ d have tears in her eyes and touch his jawbone gratefully “ god ” she ’ d say “ you are so good for me. ” winking lights a foggy view downhill toward the harbor and the bay “ you ’ re sad ” he ’ d say “ yes. ” “ thinking about nick ” “ yes ” she ’ d say and cry “ i tried so hard ” sobbing now “ i really tried so hard. ” and then he ’ d hold her for a while— guatemalan weavings from his fieldwork on the wall— and then they ’ d fuck again and she would cry some more and go to sleep and he he would play that scene once only once and a half and tell himself that he was going to carry it for a very long time and that there was nothing he could do but carry it he went out onto the porch and listened to the forest in the summer dark madrone bark cracking and curling as the cold came up it ’ s not the story though not the friend leaning toward you saying “ and then i realized— ” which is the part of stories one never quite believes i had the idea that the world ’ s so full of pain it must sometimes make a kind of singing and that the sequence helps as much as order helps— first an ego and then pain and then the singing
for caroline ireland they were to have been a love gift but when she slit the paper funnel they both saw they were fake false flowers he 'd picked in haste from the store 's display handmade coloured stuff stiff as crinoline instantly she thought of women 's hands cutting in grimy light by a sweatshop window rough plank tables strewn with cut-out flower heads lily iris primula scentless chrysanthemums pistils rigged on wire in crowns of sponge-tipped stamens sepals and petals perfect perfectly immune to menaces from the garden why so wrong so ... flattening why not instead symbols of unchanging love yet pretty enough she considered arranging them in a vase with dry grass and last summer 's hydrangeas whose deadness was still how to put it alive or maybe the other side of life two sides really of the same thing she laughed a little such ideas were embarrassing even when kept to oneself but her train of thought carried her in its private tunnel through supper and at bedtime brushing her teeth she happened to look up at the moon its sunlit face was turned as always in her direction the full moon she could n't help thinking though we see only half of it it was an insight she decided she could share with him but when he joined her and together they lay in the dark there seemed no reason to say anything the words in any case would be wrong would escape or disfigure her meaning good was the syllable she murmured to him fading into sleep and just for a split second teetering on the verge of it she believed everything that had to be was understood

farewell false love the oracle of lies a mortal foe and enemy to rest an envious boy from whom all cares arise a bastard vile a beast with rage possessed a way of error a temple full of treason in all effects contrary unto reason a poisoned serpent covered all with flowers mother of sighs and murderer of repose a sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers as moisture lend to every grief that grows a school of guile a net of deep deceit a gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait a fortress foiled which reason did defend a siren song a fever of the mind a maze wherein affection finds no end a raging cloud that runs before the wind a substance like the shadow of the sun a goal of grief for which the wisest run a quenchless fire a nurse of trembling fear a path that leads to peril and mishap a true retreat of sorrow and despair an idle boy that sleeps in pleasure 's lap a deep mistrust of that which certain seems a hope of that which reason doubtful deems sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed and for my faith ingratitude i find and sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed whose course was ever contrary to kind false love desire and beauty frail adieu dead is the root whence all these fancies grew
for stephen a blind girl steps over the red staves of a tub steam rising from her shoulders and hair she walks across a dirt floor to you i think you are not her grandfather you watch with her a pink man who has avoided taxes for two winters— he is being judged by roosters and has been chased this far into the countryside above him burning sacks of bat dung are arranged in the purple branches of the thistle trees the river is indifferent to him and so are we you tell your mistress the burning bags of shit are like inert buddhas dissolving in a field of merit she giggles a front tooth is loose with the river bottom clear as the night air the bargeman sings through the hungry vapors rising now like white snakes behind him you told his wife that lord buddha made wasps from yellow stalks of tobacco with a dark spit down in the cold bamboo a starving woman has opened a small pig— the old moons climb from its blue glistening stomach or is it light from the infinitely receding sacks of shit master where is the difference

all the angels of tie siding were on fire the famous sky was gone presumably the mountains were still there invisible in haze ok there was only one angel but she was a torch in the wind beside the wind-ripped american flag the post office flies ok she wasn't literally on fire maybe her angelic red hair made me think she was ablaze as it flaunted the prairie and made a festival of itself there was a fireworks stand nearby entirely beside the point as was the fourth of july it was really dry it was fire season it was the wind festival featuring an angel standing in it letting her red hair conflagrate history reduce it to ash bid it start anew erase the sky with atrocity 's own smoke she wore besides her flame of hair blue jeans and a singlet she was violent in the wind i started walking toward her i 'm still walking toward her no idea what to say when i get there

i ne ’ er was struck before that hour with love so sudden and so sweet her face it bloomed like a sweet flower and stole my heart away complete my face turned pale as deadly pale my legs refused to walk away and when she looked what could i ail my life and all seemed turned to clay and then my blood rushed to my face and took my eyesight quite away the trees and bushes round the place seemed midnight at noonday i could not see a single thing words from my eyes did start— they spoke as chords do from the string and blood burnt round my heart are flowers the winter ’ s choice is love ’ s bed always snow she seemed to hear my silent voice not love 's appeals to know i never saw so sweet a face as that i stood before my heart has left its dwelling-place and can return no more
i like to touch your tattoos in complete darkness when i can ’ t see them i ’ m sure of where they are know by heart the neat lines of lightning pulsing just above your nipple can find as if by instinct the blue swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent twists facing a dragon when i pull you to me taking you until we ’ re spent and quiet on the sheets i love to kiss the pictures in your skin they ’ ll last until you ’ re seared to ashes whatever persists or turns to pain between us they will still be there such permanence is terrifying so i touch them in the dark but touch them trying

or the unfortunate story of the unmarried flora carrillo and the man who loved her before he died his famous death from whose single liaison a daughter was born and the advice rather the explanation both of them left for her and the story also of what she became and that she was happy 1. three did not count a fourth was forgiven by the father torres in exchange for reasonable payment two full days of the hail mary bigger than priests the fifth indiscretion was born on a thursday early evening in a november not too cold no rain had fallen and the birds had not yet gone she chose a black dress this flora florita here evoke the names of saints underneath which she carried tonight an old blade but of fine toledo forging long as the member of this man in love with this woman standing at his door her head was filled with the vines of the jungle the noises of a lion the feel of ten birds trying with their beaks to get out all anger that she had hoped he would come to her bedroom and that he had faster than that she took from him his rolled tongue hanging there between his thin legs his two-fingers this girl ’ s wrist and fist of his its central tendon and skin that moved on itself this small and second body of his which had found its way to her second mouth this part of himself which he had given her then taken back on this same day earlier his ugly afternoon of loving her too much he would scream as she had when she had taken him in first as a leg-bone and held him there too long too much until he had become a pinky-finger here evoke the holy names which she took now and put in the dowry she would make for her new daughter with it she would write a note nothing else was left to do daughter you will be an only child the story of your birth will smell on you do

sang to her the oldest song that he was a piccolo flute in the small of her heart or if that were not convincing too much filled with flowers a small noise then a smart a cut which is healing its face feeling good to be scratched the way even wild cats like a piccolo flute in the small of her heart nothing more and nothing more necessary a noise different from all the rest louder and more shrill a good sound of haunting the voice of a muslim caller at dawn a bird a saturday four directions and a need he sang this and did not sing in that manner of speech afforded the heart that he was a man came to her not from any words not like that but from the measure of his breathing from the five-ladder depth of his left eye the one that did not move his one eye which while his right eye could move through the everyday could only stay looking at her when she looked at this eye at first the sight of it made a noise in her a start a note somewhere at the top of the piano scales fear almost a grasped breath a glass dropped in the moment was the music of being wanted or of wanting but she could not think it certainly she could only say no the way anyone would after a glass falls no and jesus and as an afterthought that he should go away many years later she read a book and it took her breath how neatly the glasses for champagne thrown by the fine heroes broke against the walls holding fire that this was a celebration that this was the continental the european no she said to this thick railroad tie of a man who sang to her the oldest song the one of being young that he was a piccolo flute in the small of her heart no she said but said it with her mouth not with her heart making no a spoken word like all other words so that he did not hear so that he kept singing until one day it was enough but not for her not now now instead the afternoon which was kind which is what she was earlier had only pretended for him i am her whispered it to him let him be strong in its arms one more time before it took him holding tighter than a grandmother this was not at all what he wanted but what he wanted he could not have no she said and he could not get close enough could not put the ear of his song heart against her chest to know what the word meant no 3. he had written no note for his daughter it had not been necessary she knew now what it would have been what the word no means when it is pronounced when the last half of it lingers o imagined that the o was like this together as if it were new nude in the afternoon they must have danced the wild apache without lunch into the hours imagining themselves french striped shirt and berets two carp on a rug in the ocean of the room two june beetles two bees beings with impossible wings pulleys from the roof pulling the two of them up like birthday piñatas two of them then four hands and legs tied more expertly than the best dream of an old salt sailor bread dough wound round and again into afternoon cakes two four then six of them all the parts of the face then twelve of them their two faces together twenty-four then and thirty-six and words and breaths inside each other their tongues like the wings of hummingbirds in flight like bees his fingers faster than possible that it was like this exactly 4. her fame was as a maker of oval mats many years later mats for placement behind photographs how the old ones were sometimes in colors sometimes to highlight sometimes for support simply always making the best faces but what she loved most what was true for her was her firm putting of the tongues and most heavy parts of several men of the town each on a different night sundays being specially reserved for the troubled boy on a rancho several kilometers out of town putting them slowly into her mouth this best of all and sucking there at them better than if she were drawing out the juice of an orange small hole made in it the way children do squeezing out the everything it was better described this deliverance of her men this taking out from their baby-arms what it was that troubled them so much all at once so much like the stories she had heard of the ghost being delivered being let go from the mouth exactly at the point of death she would trade nothing for this for being able to say yes where others had said no to say yes and watch her men die die and then be brought back to be strong at this this was her power this is what made her laugh being her mother and her father both being happy for them all never once making love to a man

after the clash of elevator gates and the long sinking she emerges where a slight thing in the morning ’ s crosstown glare she looks up toward the window where he waits then in a fleeting taxi joins the rest of the huge traffic bound forever west on such grand scale do lovers say good-bye— even this other pair whose high romance had only the duration of a dance and who now taking leave with stricken eye see each in each a whole new life forgone for them above the darkling clubhouse lawn bright perseids flash and crumble while for these who part now on the dock weighed down by grief and baggage yet with something like relief it takes three thousand miles of knitting seas to cancel out their crossing and unmake the amorous rough and tumble of their wake we are denied my love their fine tristesse and bittersweet regrets and can not share the frequent vistas of their large despair where love and all are swept to nothingness still there ’ s a certain scope in that long love which constant spirits are the keepers of and which though taken to be tame and staid is a wild sostenuto of the heart a passion joined to courtesy and art which has the quality of something made like a good fiddle like the rose ’ s scent like a rose window or the firmament

they caught them they were sitting at a table in the kitchen it was early they had on bathrobes they were drinking coffee and smiling she had one of his cigarillos in her fingers she had her legs tucked up under her in the chair they saw them through the window she thought of them stepping out of a bath and him wrapping cloth around her he thought of her waking up in a small white building he thought of stones settling into the ground then they were gone then they came in through the back her cat ran out the house was near the road she didn ’ t like the cat going out they stayed at the table the others were out of breath the man and the woman reached across the table they were afraid they smiled the others poured themselves the last of the coffee burning their tongues the man and the woman looked at them they didn ’ t say anything the man and the woman moved closer to each other the round table between them the stove was still on and burned the empty pot she started to get up one of them shot her she leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons she thought about being beside him being asleep they took her long grey socks put them over the barrel of a rifle and shot him he went back in his chair holding himself she told him hers didn ’ t hurt much like in the fall when everything you touch makes a spark he thought about her getting up in the dark wrapping a quilt around herself and standing in the doorway she asked the men if they shot them again not to hurt their faces one of them lit him one of his cigarettes he thought what it would be like being children together he was dead before he finished it she asked them could she take it out of his mouth so it wouldn ’ t burn his lips she reached over and touched his hair she thought about him walking through the dark singing she died on the table like that smoke coming out of his mouth
we sat across the table he said cut off your hands they are always poking at things they might touch me i said yes food grew cold on the table he said burn your body it is not clean and smells like sex it rubs my mind sore i said yes i love you i said that ’ s very nice he said i like to be loved that makes me happy have you cut off your hands yet

in the close covert of a grove by nature formed for scenes of love said susan in a lucky hour ‘ observe yon sweet geranium flower how straight upon its stalk it stands and tempts our violating hands whilst the soft bud as yet unspread hangs down its pale declining head yet soon as it is ripe to blow the stems shall rise the head shall glow. ’ ‘ nature ’ said i ‘ my lovely sue to all her followers lends a clue her simple laws themselves explain as links of one continued chain for her the mysteries of creation are but the works of generation yon blushing strong triumphant flower is in the crisis of its power but short alas its vigorous reign he sheds his seed and drops again the bud that hangs in pale decay feels not as yet the plastic ray tomorrow ’ s sun shall bid him rise then too he sheds his seed and dies but words my love are vain and weak for proof let bright example speak. ’ then straight before the wondering maid the tree of life i gently laid ‘ observe sweet sue his drooping head how pale how languid and how dead yet let the sun of thy bright eyes shine but a moment it shall rise let but the dew of thy soft hand refresh the stem it straight shall stand already see it swells it grows its head is redder than the rose its shriveled fruit of dusky hue now glows—a present fit for sue the balm of life each artery fills and in o ’ erflowing drops distils. ’ ‘ oh me ’ cried susan ‘ when is this what strange tumultuous throbs of bliss sure never mortal till this hour felt such emotion at a flower oh serpent cunning to deceive sure ’ tis this tree that tempted eve the crimson apples hang so fair alas what woman could forbear ’ ‘ well hast thou guessed my love ’ i cried ‘ it is the tree by which she died – the tree which could alone content her all nature susan seeks the centre yet let us still poor eve forgive it ’ s the tree by which we live for lovely women still it grows and in the centre only blows but chief for thee it spreads its charms for paradise is in thy arms … ’ i ceased for nature kindly here began to whisper in her ear and lovely sue lay softly panting while the geranium tree was planting ’ til in the heat of amorous strife she burst the mellow tree of life ‘ oh heaven ’ cried susan with a sigh ‘ the hour we taste – we surely die strange raptures seize my fainting frame and all my body glows with flame yet let me snatch one parting kiss to tell my love i die with bliss – that pleased thy susan yields her breath oh who would live if this be death ’

i i can hear little clicks inside my dream night drips its silver tap down the back at 4 a.m. i wake thinking of the man who left in september his name was law my face in the bathroom mirror has white streaks down it i rinse the face and return to bed tomorrow i am going to visit my mother she she lives on a moor in the north she lives alone spring opens like a blade there i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books— some for my mother some for me including the collected works of emily brontë this is my favourite author also my main fear which i mean to confront whenever i visit my mother i feel i am turning into emily brontë my lonely life around me like a moor my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation that dies when i come in the kitchen door what meat is it emily we need three three silent women at the kitchen table my mother ’ s kitchen is dark and small but out the window there is the moor paralyzed with ice it extends as far as the eye can see over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps once a minute over the twelve i have emily p. 216 propped open on the sugarbowl but am covertly watching my mother a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside my mother is studying her lettuce i turn to p. 217 “ in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway ” it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass now and then a remark trails through the glass taxes on the back lot not a good melon too early for melons hairdresser in town found god closes shop every tuesday mice in the teatowel drawer again little pellets chew off the corners of the napkins if they knew what paper napkins cost nowadays rain tonight rain tomorrow that volcano in the philippines at it again what ’ s her name anderson died no not shirley the opera singer negress cancer not eating your garnish you don ’ t like pimento out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth at the middle of the moor where the ground goes down into a depression the ice has begun to unclench black open water comes curdling up like anger my mother speaks suddenly that psychotherapy ’ s not doing you much good is it you aren ’ t getting over him my mother has a way of summing things up she never liked law much but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life well he ’ s a taker and you ’ re a giver i hope it works out was all she said after she met him give and take were just words to me at the time i had not been in love before it was like a wheel rolling downhill but early this morning while mother slept and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing come in come in to the ghost of his heart ’ s darling i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too she knows how to hang puppies that emily it isn ’ t like taking an aspirin you know i answer feebly dr. haw says grief is a long process she frowns what does it accomplish all that raking up the past oh—i spread my hands— i prevail i look her in the eye she grins yes you do whacher whacher emily ’ s habitual spelling of this word has caused confusion for example in the first line of the poem printed tell me whether is it winter in the shakespeare head edition but whacher is what she wrote whacher is what she was she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night she whached eyes stars inside outside actual weather she whached the bars of time which broke she whached the poor core of the world wide open to be a whacher is not a choice there is nowhere to get away from it no ledge to climb up to—like a swimmer who walks out of the water at sunset shaking the drops off it just flies open to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy although she uses these words in her verse as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel grazing with euphemism the work of whaching but it has no name it is transparent sometimes she calls it thou “ emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet ” records charlotte in 1828. unsociable even at home and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out emily made her awkward way across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers this sad stunted life says one uninteresting unremarkable wracked by disappointment and despair says another she could have been a great navigator if she ’ d been male suggests a third meanwhile emily continued to brush into the carpet the question why cast the world away for someone hooked up to thou the world may have seemed a kind of half-finished sentence but in between the neighbour who recalls her coming in from a walk on the moors with her face “ lit up by a divine light ” and the sister who tells us emily never made a friend in her life is a space where the little raw soul slips through it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel out of sight the little raw soul was caught by no one she didn ’ t have friends children sex religion marriage success a salary or a fear of death she worked in total six months of her life at a school in halifax and died on the sofa at home at 2 p.m. on a winter afternoon in her thirty-first year she spent most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet walking the moor or whaching she says it gave her peace “ all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this day 4 years ” she wrote in her diary paper of 1837. yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons vaults cages bars curbs bits bolts fetters locked windows narrow frames aching walls “ why all the fuss ” asks one critic “ she wanted liberty well didn ’ t she have it a reasonably satisfactory homelife a most satisfactory dreamlife—why all this beating of wings what was this cage invisible to us which she felt herself to be confined in ” well there are many ways of being held prisoner i am thinking as i stride over the moor as a rule after lunch mother has a nap and i go out to walk the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april carve into me with knives of light something inside it reminds me of childhood— it is the light of the stalled time after lunch when clocks tick and hearts shut and fathers leave to go back to work and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering something they never tell you remember too much my mother said to me recently why hold onto all that and i said where can i put it down she shifted to a question about airports crops of ice are changing to mud all around me as i push on across the moor warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun on the edge of the moor our pines dip and coast in breezes from somewhere else perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is to watch the year repeat its days it is as if i could dip my hand down into time and scoop up blue and green lozenges of april heat a year ago in another country i can feel that other day running underneath this one like an old videotape—here we go fast around the last corner up the hill to his house shadows of limes and roses blowing in the car window and music spraying from the radio and him singing and touching my left hand to his lips law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now still carries the sound of the telephone in that room and traffic far off and doves under the window chuckling coolly and his voice saying you beauty i can feel that beauty ’ s heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room— no i say aloud i force my arms down through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water and the videotape jerks to a halt like a glass slide under a drop of blood i stop and turn and stand into the wind which now plunges towards me over the moor when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die this is not uncommon i took up the practice of meditation each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa and chanted bits of old latin prayers de profundis clamavi ad te domine each morning a vision came to me gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul i called them nudes nude 1. woman alone on a hill she stands into the wind it is a hard wind slanting from the north long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman ’ s body and lift and blow away on the wind leaving an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle calling mutely through lipless mouth it pains me to record this i am not a melodramatic person but soul is “ hewn in a wild workshop ” as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights charlotte ’ s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist ’ s masterpiece like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte talks firmly and calmly about the other furniture of emily ’ s workshop—about the inexorable spirit “ stronger than a man simpler than a child ” the cruel illness “ pain no words can render ” the autonomous end “ she sank rapidly she made haste to leave us ” and about emily ’ s total subjection to a creative project she could neither understand nor control and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame than if she had opened her mouth “ to breathe lightning. ” the scorpion is inching down the arm of the sofa while charlotte continues to speak helpfully about lightning and other weather we may expect to experience when we enter emily ’ s electrical atmosphere it is “ a horror of great darkness ” that awaits us there but emily is not responsible emily was in the grip “ having formed these beings she did not know what she had done ” says charlotte of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine well there are many ways of being held prisoner the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee as charlotte concludes “ on herself she had no pity. ” pitiless too are the heights which emily called wuthering because of their “ bracing ventilation ” and “ a north wind over the edge. ” whaching a north wind grind the moor that surrounded her father ’ s house on every side formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities— an angry education that shapes the way her characters use one another “ my love for heathcliff ” says catherine “ resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary. ” necessary i notice the sun has dimmed and the afternoon air sharpening i turn and start to recross the moor towards home what are the imperatives that hold people like catherine and heathcliff together and apart like pores blown into hot rock and then stranded out of reach of one another when it hardens what kind of necessity is that the last time i saw law was a black night in september autumn had begun my knees were cold inside my clothes a chill fragment of moon rose he stood in my living room and spoke without looking at me not enough spin on it he said of our five years of love inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces which floated apart by now i was so cold it was like burning i put out my hand to touch his he moved back i don ’ t want to be sexual with you he said everything gets crazy but now he was looking at me yes i said as i began to remove my clothes everything gets crazy when nude i turned my back because he likes the back he moved onto me everything i know about love and its necessities i learned in that one moment when i found myself thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon at a man who no longer cherished me there was no area of my mind not appalled by this action no part of my body that could have done otherwise but to talk of mind and body begs the question soul is the place stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind where such necessity grinds itself out soul is what i kept watch on all that night law stayed with me we lay on top of the covers as if it weren ’ t really a night of sleep and time caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language like the children we used to be that was a night that centred heaven and hell as emily would say we tried to fuck but he remained limp although happy i came again and again each time accumulating lucidity until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down on the two souls clasped there on the bed with their mortal boundaries visible around them like lines on a map i saw the lines harden he left in the morning it is very cold walking into the long scraped april wind at this time of year there is no sunset just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away kitchen kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in no sound from the rest of the house i wait a moment then open the fridge brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed after extracting the yogurt container from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles i close the fridge door bluish dusk fills the room like a sea slid back i lean against the sink white foods taste best to me and i prefer to eat alone i don ’ t know why once i heard girls singing a may day song that went violante in the pantry gnawing at a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she felt herself alone girls are cruelest to themselves someone like emily brontë who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow we can see her ridding herself of it at various times with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet reason with him and then whip him was her instruction age six to her father regarding brother branwell and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode they say into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied them directly to her arm cauterization of heathcliff took longer more than thirty years in the time of the novel from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen and vanishes over the moor because he overheard half a sentence of catherine ’ s “ it would degrade me to marry heathcliff ” until the wild morning when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights heathcliff is a pain devil if he had stayed in the kitchen long enough to hear the other half of catherine ’ s sentence “ so he will never know how i love him ” heathcliff would have been set free but emily knew how to catch a devil she put into him in place of a soul the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system every time he drew a breath or moved thought she broke all his moments in half with the kitchen door standing open i am not unfamiliar with this half-life but there is more to it than that heathcliff ’ s sexual despair arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë so far as we know her question which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain devil came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen “ kichin ” in emily ’ s spelling where she and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet there is a fragment of a poem she wrote in 1839 about six years before wuthering heights that says that iron man was born like me and he was once an ardent boy he must have felt in infancy the glory of a summer sky who is the iron man my mother ’ s voice cuts across me from the next room where she is lying on the sofa is that you dear yes ma why don ’ t you turn on a light in there out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun jab its last cold yellow streaks across a dirty silver sky okay ma what ’ s for supper liberty liberty means different things to different people i have never liked lying in bed in the morning law did my mother does but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it— moving along the moor into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs and i am free out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky frozen mud crunches underfoot the sound startles me back into the dream i was having this morning when i awoke one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law ’ s arms like a needle in water—it is a physical effort to pull myself out of his white silk hands as they slide down my dream hips—i turn and face into the wind and begin to run goblins devils and death stream behind me in the days and months after law left i felt as if the sky was torn off my life i had no home in goodness anymore to see the love between law and me turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another towards some other hunger was terrible perhaps this is what people mean by original sin i thought but what love could be prior to it what is prior what is love my questions were not original nor did i answer them mornings when i meditated i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul not the complex mysteries of love and hate but the nudes are still as clear in my mind as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight there were in all thirteen of them nude 2. woman caught in a cage of thorns big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them where she twists this way and that way unable to stand upright nude 3. woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead she grips it in both hands endeavouring to wrench it out nude 4. woman on a blasted landscape backlit in red like hieronymus bosch covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption like the top half of a crab with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater she works hard at dislodging the crab it was about this time i began telling dr. haw about the nudes she said when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them why keep watching why not go away i was amazed go away where i said this still seems to me a good question but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light is filling the moor with gold milk i have reached the middle where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water it is frozen a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it and sway in the blue air each trunk where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures— thousands of hair-thin cracks catching the white of the light like a jailed face catching grins through the bars emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says a messenger of hope comes every night to me and offers for short life eternal liberty i wonder what kind of liberty this is her critics and commentators say she means death or a visionary experience that prefigures death they understand her prison as the limitations placed on a clergyman ’ s daughter by nineteenth-century life in a remote parish on a cold moor in the north of england they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life “ in so much of brontë ’ s work the self-dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama ” says one another refers to “ the cardboard sublime ” of her caught world i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes when i realized i had no way to answer her question why keep watching some people watch that ’ s all i can say there is nowhere else to go no ledge to climb up to perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment as with a very difficult sister “ on that mind time and experience alone could work to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable ” wrote charlotte of emily i wonder what kind of conversation these two had over breakfast at the parsonage “ my sister emily was not a person of demonstrative character ” charlotte emphasizes “ nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could with impunity intrude unlicensed ” recesses were many one autumn day in 1845 charlotte “ accidentally lighted on a ms. volume of verse in my sister emily ’ s handwriting. ” it was a small 4 x 6 notebook with a dark red cover marked 6d and contained 44 poems in emily ’ s minute hand charlotte had known emily wrote verse but felt “ more than surprise ” at its quality “ not at all like the poetry women generally write. ” further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily ’ s novel not least for its foul language she gently probes this recess in her editor ’ s preface to wuthering heights “ a large class of readers likewise will suffer greatly from the introduction into the pages of this work of words printed with all their letters which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter only—a blank line filling the interval. ” well there are different definitions of liberty love is freedom law was fond of saying i took this to be more a wish than a thought and changed the subject but blank lines do not say nothing as charlotte puts it “ the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse strikes me as a proceeding which however well meant is weak and futile i can not tell what good it does—what feeling it spares— what horror it conceals. ” i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor towards home and breakfast it is a two-way traffic the language of the unsaid my favourite pages of the collected works of emily brontë are the notes at the back recording small adjustments made by charlotte to the text of emily ’ s verse which charlotte edited for publication after emily ’ s death “ prison for strongest in emily ’ s hand altered to lordly by charlotte. ” hero i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast whether she had a good night and is about to say a happy thing or not not she puts her toast down on the side of her plate you know you can pull the drapes in that room she begins this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments from what i call the rules of life series my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night i open mine as wide as possible i like to see everything i say what ’ s there to see moon air sunrise all that light on your face in the morning wakes you up i like to wake up at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta and may advance along one of three channels there is the what you need is a good night ’ s sleep channel the stubborn as your father channel and random channel more toast i interpose strongly pushing back my chair those women says my mother with an exasperated rasp mother has chosen random channel women complaining about rape all the time i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday ’ s newspaper lying beside the grape jam the front page has a small feature about a rally for international women ’ s day— have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue nope why it ’ s a disgrace those bathing suits— cut way up to here she points no wonder you ’ re saying women deserve to get raped because sears bathing suit ads have high-cut legs ma are you serious well someone has to be responsible why should women be responsible for male desire my voice is high oh i see you ’ re one of them one of whom my voice is very high mother vaults it and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green one it looked so smart on you the frail fact drops on me from a great height that my mother is afraid she will be eighty years old this summer her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe make me think of emily brontë ’ s little merlin hawk hero that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn ‘ t around so ma we ’ ll go—i pop up the toaster and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate— visit dad today she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility leave at eleven home again by four i continue she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes silence is assent in our code i go into the next room to phone the taxi my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care about 50 miles from here he suffers from a kind of dementia characterized by two sorts of pathological change first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer first the presence in cerebral tissue of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells second neurofibrillary snarlings in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus there is no known cause or cure mother visits him by taxi once a week for the last five years marriage is for better or for worse she says this is the worse so about an hour later we are in the taxi shooting along empty country roads towards town the april light is clear as an alarm as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object existing in space on its own shadow i wish i could carry this clarity with me into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy these are my two wishes it is hard to find the beginning of dementia i remember a night about ten years ago when i was talking to him on the telephone it was a sunday night in winter i heard his sentences filling up with fear he would start a sentence—about weather lose his way start another it made me furious to hear him floundering— my tall proud father former world war ii navigator it made me merciless i stood on the edge of the conversation watching him thrash about for cues offering none and it came to me like a slow avalanche that he had no idea who he was talking to much colder today i guess his voice pressed into the silence and broke off snow falling on it there was a long pause while snow covered us both well i won ’ t keep you he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land i ’ ll say goodnight now i won ’ t run up your bill goodbye goodbye goodbye who are you i said into the dial tone at the hospital we pass down long pink halls through a door with a big window and a combination lock 5—25—3 to the west wing for chronic care patients each wing has a name the chronic wing is our golden mile although mother prefers to call it the last lap father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles my father tilts least i am proud of him hi dad how y ’ doing his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air my mother lays her hand on his hello love she says he jerks his hand away we sit sunlight flocks through the room mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him grapes arrowroot biscuits humbugs he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us he uses a language known only to himself made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash— you don ’ t say or happy birthday to you — but no real sentence for more than three years now i notice his front teeth are getting black i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people he always took good care of his teeth my mother looks up she and i often think two halves of one thought do you remember that gold-plated toothpick you sent him from harrod ’ s the summer you were in london she asks yes i wonder what happened to it must be in the bathroom somewhere she is giving him grapes one by one they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers he used to be a big man over six feet tall and strong but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house— except the hands the hands keep growing each one now as big as a boot in van gogh they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables that break off on a high note—he waits staring into my face that quizzical look one eyebrow at an angle i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane hands firmly behind backs legs wide apart chins forward dressed in the puffed flying suits with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942. it is dawn they are leaving dover for france my father on the far left is the tallest airman with his collar up one eyebrow at an angle the shadowless light makes him look immortal for all the world like someone who will not weep again he is still staring into my face flaps down i cry his black grin flares once and goes out like a match hot hot blue moonlight down the steep sky i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies with my eyes pouring into the dark fumbling and slowly consciousness replaces the bars dreamtails and angry liquids swim back down to the middle of me it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now this is not uncommon after loss of love— blue and black and red blasting the crater open i am interested in anger i clamber along to find the source my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires each wire has a little black switch one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on she keeps switching and switching in rising tides of very hot anger then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices at the rooms of the rest of the house the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch small creatures—not quite cats not quite rats licking their narrow red jaws under a load of time i want to be beautiful again she whispers but the great overlit rooms tick emptily as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark a rustling sound comes— my pajamas are soaked anger travels through me pushes aside everything else in my heart pouring up the vents every night i wake to this anger the soaked bed the hot pain box slamming me each way i move i want justice slam i want an explanation slam i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever slam i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp night springs out the window and is gone over the moor i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears and thinking about curses emily brontë was good at cursing falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in her verse well thou halt paid me back my love but if there be a god above whose arm is strong whose word is true this hell shall wring thy spirit too the curses are elaborate there go deceiver go my hand is streaming wet my heart ’ s blood flows to buy the blessing—to forget oh could that lost heart give back back again to thine one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline but they do not bring her peace vain words vain frenzied thoughts no ear can hear me call— lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still— life bows to my control but love i can not kill her anger is a puzzle it raises many questions in me to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt by someone who rarely left home “ except to go to church or take a walk on the hills ” charlotte tells us and who had no more intercourse with haworth folk than “ a nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates. ” how did emily come to lose faith in humans she admired their dialects studied their genealogies “ but with them she rarely exchanged a word. ” her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor what did emily know of lover ’ s lies or cursive human faith among her biographers is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child during her six-month stay in halifax but there is no evidence at all for such an event and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 years banal sexism aside i find myself tempted to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge for all that life withheld from emily but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women it is a chilly thought the heart is dead since infancy unwept for let the body go suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin the vocation of anger is not mine i know my source it is stunning it is a moment like no other when one ’ s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore i switch off the lamp and lie on my back thinking about emily ’ s cold young soul where does unbelief begin when i was young there were degrees of certainty i could say yes i know that i have two hands then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally disappear— from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle back down under the doorsill of sleep out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks of sky our guests are darkly lodged i whispered gazing through the vault thou the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness and i prefer to put it off it is morning astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east i am walking into the light one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou she describes thou as awake like herself all night and full of strange power thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind thou and emily influence one another in the darkness playing near and far at once she talks about a sweetness that “ proved us one. ” i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet there is no question it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night without the terrible sex price to pay this is a childish idea i know my education i have to admit has been gappy the basic rules of male-female relations were imparted atmospherically in our family no direct speech allowed i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car father in front we were waiting in the driveway for mother who came around the corner of the house and got into the passenger side of the car dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels father glanced sideways at her showing a good bit of leg today mother he said in a voice which i age eleven thought odd i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say her answer would clear this up but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh i overheard as i was going upstairs she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek most of the time but you know men she was saying laugh not ropes thorns i have arrived at the middle of the moor where the ground goes down into a low swampy place the swamp water is frozen solid bits of gold weed have etched themselves on the underside of the ice like messages i ’ ll come when thou art saddest laid alone in the darkened room when the mad day ’ s mirth has vanished and the smile of joy is banished i ’ ll come when the heart ’ s real feeling has entire unbiased sway and my influence o ’ er thee stealing grief deepening joy congealing shall bear thy soul away listen ’ tis just the hour the awful time for thee dost thou not feel upon thy soul a flood of strange sensations roll forerunners of a sterner power heralds of me very hard to read the messages that pass between thou and emily in this poem she reverses their roles speaking not as the victim but to the victim it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered it is a shock to realize that this low slow collusion of master and victim within one voice is a rationale for the most awful loneliness of the poet ’ s hour she has reversed the roles of thou and thou not as a display of power but to force out of herself some pity for this soul trapped in glass which is her true creation those nights lying alone are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn it is who i am is it a vocation of anger why construe silence as the real presence why stoop to kiss this doorstep why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul emily was fond of psalm 130 “ my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning. ” i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire ” in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns “ says the psalmist but for myself i do not believe this i am not quenched— with thou or without thou i find no shelter i am my own nude and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny i have watched this destiny disclose itself in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now from love to anger to this cold marrow from fire to shelter to fire what is the opposite of believing in thou— merely not believing in thou no that is too simple that is to prepare a misunderstanding i want to speak more clearly perhaps the nudes are the best way nude 5. deck of cards each card is made of flesh the living cards are days of a woman ’ s life i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to end nude 6 i can not remember nude 7. white room whose walls having neither planes nor curves nor angles are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon it is a living surface almost wet lucency breathes in and out rainbows shudder across it and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering be very careful be very careful nude 8. black disc on which the fires of all the winds are attached in a row a woman stands on the disc amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames flow and vibrate up through her nude 9. transparent loam under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench into the trench she is placing small white forms i don ’ t know what they are nude 10. green thorn of the world poking up alive through the heart of a woman who lies on her back on the ground the thorn is exploding its green blood above her in the air everything it is it has the voice says nude 11. ledge in outer space space is bluish black and glossy as solid water and moving very fast in all directions shrieking past the woman who stands pinned to nothing by its pressure she peers and glances for some way to go trying to lift her hand but can not nude 12. old pole in the wind cold currents are streaming over it and pulling out into ragged long horizontal black lines some shreds of ribbon attached to the pole i can not see how they are attached— notches staples nails all of a sudden the wind changes and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air and tie themselves into knots then untie and float down the wind is gone it waits by this time midway through winter i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama then it stopped days passed months passed and i saw nothing i continued to peer and glance sitting on the rug in front of my sofa in the curtainless morning with my nerves open to the air like something skinned i saw nothing outside the window spring storms came and went april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off and fall and i thought how slow as it glided soundlessly past but still—nothing no nudes no thou a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle hoping to trick myself into some interior vision but all i saw was the man and woman in the room across the street making their bed and laughing i stopped watching i forgot about nudes i lived my life which felt like a switched-off tv something had gone through me and out and i could not own it “ no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind emily does not feel them ” wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister emily had shaken free a soul can do that whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings you and i will never know but i can tell you what i saw nude 13 arrived when i was not watching for it it came at night very much like nude 1. and yet utterly different i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached but as i came closer i saw it was a human body trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones and there was no pain the wind was cleansing the bones they stood forth silver and necessary it was not my body not a woman ’ s body it was the body of us all it walked out of the light
a glimpse through an interstice caught of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night and i unremark ’ d seated in a corner of a youth who loves me and whom i love silently approaching and seating himself near that he may hold me by the hand a long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and oath and smutty jest there we two content happy in being together speaking little perhaps not a word

he does not think that i haunt here nightly how shall i let him know that whither his fancy sets him wandering i too alertly go hover and hover a few feet from him just as i used to do but can not answer the words he lifts me – only listen thereto when i could answer he did not say them when i could let him know how i would like to join in his journeys seldom he wished to go now that he goes and wants me with him more than he used to do never he sees my faithful phantom though he speaks thereto yes i companion him to places only dreamers know where the shy hares print long paces where the night rooks go into old aisles where the past is all to him close as his shade can do always lacking the power to call to him near as i reach thereto what a good haunter i am o tell him quickly make him know if he but sigh since my loss befell him straight to his side i go tell him a faithful one is doing all that love can do still that his path may be worth pursuing and to bring peace thereto
the legendary muscle that wants and grieves the organ of attachment the pump of thrills and troubles clinging in stubborn colonies like pulpy shore-life battened on a jetty slashed by the little deaths of sleep and pleasure they swell in the nurturing spasms of the waves sucking to cling and even in death itself— baked frozen—they shrink to grip the granite harder “ rid yourself of attachments and aversions ” — but in her father ’ s orchard already he says he ’ d like to be her bird and she says sweet yes yet i should kill thee with much cherishing showing that she knows already—as art pepper that first time he takes heroin already knows that he will go to prison and that he ’ ll suffer and knows he needs to have it or die and the one who makes the general lose the world for love lets him say would i had never seen her but oh says enobarbus then you would have missed a wonderful piece of work which left unseen would bring less glory to your travels among the creatures in the rock-torn surf a wave of agitation a gasp a scholar quips shakespeare was almost certainly homosexual bisexual or heterosexual the sonnets provide no evidence on the matter he writes romeo an extravagant speech on tears in the italian manner his teardrops cover his chamber window says the boy he calls them crystals inanely and sings them to juliet with his heart the almost certainly invented heart which buddha denounces in its endless changes forever jumping and moving like an ape over the poor beast ’ s head the crystal fountain crashes illusions the cold salt spume of pain and meaningless distinction as buddha says but here in the crystal shower mouths are open to sing it is lee andrews and the hearts in 1957 singing i sit in my room looking out at the rain my tear drops are like crystals they cover my windowpane the turns of these illusions we make become their glory to buddha every distinct thing is illusion and becoming is destruction but still we sing in the shower i do in the beginning god drenched the emptiness with images the potter crosslegged at his wheel in benares market making mud cups another cup each second tapering up between his fingers one more to sell the tea-seller at a penny a dozen and tea a penny a cup the customers smash the empties and waves of traffic grind the shards to mud for new cups in turn and i keep one here next to me holding it awhile from out of the cloud of dust that rises from the shattered pieces the risen dust alive with fire then settled and soaked and whirling again on the wheel that turns and looks on the world as on another cloud on everything the heart can grasp and throw away as a passing cloud with even enlightenment itself another image another cloud to break and churn a salt foam over the heart like an anemone that sucks at clouds and makes itself with clouds and sings in clouds and covers its windowpane with clouds that blur and melt until one clings and holds—as once in the temple in the time before the temple was destroyed a young priest saw the seraphim of the lord each had six wings with two they covered their faces with two they covered their legs and feet with two they darted and hovered like dragonflies or perched like griffins in the shadows near the ceiling— these are the visions too barbarous for heaven and too preposterous for belief on earth god sends to taunt his prophet with the truth no one can see that leads to who knows where a seraph took a live coal from the altar and seared the prophet ’ s lips and so he spoke as the record ends a coda in retard the hearts in a shifting velvety ah and ah prolonged again and again as lee andrews reaches ah high for i have to gain faith hope and charity god only knows the girl who will love me—oh if we only could start over again then the hearts chant the chords again a final time ah and the record turns through all the music and on into silence again

mistress adrienne i have been given a bed with a pink dresser in the hothouse joining the concord public library the walls and roof are glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums violets ferns marigolds and white mayflags i get my meals with the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine to use i scour sweep and dust i hope you don ’ t think of me as a runaway i remember your kindness your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza my journey was unusual i saw some of the war and it was terrible even far up into the north my first fright was at a train depot outside memphis where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened quinces and grapes they took me prisoner first i helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox of the locomotive then i was shown to a gentleman in the passenger car who was searching for his runaway negress in a purple dress he wouldn ’ t identify me and i was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into an open boxcar and soon we were moving next to me a man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl maybe twelve years of age across from them a sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end by afternoon she was dead her two friends just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket the girl next to me whimpered and shook those quinces just ran straight through me and all i could do was squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters and hay we were given that night confederate uniforms to mend and when the others slept i dressed in three shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train the padding helped some but i couldn ’ t walk the next day i hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock of turkeys some young hens and a corncrib with tall split palings the next morning from a hill i watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation it took two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from a battle scene that night i found a horse with a bit in its mouth made of telegraph wire he carried me up all the way to youngstown chloe you must learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel i am grateful i had to swim two rivers i fished some for perch bream and trout and ate dried berries i stole a bushel of oysters from the porch of a farmhouse i treated my sores with blackgum from poplars i witnessed the hanging of three confederate soldiers at a trestle once they were done dancing they settled in their greatcoats like dead folded birds i have a hatred of men and i walked away from the trestle singing i spoke to the concord literary club last tuesday about my experiences i told them you never did abuse me how we would sit out in the gazebo and listen to the boys with their violins tambourines bones drums and sticks how we wept as girls when the fox bit the head off our peahen and that from that day how the peacock missing his mate would see her in his reflection in a downstairs window and fly at it increasing his iridescence with lacerations when i left you the windows were all missing and daubers were making their mud houses in the high corners of the hallway with sugar-water and crepe i have put a new hem on my purple dress at night i walk down the aisles of the library the books climb twenty feet above me i just walk there naked with my tiny lamp i have the need to fling the lamp sometimes but i resist it mistress adrienne i saw three big cities burning did you know ladies from philadelphia rode for two days in wagons to climb a hill where with spyglasses they watched the war like a horse-pulling contest at a fair the man beside me on the train who was sucking the little girl ’ s breasts he was your stable boy napoleon he said he never had a bad word for you his little mistress was still bare to the waist and before i leapt from the train and while he slept i ran a rod into his eye i stabbed him in his brain she stopped weeping remember that french lullaby where two fleas in a gentleman ’ s mustache die like a kiss between the lips of the gentleman and his mistress how we laughed at it i hope you were not long unconscious there beside the pond i just ran away from you listening the whole night for your father ’ s hounds i am afraid i split your parasol on your skull if i don ’ t hear from you i will try to understand chloe
the dog licks my hand as i worry about the left nipple of the woman in the bathroom she is drying her hair the woman whose left nipple is sore we looked this evening for diagonal cuts or discoloration or bite marks from small insects that may be in our bed it is a good bed a faithful bed a bed that won ’ t be hurt by the consideration we gave to the possibility of small though disproportionately strong insects in our bed the blow-dryer sounds like a jet taking off the first time i flew to brussels people began the journey happy but ended with drool on their shirts she is drying her hair though she has never been to brussels drying her hair though she could be petting a dog drying her hair while having red thoughts about what the pain in her nipple means i would not dry my hair in such a moment but i am bald the body of the woman has many ways to cease being the body of the woman i have one way to be happy and she is that way i would like to fly with her to brussels we would not be put off by the drool this is what happens when people sleep we would buy postcards of the little boy who saved brussels when he peed on a fire we would be romantic in public places for the moment these desires can best be furthered by petting a dog i ’ m also working on this theory that sometimes a part of the body just hurts that the purpose of prayer is to make the part of the body that sometimes just hurts the little toe or appendix something vestigial or redundant something that can be jettisoned i have no reason to use the word cancer while petting a dog here is a piece of a second during which a jet is not flying nor is it on the ground i ’ m working on a theory that no one can die inside that piece of a second if you are comforted by this thought you are welcome to keep it
it lies not in our power to love or hate for will in us is overruled by fate when two are stripped long ere the course begin we wish that one should lose the other win and one especially do we affect of two gold ingots like in each respect the reason no man knows let it suffice what we behold is censured by our eyes where both deliberate the love is slight who ever loved that loved not at first sight
or will we be lost forever in the silence of the last breath not taken the blue sweep of your arm like a dancer clowning in wrinkled pajamas across the sky the abrupt brief zigzag of a jay ... all night the whiteness and all day once we have been lifted up into empty morning like ice in the darkness of these white fields neither the ghost tracks of skis nor steel skates will wake us where are we looking for each other separated on the opposite hillside i see you miles away from me a dot of faint color reddening small bruised warmth opening its cranberry mouth and saying what are you saying under a cold blanket an immense loneliness stretches in every direction with no fences a few sticks tweak the crusted snow thin remnants of an army of lost soldiers i see footsteps ahead of me but whose and where will they lead me parallel or converging is it not possible there will be one jet trail that will not vanish two phantom ribbons unfolding that will not feather themselves away wrapped in our white parkas in what shifting laminations snowflakes that mean nothing transparent eyes spitting what glacier will we choose to lie on in what igloo rest barely breathing in an air pocket just below the surface rustling beneath blizzards where is your foot most beautiful with blue toenails i will be looking for it always wherever it is next to me in the darkness of rumpled white sheets pale siftings clouds sudden scarves of ourselves gusting loose sandpapery as snow lifting in what chill citadel of ice crystals will i find you

they are a gift i have wanted again wanted one moment in mountains when winter got so cold the oil froze before it could burn i chopped ferns of hoarfrost from all the windows and peered up at pines a wedding cake by a baker gone mad swirls by the thousand shimmered above me until a cloud lumbered over a ridge bringing the heavier white of more flurries i believed i believed i believed it would last that when you went out to test the black ice or to dig out a volkswagon filled with rich women you ’ d return and we ’ d sputter like oil match after match warm in the making wisconsin ’ s flat farmland never approved i hid in cornfields far into october listening to music that whirled from my thumbprint when sunset played havoc with bright leaves of alders i never mentioned longing or fear i crouched like a good refugee in brown creeks and forgot why autumn is harder than spring but snug on the western slope of that mountain i ’ d accept every terror break open seals to release love ’ s headwaters to unhurried sunlight weren ’ t we big hearts through some trick of silver we held one another believing each motion the real one ah lover why were dark sources bundled up in our eyes each owned an agate marbled with anguish a heart or its echo we hardly knew lips touching lips did that break my horizon as much as those horses broke my belief you drove off and i walked the old road scolding the doubles that wanted so much the chestnut mare whinnied a cloud into scrub pine in a windless corner of a corral four horses fit like puzzle pieces their dark eyes and lashes defined by the white the colt kicked his hind loped from the fence the mares and a stallion galloped behind lifting and leaping finding each other in full accord with the earth and their bodies no harm ever touched them once they cut loose snorting at flurries falling again how little our chances for feeling ourselves they vanished so quickly—one flick of a tail where do their mountains and moments begin i stood a long time in sharpening wind
for john i couldn ’ t see in this light even if i wished the black grillwork over black cool upon coal kisses me back in an icy press not wanting—anything—but to fall as the empty trash cans mingle below with the smell of feral cats flailing moon the color of suds over this factory of artifice moored in the poverty of my untouched element downed like a dog struck by a diesel—one headlamp flaring before my shadow ’ s dust buries its past in a crescent of mirth lost now in this anonymity of barely knowing you my body would go unsearched for in the rubble who could remember my odor my perfect strangeness at a glance life leaves through the gate of an ache where you are a vanishing landscape do i dare it back i don ’ t know where you go anymore when you escape into that vast wilderness of our legal separation your memory rises from the knocking pipes a sudden heat a blast of blood where does it go the galloping horses i hear are not hooves but my heart kicking in its swollen stall but you you take things as a letting go like a beacon that opens a lens cap to our past you take off the dark like this snow-strewn alley a radiance but no light of mine jealous as an abandoned child i had no word for father it floated in heaven like friend or famine it rose like a muscle and punctuated my dreams the ones of ruined houses of countries like this one where the faces of whores and the working poor are my own you had irish eyes the color of old ice what you lost was first love and a word for forever like evergreen oceanic fossil my bones could grind themselves to salt and i would still be this aging woman this battered lifeline history never has been kind to a loser what do i see when morning chops ice into jade what ring could i trade now for the freedom to bleed what would i remember of a hearth where the flags of my silks beat at half mast where i studied a sure vocabulary of snow i had to leave before i could hear it the sound of dishwater in a steamed house the singing of water on white porcelain cooling like clots seeping through a wound our collision of tensions a viscous rendered fat divorced releasing
what of her glass without her the blank gray there where the pool is blind of the moon ’ s face her dress without her the tossed empty space of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away her paths without her day ’ s appointed sway usurped by desolate night her pillowed place without her tears ah me for love ’ s good grace and cold forgetfulness of night or day what of the heart without her nay poor heart of thee what word remains ere speech be still a wayfarer by barren ways and chill steep ways and weary without her thou art where the long cloud the long wood ’ s counterpart sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill

she could tell he loved her he wanted her there sitting in the front pew when he preached he liked to watch her putting up her hair and ate whatever she cooked and never broached the subject of the years before they met he was thoughtful always he let her say whether or not they did anything in bed and tried to learn the games she tried to play she could tell how deep his feeling ran he liked to say her name and bought her stuff for no good reason he was a gentle man how few there are she knew well enough he sometimes reached to flick away a speck of something on her clothes and didn ’ t drum his fingers on the table when she spoke what would he do if he knew she had a dream sometimes slipping out of her nightgown— if ever god forbid he really knew her— to slip once out of the house and across town and find someone to talk dirty to her

in golden gate park that day a man and his wife were coming along thru the enormous meadow which was the meadow of the world he was wearing green suspenders and carrying an old beat-up flute in one hand while his wife had a bunch of grapes which she kept handing out individually to various squirrels as if each were a little joke and then the two of them came on thru the enormous meadow which was the meadow of the world and then at a very still spot where the trees dreamed and seemed to have been waiting thru all time for them they sat down together on the grass without looking at each other and ate oranges without looking at each other and put the peels in a basket which they seemed to have brought for that purpose without looking at each other and then he took his shirt and undershirt off but kept his hat on sideways and without saying anything fell asleep under it and his wife just sat there looking at the birds which flew about calling to each other in the stilly air as if they were questioning existence or trying to recall something forgotten but then finally she too lay down flat and just lay there looking up at nothing yet fingering the old flute which nobody played and finally looking over at him without any particular expression except a certain awful look of terrible depression

they have shown her facing from a range of barley at times and from the patio she wrings a sprig of mint in a walled garden behold the dimple that none reckoned on careless burdens of plums of parsley i thank those gentlemen many an old master is needed if there shall be love i thank velasquez more for a woman turned away may be imposed without disparagement in a prospect of grandeur where this high cliff joins the deep sunlight i see you beside me spread aside in the buoyant deer-moss i sit cross-legged nibbling juniper berries and i call you my louella now now ella lou far down from one rim is the bay with flocks of teal and we might look down shafts of cedar the other way i feel a privileged one who waits remembering the special pleasure of youth is of self-denial since velasquez and the masters have hexed my eyes i see you now even in this northern grandeur following the hip i watch the flank ’ s retirement and watch the nape declining from the crescent shoulder but where your shoulder ripples back to fill the arm is a slight plump area probably nameless in all but rarest postures that form vanishes into wherever you withdraw inopportune breaths you might not wonder it is there i stretching forward beseeching you be motionless hold the wide kiss i wonder mightily for my part for what purpose have i stretched a thousand miles between the two of us

he described her mouth as full of ashes so when he kissed her finally he was thinking about ashes and the blacker rim just below the edge of the ashtray and the faint dark rim that outlined her lips and the lips themselves at the limit of another darkness farther and far more interior then the way the red paling just outside those lines caught fire and the pages caught soon after that slowly at first but then all at once at the scalloped brown corners of each like the ruff of an offended and darkening bird extended then folded in on itself multiple stiffening gone

for susan koethe this is the life i wanted and could never see for almost twenty years i thought that it was enough that real happiness was either unreal or lost or endless and that remembrance was as close to it as i could ever come and i believed that deep in the past buried in my heart beyond the depth of sight there was a kingdom of peace and so i never imagined that when peace would finally come it would be on a summer evening a few blocks away from home in a small suburban park with some children playing aimlessly in an endless light and a lake shining in the distance eventually sometime around the middle of your life there ’ s a moment when the first imagination begins to wane the future that had always seemed so limitless dissolves and the dreams that used to seem so real float up and fade the years accumulate but they start to take on a mild human tone beyond imagination like the sound the heart makes pouring into the past its hymns of adoration and regret and then gradually the moments quicken into life vibrant with possibility sovereign dense serene and then the park is empty and the years are still i think the saddest memory is of a kind of light a kind of twilight that seemed to permeate the air for a few years after i ’ d grown up and gone away from home it was limitless and free and of course i was going to change but freedom means that only aspects ever really change and that as the past recedes and the future floats away you turn into what you are and so i stayed basically the same as what i ’ d always been while the blond light in the trees became part of my memory and my voice took on the accents of a mind infatuated with the rhetoric of farewell and now that disembodied grief has gone away it was a flickering literary kind of sadness the suspension of a life between two other lives of continual remembrance between two worlds in which there ’ s too much solitude too much disdain but the sadness that i felt was real sadness and this elation now a real tremor as the deepening shadows lengthen upon the lake this calm is real but how much of the real past can it absorb how far into the future can this peace extend i love the way the light falls over the suburbs late on these summer evenings as the buried minds stir in their graves the hearts swell in the warm earth and the soul settles from the air into its human home this is where the prodigal began and now his day is ending in a great dream of contentment where all night long the children sleep within tomorrow ’ s peaceful arms and the past is still and suddenly we turn around and smile at the memory of a vast inchoate dream of happiness now that we know that none of it is ever going to be don ’ t you remember how free the future seemed when it was all imagination it was a beautiful park where the sky was a page of water and when we looked up there were our own faces shimmering in the clear air and i know that this life is the only real form of happiness but sometimes in its midst i can hear the dense stifled sob of the unreal one we might have known and when that ends and my eyes are filled with tears time seems to have stopped and we are alone in the park where it is almost twenty years ago and the future is still an immense open dream

“ where is the poet šťastný or professor batĕk or mrs. marie jungova now gone all gone those who took part that wild summer night forty-five years ago ” kamila reads romances “ there ’ s no love just

stone falling into water— ” “ you ’ re the star i look for in evening— ” “ i was your shadow— ” “ even thoughts become flesh— ” in the fountain bubbling up among the lime tree roots mumbling its prayers over and over tonguing the stones now after the war no need for bread butter eggs semolina flour geese delivered by special connection and czechoslovakia is free in the sinfonietta in the

of her shadowed brow his baby son died those years ago and olga ’ s hair spreads wide across the pillow where she sighs he sleeps alone it ’ s like a stone falling lullaby bee swarms gut scraping fracture a waltz falters the schmaltzy tune with raven hair whispers breaks off and the hand she lets him touch for the first time she does not draw away the first time “ your little hand ” in eleven years under the linden boughs “ that dark jewess ” writes zdenka “ i rather liked her at first but i held my position you know how artists are they have to be handled i would not let him go. ” “ these letters were written in fire. ” zdenka must understand kamila is the gypsy girl káťa kabanová the vixen aljeja the little hidden well by the lime trees at kazničov the military fanfare on the promenade trumpet oboe piccolo squeal when the austrians march out the empire crashes and the country is like the high-wire flute notes finally free zdenka must acknowledge this these letters were written in fire by now kamila ’ s boys have been stuffed into trousers stiff collars and neckties they ’ ve grown leggy their faces are plump it ’ s a question of tempi slightly retarded a vertigo the viola suffers following the violins silence goes to sleep under every tree the cello drags gusts of confetti repetition emotion is all repetition pulled by twisted horsehair out of gut my dear dark dove a form of mourning that too is a form of repetition why don ’ t you write so when those last days she has come at last with little otto respectably to visit the upstairs room he has built and furnished for her in his summer cottage in hukvaldy furnished according to his dream— “ i want to have the painting of those two cherubs a writing desk a communal table a comfortable bed perhaps of brass a wardrobe with mirrored doors a marble wash-stand and four chairs each from a different part of the world— ” the question is what can be assimilated into song she peels oranges makes tea they shop in the market and play and walk and august 8 on the walk up the babí hůra hill otto gets lost in the woods and ravines— something gets lost so well no one can find it— and leoš seeks and seeks the child in drenching rain as if searching for his own son in the woods and ravines under the wing of her darkly tilting brow and returns fevered in a notebook no one writes no one scores his cough 10 august 1928 j consents to go to the hospital in ostrava pneumonia—deterioration—sedative what walks we took on the corso something gets lost so well so it ’ s like a stone silence goes to sleep under every tree i was your shadow i burned your letters but i keep the ash no one scored the sleep rattle in ostrava 12 august 10 a.m. sunday kamila at his side a heavy woman who spells poorly broad in the beam with thick knees and white stockings who reads romances who will die of cancer seven years later at 43 and be buried in the jewish cemetery in písek “ and i kissed you and you are sitting beside me and i am happy and at peace in such a way do the days pass for the angels. ” no one scored the sleep rattle sunday 12 august only then by his order zdenka is told and arrives by train these letters were written in fire

what more can man desire always he woke in those days with a sense of treasure his heart a gayer glow than his window grand with sun as a child its mind all whirring with green and hollied pleasure wakes in a haze of christmas the season of secrets done or as one on country linen wakes with a start one morning— then on comfort snugger than pillows floats july at the lake or has married a golden girl and can hardly believe but turning sees blossom for him that very face worshipping cameras take toy trains whirr perky on till springs contort beneath the middle-age rower slumps like a sack—indignant seizure late editions wail screen star in mystery death— yet in those same days he woke with a sense of treasure knowing my love is safe though the rockies plunge like water though surf like a wildfire rage and omens roam the sky though limbs of the swimmer laze pale where the seaweed caught her nothing can touch my love as dangerous time goes by

i dream of jeanie with the light brown hair borne like a vapor on the summer air i see her tripping where the bright streams play happy as the daisies that dance on her way many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour many were the blithe birds that warbled them o ’ er oh i dream of jeanie with the light brown hair floating like a vapor on the soft summer air i long for jeanie with the daydawn smile radiant in gladness warm with winning guile i hear her melodies like joys gone by sighing round my heart o ’ er the fond hopes that die — sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain — wailing for the lost one that comes not again oh i long for jeanie and my heart bows low never more to find her where the bright waters flow i sigh for jeanie but her light form strayed far from the fond hearts round her native glade her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore while her gentle fingers will cull them no more oh i sigh for jeanie with the light brown hair floating like a vapor on the soft summer air

when beauty breaks and falls asunder i feel no grief for it but wonder when love like a frail shell lies broken i keep no chip of it for token i never had a man for friend who did not know that love must end i never had a girl for lover who could discern when love was over what the wise doubt the fool believes— who is it then that love deceives
it may be through some foreign grace and unfamiliar charm of face it may be that across the foam which bore her from her childhood ’ s home by some strange spell my katie brought along with english creeds and thought— entangled in her golden hair— some english sunshine warmth and air i can not tell—but here to-day a thousand billowy leagues away from that green isle whose twilight skies no darker are than katie ’ s eyes she seems to me go where she will an english girl in england still i meet her on the dusty street and daisies spring about her feet or touched to life beneath her tread an english cowslip lifts its head and as to do her grace rise up the primrose and the buttercup i roam with her through fields of cane and seem to stroll an english lane which white with blossoms of the may spreads its green carpet in her way as fancy wills the path beneath is golden gorse or purple heath and now we hear in woodlands dim their unarticulated hymn now walk through rippling waves of wheat now sink in mats of clover sweet or see before us from the lawn the lark go up to greet the dawn all birds that love the english sky throng round my path when she is by the blackbird from a neighboring thorn with music brims the cup of morn and in a thick melodious rain the mavis pours her mellow strain but only when my katie ’ s voice makes all the listening woods rejoice i hear—with cheeks that flush and pale— the passion of the nightingale anon the pictures round her change and through an ancient town we range whereto the shadowy memory clings of one of england ’ s saxon kings and which to shrine his fading fame still keeps his ashes and his name quaint houses rise on either hand but still the airs are fresh and bland as if their gentle wings caressed some new-born village of the west a moment by the norman tower we pause it is the sabbath hour and o ’ er the city sinks and swells the chime of old st. mary ’ s bells which still resound in katie ’ s ears as sweet as when in distant years she heard them peal with jocund din a merry english christmas in we pass the abbey ’ s ruined arch and statelier grows my katie ’ s march as round her wearied with the taint of transatlantic pine and paint she sees a thousand tokens cast of england ’ s venerable past our reverent footsteps lastly claims the younger chapel of st. james which though as english records run not old had seen full many a sun ere to the cold december gale the sullen pilgrim spread his sail there katie in her childish days spelt out her prayers and lisped her praise and doubtless as her beauty grew did much as other maidens do— across the pews and down the aisle sent many a beau-bewildering smile and to subserve her spirit ’ s need learned other things beside the creed there too to-day her knee she bows and by her one whose darker brows betray the southern heart that burns beside her and which only turns its thoughts to heaven in one request not all unworthy to be blest but rising from an earthlier pain than might beseem a christian fane ah can the guileless maiden share the wish that lifts that passionate prayer is all at peace that breast within good angels warn her of the sin alas what boots it who can save a willing victim of the wave who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt or gather wine when wine is spilt we quit the holy house and gain the open air then happy twain adown familiar streets we go and now and then she turns to show with fears that all is changing fast some spot that ’ s sacred to her past here by this way through shadows cool a little maid she tripped to school and there each morning used to stop before a wonder of a shop where built of apples and of pears rose pyramids of golden spheres while dangling in her dazzled sight ripe cherries cast a crimson light and made her think of elfin lamps and feast and sport in fairy camps whereat upon her royal throne most richly carved in cherry-stone titania ruled in queenly state the boisterous revels of the fête ’ t was yonder with their “ horrid ” noise dismissed from books she met the boys who with a barbarous scorn of girls glanced slightly at her sunny curls and laughed and leaped as reckless by as though no pretty face were nigh but—here the maiden grows demure— indeed she ’ s not so very sure that in a year or haply twain few looked who failed to look again and sooth to say i little doubt some azure day the truth will out that certain baits in certain eyes caught many an unsuspecting prize and somewhere underneath these eaves a budding flirt put forth its leaves has not the sky a deeper blue have not the trees a greener hue and bend they not with lordlier grace and nobler shapes above the place where on one cloudless winter morn my katie to this life was born ah folly long hath fled the hour when love to sight gave keener power and lovers looked for special boons in brighter flowers and larger moons but wave the foliage as it may and let the sky be ashen gray thus much at least a manly youth may hold—and yet not blush—as truth if near that blessed spot of earth which saw the cherished maiden ’ s birth no softer dews than usual rise and life there keeps its wonted guise yet not the less that spot may seem as lovely as a poet ’ s dream and should a fervid faith incline to make thereof a sainted shrine who may deny that round us throng a hundred earthly creeds as wrong but meaner far which yet unblamed stalk by us and are not ashamed so therefore katie as our stroll ends at this portal while you roll those lustrous eyes to catch each ray that may recall some vanished day i—let them jeer and laugh who will— stoop down and kiss the sacred sill so strongly sometimes on the sense these fancies hold their influence that in long well-known streets i stray like one who fears to lose his way the stranger i the native she myself not kate have crossed the sea and changing place and mixing times i walk in unfamiliar climes these houses free to every breeze that blows from warm floridian seas assume a massive english air and close around an english square while if i issue from the town an english hill looks greenly down or round me rolls an english park and in the broad i hear the larke thus when where woodland violets hide i rove with katie at my side it scarce would seem amiss to say “ katie my home lies far away beyond the pathless waste of brine in a young land of palm and pine there by the tropic heats the soul is touched as if with living coal and glows with such a fire as none can feel beneath a northern sun unless—my katie ’ s heart attest — ’ t is kindled in an english breast such is the land in which i live and katie such the soul i give come ere another morning beam we ’ ll cleave the sea with wings of steam and soon despite of storm or calm beneath my native groves of palm kind friends shall greet with joy and pride the southron and his english bride ”

from the fire-worshippers “ how sweetly ” said the trembling maid of her own gentle voice afraid so long had they in silence stood looking upon that tranquil flood— “ how sweetly does the moon-beam smile to-night upon yon leafy isle oft in my fancy ’ s wanderings i ’ ve wish ’ d that little isle had wings and we within its fairy bow ’ rs were wafted off to seas unknown where not a pulse should beat but ours and we might live love die alone far from the cruel and the cold — where the bright eyes of angels only should come around us to behold a paradise so pure and lonely would this be world enough for thee ” — playful she turn ’ d that he might see the passing smile her cheek put on but when she mark ’ d how mournfully his eyes met hers that smile was gone and bursting into heart-felt tears “ yes yes ” she cried “ my hourly fears my dreams have boded all too right— we part—for ever part—to-night i knew i knew it could not last— ’ twas bright ’ twas heav ’ nly but ’ tis past oh ever thus from childhood ’ s hour i ’ ve seen my fondest hopes decay i never lov ’ d a tree or flow ’ r but ’ twas the first to fade away i never nurs ’ d a dear gazelle to glad me with its soft black eye but when it came to know me well and love me it was sure to die now too—the joy most like divine of all i ever dreamt or knew to see thee hear thee call thee mine — oh misery must i lose that too yet go—on peril ’ s brink we meet — those frightful rocks—that treach ’ rous sea— no never come again—though sweet though heav ’ n it may be death to thee farewell—and blessings on thy way where ’ er thou goest beloved stranger better to sit and watch that ray and think thee safe though far away than have thee near me and in danger ”

reading in the paper a summary of a five-year psychological study that shows those perceived as most beautiful are treated differently i think they could have just asked me remembering a kind of pudgy kid and late puberty the bloody noses and wisecracks because i wore glasses though we all know by now how awful it is for the busty starlet no one takes seriously the loveliest women i ’ ve lunched with lamenting the opacity of the body they can never trust a man ’ s interest even when he seems not just out for sex eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass and who would want to live like this and what does beauty do to a man — don juan casanova lord byron— those fiery eyes and steel jawlines can front a furnace of self-loathing all those breathless women rushing to him while hubby ’ s at the office or ball game primed to be consumed by his beauty while he stands next to it watching so maybe the looks we ’ re dealt are best it ’ s only common sense that happiness depends on some bearable deprivation or defect and who knows what conflicts great beauty could have caused what cruelties one might have suffered from those now friends what unmanageable possibilities smiling at every small turn so if i get up to draw a tumbler of ordinary tap water and think what if this were nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers will all i ’ ve missed knock me senseless no of course not it won ’ t
the unsigned architecture of loneliness is becoming taller finding a way farther above the horizontal flowering of the cold war the peonies and star asters of wild partisanship i have a shambling gait and lonely hysteria but no terror i am free to shamble past the vacant lot of my son ’ s conception to shamble past the bar where i conceived adultery as a terror that would be endless flowering in great waves through air striated like chenille i walk for a long time and try to conjure elsewhere in its early isolation i can not it is all redestinated by the future like the loose balloons a janitor recovers at 6 am from cold light fixtures the cold war is ending buildings are taller and have no names 1. the romance of every ideology torments the romance of another how beautifully in the beginning in the gale and embrace of isolation boys capered over a shambles and swore oaths the scent of urine in the hall at home was righteousness the beautiful nude obscured by dust in a paperweight was righteousness neglectful townships coming into steep flower just as boys were flowering needed the correction of righteousness the horizontal slag of government by children only the insane allegiances endure the mad counterparts are lovers passion can not explain nor circumstances restrict to the dead zones of irony a counterpart of end of the cold war is adultery a counterpart of loving a divided berlin unto death is fatherhood the doting maintenance of sons in vacant lots continuing the wars of rubble for righteousness ’ sake and for the sake of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity romance torments romance the most beautiful moment of the twentieth century galed and embraced the acrid smoky air as the red army entered berlin as hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire as red army flags opened above berlin safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future townships blackened even as they flowered loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun i walked for a long time and tried to conjure the form of kindness it was a domestic animal confused in the tall grass boys set fire to the grass history that opens flags opened the fire and berlin divided from berlin began to love its children past all reason 2. my son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls he starves the ground he walks on preparing a dead city to be worthy of its new flags to shine as exploded windows shine raining down for hours after the wrecking crews have gone i have a lover now who hates children the hatred floats inside of her a weightless sexual pavilion of perfect form and perfect emptiness i thought by making love to her i would conceive nothing but terror outrage upon outrage a violence that would last my whole life and free my son i was ignorant as a balloon across the luminous expressway i see the shapes of charred tenements castellated fading into the more tender shapes of night it may be the last night in history tomorrow pulls down the berlin wall pulls down my honor and i return to my lover ’ s bed to float in a white condom no longer my son ’ s father tomorrow describes everything in detail it explains nothing it does not teach my boy that tenements are better than the future better that peace more likely to produce brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings without end or walls denuded of their wire in the dead zone of irony before dawn only the cats cry like martyrs in the flame 3. gates everywhere the brandenburg the great gate of kiev beneath which children stride onto an invisible crescendo disappearing into gasoline fires emerging as the new shapes of righteousness in slow vans through the brandenburg gate oaths are secret because none suspects that they are kept they thrust themselves towards us unashamedly like the insane homeless and we do not see them in our loneliness we see a chance for love in betrayal not death in our loneliness we see the happy triumph of glassy hands in free elections not the denuding of berlin or wanderings of children in vans reduced by fire to black transparencies in the morning shade when joan of arc surrendered to the flames she cried out “ jesus jesus. ” some years later a failed magician who had loved her cried out “ joan joan ” as the flames mocked him with a sortilege too easy to be unreal or profitable i walk for a long time and try to conjure the form of loneliness without cold war it is ash upon ash a chiaroscuro aloft and on the ground completely still oaths are secret because none suspects the desperation of every object the child in every atom of the misused world thrust towards us crying out whatever sacred name it witnessed put to death on the ascending music of a wall our buildings are tall and have no names the parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers 4. afterwards the calm is piteous but insubstantial as a smell of burn that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire imagine walking out of a house at sunrise and having to invent air invent light from nothing but untriggered memory all things beloved are recalled to pain air recollected from the wrists of girls braceleted for confirmation crossed light recollected from between the cars of night trains in a deep river valley where islands in the river glowed like swans air recollected form a ditch in flower light recollected from the sex of flowers in bare rooms the grainy light of blondes air recollected from religion light recollected form the incensed clutch of bodies before sunrise in the oaths of a great and ignorant lost cause imagine walking out of a house at sunrise having spent the night in bed with a stranger aloft and on the ground the calm unfurls like flags without device or slogan the inconsequence of the day ahead stirs airless atmospheres in darkness visible as daylight but without shade without cold war without the arbitrary demarcation of cause from cause of light and air from the unsexed improvisations of memory i can not see to walk or breathe to breathe sex becomes applause sex becomes television and the bastard avant garde of lonely architecture breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city that marks the capital of nothing now 5. a scratchy recorded call to prayer crosses the alley from one new building into mine the consolations of history are furtive then fugitive then forgotten like a bar of music that might have been obscene or sacred once in another city in the days before today my son is well he works the public ground and needs no antigone my lover sits beside him at dinner sharing a joke unmapping the tall future and its unbiased children reinventing the sexual pavilion to accommodate plague wards romance forgives romance the early isolation of this gorgeous century disappears into good works the future is best to put a final stop to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom and to the ruinous armies of mad boys whose government is rape whose justice is a wall revoke all partisanship adjourn the terror the future is best it unobscures the dusty nudes it protects the river islands and their glowing swans but when i need to die who will light the fire what names shall i cry out and what music burn to a black transparency in my heart the unborn have been revoked they will not be kind
“ the experience of truth is indispensible for the experience of beauty and the sense of beauty is guided by a leap in the dark. ” arthur koestler i. stoplights edged the licorice street with ribbon neon embroidering wet sidewalks she turned into the driveway and leaped in the dark a blackbird perched on the bouncing twig of a maple heard her whisper “ stranger lover the lost days are over while i walk from car to door something inward opens like four o ’ clocks in rain earth cold from autumn pulls me i can ’ t breathe the same with dirt for marrow and mist for skin blurring my vision my vision ’ s separate self i stand drunk in this glitter under the sky ’ s grey shelter the city maple not half so bitter hurls itself in two directions until both tips darken and disappear as i darken my reflection in the smoking mirror of my home how faint the sound of dry leaves like the clattering keys of another morning another world. ” ii she looked out the window at some inward greying door the maple held her glance made ground fog from her cigarette beyond uneven stairs children screamed gunned each other down then she sealed her nimble dreams with water from a murky bay “ for him i map this galaxy of dust that turns without an answer when it rains i remember his face in the corridor of a past apartment and trace the anguish around his mouth his wrinkled forehead unguarded eyes the foreign fruit of an intricate sadness with the grace that remains i catch a glint around a door i can not enter the clock echoes in dishtowels i search love ’ s center and bang pans against the rubble of my day the lucid grandeur of wet ground the strangeness of a fatal sun that makes us mark on the margin of our loss trust in the gossamer of touch trust in the late-plowed field. ” iii when the sun opened clouds and walked into her mongrel soul she chopped celery into rocky remnants of the sea and heard fat sing up bread a better dying the magnet in each seed of the green pepper kept her flying floating toward memories that throb like clustered stars the dark water laughter of ducks a tangle of november oaks toward sudden music on a wheel of brilliant dust where like a moon she must leap back and forth from emptiness “ i remember the moon shimmering loss and discovery along a water edge and skirting a slice of carrot i welcome eternity in that sad eye of autumn rare and real i dance while vegetables sing in pairs i hug my death my chorus of years and search and stretch and leap for i will be apprentice to the blood in spite of the mood of a world that keeps rusting rusting the wild throats of birds. ” iv in lamplight she saw the smoke of another ’ s dream her daughter walk woods where snow weighs down pine her son cry on a bridge that ends in deep-rooted dark her man stalled on a lonely road realize his torque was alcohol and hatred “ hungry for silence i listen to wind to the sound of water running down mountain my own raw breath between the sounds a seaborn god plays his reed in the caverns of my being i wear his amethyst let go my dreams millars lacewings and junebugs scatter widen and batter the dark brightening this loud dust with the fever of their eyes oh crazy itch that grabs us beyond loss and lets us forgive so that we can answer birds and deer lightning and rain shadow and hurricane truth waits in the creek cutting the winter brown hills it sings with needles of ice sings because of its scar ”
i do not know where either of us can turn just at first waking from the sleep of each other i do not know how we can bear the river struck by the gold plummet of the moon or many trees shaken together in the darkness we shall wish not to be alone and that love were not dispersed and set free— though you defeat me and i be heavy upon you but like earth heaped over the heart is love grown perfect like a shell over the beat of life is love perfect to the last so let it be the same whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another let us know this for leavetaking that i may not be heavy upon you that you may blind me no more
this to the crown and blessing of my life the much loved husband of a happy wife to him whose constant passion found the art to win a stubborn and ungrateful heart and to the world by tenderest proof discovers they err who say that husbands can ’ t be lovers with such return of passion as is due daphnis i love daphnis my thoughts pursue daphnis my hopes and joys are bounded all in you even i for daphnis ’ and my promise ’ sake what i in women censure undertake but this from love not vanity proceeds you know who writes and i who ’ tis that reads judge not my passion by my want of skill many love well though they express it ill and i your censure could with pleasure bear would you but soon return and speak it here
my head my heart mine eyes my life nay more my joy my magazine of earthly store if two be one as surely thou and i how stayest thou there whilst i at ipswich lye so many steps head from the heart to sever if but a neck soon should we be together i like the earth this season mourn in black my sun is gone so far in ’ s zodiack whom whilst i ’ joy ’ d nor storms nor frosts i felt his warmth such frigid colds did cause to melt my chilled limbs now nummed lye forlorn return return sweet sol from capricorn in this dead time alas what can i more then view those fruits which through thy heat i bore which sweet contentment yield me for a space true living pictures of their fathers face o strange effect now thou art southward gone i weary grow the tedious day so long but when thou northward to me shalt return i wish my sun may never set but burn within the cancer of my glowing breast the welcome house of him my dearest guest where ever ever stay and go not thence till natures sad decree shall call thee hence flesh of thy flesh bone of thy bone i here thou there yet both but one
she stands beside me stands away the vague indifference of her dreams dreaming to go on and go on there like animals fleeing the rise of the earth but standing intangible my lust a worked anger a sweating close covering for the crudely salty soul then back off and where you go box of words and pictures steel balloons tied to our mouths the room fills up and the house street tilts city slides and buildings slide into the river what is there left to destroy that is not close or closer leaning away in the angle of language pumping and pumping all our eyes criss cross and flash it is the lovers pulling down empty structures they wait and touch and watch their dreams eat the morning
1 as she grows to twelve her body begins its spring its hike along the trail in the mountains that open suddenly to show a whole valley so surprising one forgets for the moment to breathe her hips and so her walk her breasts and so the way she begins to see how other people look at her how they are caught mid-breath and shy but the day a train first came here they look at her like that no one staring at her face no one noting a moustache curling up like the arms of the bald he-man posing in the traveling circus there on the face of the engineer she gets angry steam in her head the way the engine had barely held in almost bursting angry in the manner that a person might take an egg and hold it too hard her breasts begin to grow and she gets angry or she gets angry so her breasts begin to grow she can not remember exactly which her mother had told her this would come but told her so quickly so much in a hurry and in a small room and with the other things she neglected to say that also they would stop growing so they might not she would have to wear— she learns this in a dream— high heels backward on her feet to keep a symmetry of balance the angrier she gets through the months the more worried she feels at the silliness of how she has begun to grow two new shoulders of how she will have to wear her shoes as bigger one centimeter at a time she sprouts out like buds at first like fast plants then like the trees and finally unstoppable in their season fruit the future she reasons can not be good 2 at 28 she has forgotten what is past she sits and watches now her thighs flowing out like the broad varicosed backs of alligators she has seen in moving pictures pushed out around the metal edges of the lawn chair long and flat animals sated and full of wrinkling ridges held as if by small bones the way camping tents are suspended all from having eaten too many pigs too many birds and cows in the summers of her middle years of crying when she was all mouth and chewing to feel better all without boys no pedro of her own and now the boys can not come close dare not dare the alligators which might come after them 3 but no this is an exaggeration this sadness at het self sadness is like that adding weight to a thing to legs the way legs look as one sits in a chair relaxed or on the edge of a wall as if one were a circus performer with a partner ramón ramón standing feet planted this moment precisely on the thighs but no this is a further exaggeration sadness again is like that it learns you she thinks makes you heavy in those places exactly you have dared think to be strong on thursday the 8th of this month miguel her husband left her but in that odd physics of how distance increased every step she took away from him as she left the house he got farther as she his maría walked out the door he left her and the more she walked the farther he got and smaller she had learned him as one learns a pair of good leather shoes she loved him so much she stopped thinking about him he was like breathing so that when sadness called she went to see what it wanted and did not worry sadness again is like that not telling a person the whole story 4 the orchard was his passion now more than women more than hard words and fast guns in the hands of other men and he tended his trees with fingers he might have used touching the hair of his young cousin lovely marta his wife light skinned eyes the color in the moss and barks of his trees who walked to the river and stayed fingers that might have pointed out to her with care the beaten line a trail made leading to his house their house but he was busy growing the limes so that her hair was like a bramble having to be torn away hard from her leaving the blood all of this she said to him and it was true or not true in a day or a week she would know sadness was in her growing like the unstoppable breasts again but it would stop as it had learned her she had learned it she knew only that next she would have to get the high heels— the dream had come again put them on backward to keep a symmetry of balance for what she wanted to do walk backward to the moment her breasts were those small animals just big enough to touch him with their mouths not angry
last night i traced with my finger the long scar on my love ’ s stomach as if i was following a road on a map i heard the scream of tires saw the flash of chrome her six-year-old body a rag doll bleeding at the seams it is foolish of me to wish i was there before it happened to reach back thirty years clasp her small hand and pull her away from that speeding car that turned her organs into bruised fruit how easily she could have missed her seventh birthday the lit candles waiting for her to blow out their tiny flames how easily i could ’ ve spent last night in a crowded bar instead my shoulders brushing against strangers a man on the jukebox singing his heart out to a woman with the prettiest eyes he ’ s ever seen
you couples lying where moon-scythes and day-scythes reaped you browning fruit falls and sleeps in tangled nests the wild grass falls from your apple tree that still grows here cry for your dead hero his weak sword his flight that you were slaughtered and your bed poured whiteness the issue of murdered marriage dawns the streets crack a house falls open to the air sun and rain lie on the bed and the river still runs in a child ’ s hands under the factory ’ s black hulk four stacks that used to bloom with smoke over shining leaves beneath thunderheads then the storm shatters and beats and after in woods a scented smoke of light a dripping quiet and the small gold snake sparkles at the pond ’ s edge but who is he what were the goods he made what became of his loved wife his children and where has he gone fearsome powerless the silver path of air from the river ’ s bend to its rippling away beneath the low concrete bridge is still pure no one comes and the child who watched by it has vanished or sometimes he appears for a day a night in the walls and windows reflected on the water in goldfinches ’ flight cricket song the heron ’ s great rise from the bank last a carp leaps voices and a lantern slide down the secret stream in black and gold peace past the child ’ s husk the family never born
love brought by night a vision to my bed one that still wore the vesture of a child but eighteen years of age – who sweetly smiled till of the lovely form false hopes were bred and keen embraces wild ah for the lost desire that haunts me yet till mine eyes fail in sleep that finds no more that fleeting ghost oh lovelorn heart give o ’ er – cease thy vain dreams of beauty ’ s warmth – forget the face thou longest for
all ’ s over then does truth sound bitter as one at first believes hark ’ tis the sparrows ’ good-night twitter about your cottage eaves and the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly i noticed that today one day more bursts them open fully – you know the red turns grey tomorrow we meet the same then dearest may i take your hand in mine mere friends are we – well friends the merest keep much that i resign for each glance of the eye so bright and black though i keep with heart ’ s endeavor – your voice when you wish the snowdrops back though it stay in my soul for ever – yet i will but say what mere friends say or only a thought stronger i will hold your hand but as long as all may or so very little longer
we can not live except thus mutually we alternate aware or unaware the reflex act of life and when we bear our virtue onward most impulsively most full of invocation and to be most instantly compellant certes there we live most life whoever breathes most air and counts his dying years by sun and sea but when a soul by choice and conscience doth throw out her full force on another soul the conscience and the concentration both make mere life love for life in perfect whole and aim consummated is love in sooth as nature ’ s magnet-heat rounds pole with pole
love again wanking at ten past three surely he ’ s taken her home by now the bedroom hot as a bakery the drink gone dead without showing how to meet tomorrow and afterwards and the usual pain like dysentery someone else feeling her breasts and cunt someone else drowned in that lash-wide stare and me supposed to be ignorant or find it funny or not to care even ... but why put it into words isolate rather this element that spreads through other lives like a tree and sways them on in a sort of sense and say why it never worked for me something to do with violence a long way back and wrong rewards and arrogant eternity
1. i watched thee when the foe was at our side ready to strike at him—or thee and me were safety hopeless—rather than divide aught with one loved save love and liberty 2. i watched thee on the breakers when the rock received our prow and all was storm and fear and bade thee cling to me through every shock this arm would be thy bark or breast thy bier 3. i watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground when overworn with watching ne ’ er to rise from thence if thou an early grave hadst found 4. the earthquake came and rocked the quivering wall and men and nature reeled as if with wine whom did i seek around the tottering hall for thee whose safety first provide for thine 5. and when convulsive throes denied my breath the faintest utterance to my fading thought to thee—to thee—e ’ en in the gasp of death my spirit turned oh oftener than it ought 6. thus much and more and yet thou lov ’ st me not and never wilt love dwells not in our will nor can i blame thee though it be my lot to strongly wrongly vainly love thee still
love is like the wild rose-briar friendship like the holly-tree— the holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms but which will bloom most constantly the wild rose-briar is sweet in spring its summer blossoms scent the air yet wait till winter comes again and who will call the wild-briar fair then scorn the silly rose-wreath now and deck thee with the holly ’ s sheen that when december blights thy brow he still may leave thy garland green
all my past life is mine no more the flying hours are gone like transitory dreams giv ’ n o ’ er whose images are kept in store by memory alone the time that is to come is not how can it then be mine the present moment ’ s all my lot and that as fast as it is got phyllis is only thine then talk not of inconstancy false hearts and broken vows if i by miracle can be this live-long minute true to thee ’ tis all that heav'n allows
lying asleep between the strokes of night i saw my love lean over my sad bed pale as the duskiest lily ’ s leaf or head smooth-skinned and dark with bare throat made to bite too wan for blushing and too warm for white but perfect-coloured without white or red and her lips opened amorously and said – i wist not what saving one word – delight and all her face was honey to my mouth and all her body pasture to mine eyes the long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire the quivering flanks hair smelling of the south the bright light feet the splendid supple thighs and glittering eyelids of my soul ’ s desire
the eyes open to a cry of pulleys and spirited from sleep the astounded soul hangs for a moment bodiless and simple as false dawn outside the open window the morning air is all awash with angels some are in bed-sheets some are in blouses some are in smocks but truly there they are now they are rising together in calm swells of halcyon feeling filling whatever they wear with the deep joy of their impersonal breathing now they are flying in place conveying the terrible speed of their omnipresence moving and staying like white water and now of a sudden they swoon down into so rapt a quiet that nobody seems to be there the soul shrinks from all that it is about to remember from the punctual rape of every blessèd day and cries “ oh let there be nothing on earth but laundry nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam and clear dances done in the sight of heaven. ” yet as the sun acknowledges with a warm look the world ’ s hunks and colors the soul descends once more in bitter love to accept the waking body saying now in a changed voice as the man yawns and rises “ bring them down from their ruddy gallows let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone and the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating of dark habits keeping their difficult balance ”
let me cook you some dinner sit down and take off your shoes and socks and in fact the rest of your clothes have a daquiri turn on some music and dance around the house inside and out it ’ s night and the neighbors are sleeping those dolts and the stars are shining bright and i ’ ve got the burners lit for you you hungry thing
guy calls the doctor says the wife ’ s contractions are five minutes apart doctor says is this her first child guy says no it ’ s her husband i promise to try to remember who i am wife gets up on one elbow says i wanted to get married it seemed a fulfillment of some several things a thing to be done even the diamond ring was some thing like a quest a thing they set you out to get and how insane the quest is how you have to turn it every way before you can even think to seek it this metaphysical refraining is in fact the quest who ’ d have guessed she sighs i like the predictability of two i like my pleasures fully expected when the expectation of them grows patterned in its steady surprise i ’ ve got my sweet and tumble pat here on earth i like to count upon a thing like that thus explained the woman in contractions to her lover holding on the telephone for the doctor to recover from this strange conversational turn you say you ’ re whom it is a pleasure to meet you she rolls her eyes but he ’ d once asked her am i your first lover and she ’ d said could be your face looks familiar it ’ s the same type of generative error the grammar of the spoken word will flip let alone the written until something new is in us and in our conversation
love is a sickness full of woes all remedies refusing a plant that with most cutting grows most barren with best using why so more we enjoy it more it dies if not enjoyed it sighting cries heigh ho love is a torment of the mind a tempest everlasting and jove hath made it of a kind not well not full nor fasting why so more we enjoy it more it dies if not enjoyed it sighing cries heigh ho
dear miss first of all i want to say that i have enjoyed the imaginary possibility built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature i have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women ... .i have imagined myself in such postures with you where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal ... as men give vast lands to little papers with line and color i have imagined more on the surface of your body giving all the universe in this model ... yet i must be curious about your breasts ... curious ... hungry is the word to see to touch to taste ... .i am curious as to how your hands undress your body i am interested in your mind will you undress in front of me will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off i feel that if i should have my penis in your vagina i should have your love for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons if love has reasons i can not tell ... your admirer
for b. h. i didn ’ t fall in love i fell through it came out the other side moments later hands full of matter waking up from the dream of a bullet tearing through the middle of my body i no longer understand anything for longer than a long moment or the time it takes to receive the shot this kind of gravity is like falling through a cloud forgetting it all and then being told about it later on the day you fell through a cloud it must be true if it were not then when did these strands of silver netting attach to my hair the problem was finding that you were real and not just a dream of clouds if you weren ’ t real i would address this letter to one of two entities myself or everyone else the effect would be equivalent the act of falling happens in time that is it takes long enough for the falling to shear away from the moments before and the moments after long enough for one to have thought i am falling i have been falling i continue to fall falling through a ring in this case would not mean falling through the center of the annulus—a planet floats there falling through the ring means falling through the spaces between the objects that together make the ring on the way through clasp your fists around the universe nothing but ice-gravel but open your hands when you reach the other side quickly before it melts what did i leave you
when i stood behind his desk chair and when he sat on rare occasions on the porch “ sage of anacostia ” they called him i smelled his mane glorious and as a hand saddle the aroma of hair took me to neckline and below in egypt long after napoleon had shot off the face of the sphinx i thought of this man and the cusp of his palms on my shoulder blades as always he was carrying the mail of gender his touch immaculate in the true blend of the cortex and of the complex risen on a pulpit and after the hot air wintry parlance the syllables of my name in his ear when he touched me as he had touched me then i had my suspicions of english ladies actresses ghosts of the thames concubines as we had been into this next century and they had their wiles with him i do not feel forbidden the cameo ring he gave me recession of his maleness all i need and highlights of my dark profile any children we might have had buried in architecture and the hate of his daughter rosetta who i have spoken to over the grate the sun rises and sets in our neighborhood i will burn these but when i place my fingers in that mane it is to the saddle he will come

i follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle under your shoulder lean over your back breathing into your hair and thinking of nothing i want to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop and drift away from all of it our two cars rusting in the parking lot our families whining like tame geese at feeding time and all the bosses of the earth cursing the traffic in the morning haze they will telephone each other from their sofas and glass desks with no idea where we could be unable to picture the dark throat of the saxophone playing upriver or the fire we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light having stolen a truckload of roses and thrown them into the sea

i scarce believe my love to be so pure as i had thought it was because it doth endure vicissitude and season as the grass methinks i lied all winter when i swore my love was infinite if spring make ’ it more but if medicine love which cures all sorrow with more not only be no quintessence but mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense and of the sun his working vigor borrow love ’ s not so pure and abstract as they use to say which have no mistress but their muse but as all else being elemented too love sometimes would contemplate sometimes do and yet no greater but more eminent love by the spring is grown as in the firmament stars by the sun are not enlarged but shown gentle love deeds as blossoms on a bough from love ’ s awakened root do bud out now if as water stirred more circles be produced by one love such additions take those like so many spheres but one heaven make for they are all concentric unto thee and though each spring do add to love new heat as princes do in time of action get new taxes and remit them not in peace no winter shall abate the spring ’ s increase

slight unpremeditated words are borne by every common wind into the air carelessly utter ’ d die as soon as born and in one instant give both hope and fear breathing all contraries with the same wind according to the caprice of the mind but billetdoux are constant witnesses substantial records to eternity just evidences who the truth confess on which the lover safely may rely they ’ re serious thoughts digested and resolv ’ d and last when words are into clouds devolv ’ d

tired of his dark dominion ... —george meredith it was something i ’ d overheard one evening at a party a man i liked enormously saying to a mutual friend a woman wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips that belled below each breast “ well i ’ ve always preferred athens greece seems to me a country of the day—rome i ’ m afraid strikes me as being a city of the night ... ” of course i knew instantly just what he meant— not simply because i love standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening as the constellations pulse low in the roman sky the whole mind of night that i know so well shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite almost divine irony no and it wasn ’ t only that rome was my city of the night that it was here i ’ d chosen to live when i grew tired of my ancient life as the underground man and it wasn ’ t that rome ’ s darkness was of the kind that consoles so many vacancies of the soul my rome with its endless history of falls ... no it was that this dark was the deep sensual dark of the dreamer this dark was like the violet fur spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of the she-wolf—all the sequins above in sequence the white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians a dark like the polished back of a mirror the pool of the night scalloped and hanging above me the inverted reflection of a last odd narcissus ... one night my friend nico came by close to three a.m.—as we drank a little wine i could see the black of her pupils blown wide the spread ripples of the opiate night ... and nico pulled herself close to me her mouth almost touching my mouth as she sighed “ look ... ” and deep within the pupil of her left eye almost like the mirage of a ship ’ s distant hanging lantern rocking with the waves i could see at the most remote end of the receding circular hallway of her eye there at its doorway at the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil a tiny dangling crucifix— silver lit by the ragged shards of starlight reflecting in her as quietly as pain as simply as pain ... some years later i saw nico on stage in new york singing inside loosed sheets of shattered light a fluid kaleidoscope washing over her—the way any naked emerging venus steps up along the scalloped lip of her shell innocent and raw as fate slowly obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple deadly love of sexual sincerity ... i didn ’ t bother to say hello i decided to remember the way in rome out driving at night she ’ d laugh as she let her head fall back against the cracked red leather of my old lancia ’ s seats the soft black wind fanning her pale chalky hair out along its currents ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves the sad lucent malevolence of the heavens falling ... both of us racing silently as light nowhere then forever ... into the mind of the roman night
go to the western gate luke havergal there where the vines cling crimson on the wall and in the twilight wait for what will come the leaves will whisper there of her and some like flying words will strike you as they fall but go and if you listen she will call go to the western gate luke havergal— luke havergal no there is not a dawn in eastern skies to rift the fiery night that ’ s in your eyes but there where western glooms are gathering the dark will end the dark if anything god slays himself with every leaf that flies and hell is more than half of paradise no there is not a dawn in eastern skies— in eastern skies out of a grave i come to tell you this out of a grave i come to quench the kiss that flames upon your forehead with a glow that blinds you to the way that you must go yes there is yet one way to where she is bitter but one that faith may never miss out of a grave i come to tell you this— to tell you this there is the western gate luke havergal there are the crimson leaves upon the wall go for the winds are tearing them away — nor think to riddle the dead words they say nor any more to feel them as they fall but go and if you trust her she will call there is the western gate luke havergal— luke havergal
inside my lunch to my surprise a perfect heart-shaped love note lies the outside says “ will you be mine ” and “ will you be my valentine ” i take it out and wonder who would want to tell me “ i love you. ” perhaps a girl who ’ s much too shy to hand it to me eye to eye or maybe it was sweetly penned in private by a secret friend who found my lunchbox sitting by and slid the note in on the sly oh i ’ d be thrilled if it were jo the cute one in the second row or could it be from jennifer has she found out i ’ m sweet on her my mind ’ s abuzz my shoulders tense i need no more of this suspense my stomach lurching in my throat i open up my little note then wham as if it were a bomb inside it reads “ i love you—mom ”
lying in bed i think about you your ugly empty airless apartment and your eyes it ’ s noon and tired i look into the rest of the awake day incapable of even awe just a presence of particle and wave just that closed and deliberate human observance your thin fingers and the dissolution of all ability lay open now to only me that white body and i will as the awkward butterfly land quietly upon you a grace and staying a sight and ease a spell entangled a span i am inside you and so both projected we are now part of a garden that is part of a landscape that is part of a world that no one believes in
before anything could happen flecks of real gold on her mouth her eyes more convex than any others the ground spoke the barrier of lilacs spoke what sang in the black tree was entirely gold her chair was empty new absence is a great figure dark as the underskin of fruit at the center of the earth it surrounds and amplifies the dead whose music never slows down she came by car i came by train we embraced it was at the foot of a hill steeply crowned with apples and a ruined fortress imagination did not make the world sweetness is the entire portion before anything could happen happiness the necessary precondition of the world spoke and flowered over the hill when i was in hell on the ruined palisade either mystery or loneliness kissed my open eyes it felt hugely convex seeing and immediately forgetting by contrast what i imagined later was nothing
like the idalian queen her hair about her eyne with neck and breast ’ s ripe apples to be seen at first glance of the morn in cyprus ’ gardens gathering those fair flowers which of her blood were born i saw but fainting saw my paramours the graces naked danced about the place the winds and trees amazed with silence on her gazed the flowers did smile like those upon her face and as their aspen stalks those fingers band that she might read my case a hyacinth i wished me in her hand
i was enriched not casting after marvels but as one walking in a usual place without desert but common eyes and ears no recourse but to hear power but to see got to love you of grace subtle musicians that could body wind or contrive strings to anguish in conceit random and artless strung a branch with bells fixed in one silver whim which at a touch shook and were sweet and you you lovely and unpurchased note one run distraught and vexing hot and cold to give to the heart ’ s poor confusion tongue by chance caught you and henceforth all unlearned repeats you gold
the man moves earth to dispel grief he digs holes the size of cars in proportion to what is taken what is given multiplies— rain-swollen ponds and dirt mounds rooted with flame-tipped flowers he carries trees like children struggling to be set down trees that have lived out their lives he cuts and stacks like loaves of bread which he will feed the fire the green smoke sweetens his house the woman sweeps air to banish sadness she dusts floors polishes objects made of clay and wood in proportion to what is taken what is given multiplies— the task of something else to clean gleaming appliances beg to be smudged breathed upon by small children and large animals flicking out hope as she whirls by flap of tongue scratch of paw sweetly reminding her the man moves earth the woman sweeps air together they pull water out of the other pull with the muscular ache of the living hauling from the deep well of the body the rain-swollen the flame-tipped the milk-fed— all that cycles through lives moving lives sweeping water circulating between them like breath drawn out of leaves by light

i have led her home my love my only friend there is none like her none and never yet so warmly ran my blood and sweetly on and on calming itself to the long-wished-for end full to the banks close on the promised good none like her none just now the dry-tongued laurels ’ pattering talk seem ’ d her light foot along the garden walk and shook my heart to think she comes once more but even then i heard her close the door the gates of heaven are closed and she is gone there is none like her none nor will be when our summers have deceased o art thou sighing for lebanon in the long breeze that streams to thy delicious east sighing for lebanon dark cedar tho ’ thy limbs have here increased upon a pastoral slope as fair and looking to the south and fed with honeyed rain and delicate air and haunted by the starry head of her whose gentle will has changed my fate and made my life a perfumed altar-frame and over whom thy darkness must have spread with such delight as theirs of old thy great forefathers of the thornless garden there shadowing the snow-limbed eve from whom she came here will i lie while these long branches sway and you fair stars that crown a happy day go in and out as if at merry play who am no more so all forlorn as when it seemed far better to be born to labour and the mattock-hardened hand than nursed at ease and brought to understand a sad astrology the boundless plan that makes you tyrants in your iron skies innumerable pitiless passionless eyes cold fires yet with power to burn and brand his nothingness into man but now shine on and what care i who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl the countercharm of space and hollow sky and do accept my madness and would die to save from some slight shame one simple girl would die for sullen-seeming death may give more life to love than is or ever was in our low world where yet ’ tis sweet to live let no one ask me how it came to pass it seems that i am happy that to me a livelier emerald twinkles in the grass a purer sapphire melts into the sea not die but live a life of truest breath and teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs oh why should love like men in drinking-songs spice his fair banquet with the dust of death make answer maud my bliss maud made my maud by that long loving kiss life of my life wilt thou not answer this “ the dusky strand of death inwoven here with dear love ’ s tie makes love himself more dear. ” is that enchanted moan only the swell of the long waves that roll in yonder bay and hark the clock within the silver knell of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white and die to live long as my pulses play but now by this my love has closed her sight and given false death her hand and stol ’ n away to dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell among the fragments of the golden day may nothing there her maiden grace affright dear heart i feel with thee the drowsy spell my bride to be my evermore delight my own heart ’ s heart my ownest own farewell it is but for a little space i go and ye meanwhile far over moor and fell beat to the noiseless music of the night has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow of your soft splendour that you look so bright i have climbed nearer out of lonely hell beat happy stars timing with things below beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell blest but for some dark undercurrent woe that seems to draw—but it shall not be so let all be well be well
swung from the toes out belly-breath riding on the knuckles the ten-pound maul lifts up sails in an arc overhead and then lifts you it floats you float for an instant of clear far sight— eye on the crack in the end-grain angle of the oak round stood up to wait to be split the maul falls—with a sigh—the wood claps apart and lies twain— in a wink as the maul splits all may you two stay together
all the new thinking is about loss in this it resembles all the old thinking the idea for example that each particular erases the luminous clarity of a general idea that the clown- faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk of that black birch is by his presence some tragic falling off from a first world of undivided light or the other notion that because there is in this world no one thing to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds a word is elegy to what it signifies we talked about it late last night and in the voice of my friend there was a thin wire of grief a tone almost querulous after a while i understood that talking this way everything dissolves justice pine hair woman you and i. there was a woman i made love to and i remembered how holding her small shoulders in my hands sometimes i felt a violent wonder at her presence like a thirst for salt for my childhood river with its island willows silly music from the pleasure boat muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish called pumpkinseed it hardly had to do with her longing we say because desire is full of endless distances i must have been the same to her but i remember so much the way her hands dismantled bread the thing her father said that hurt her what she dreamed there are moments when the body is as numinous as words days that are the good flesh continuing such tenderness those afternoons and evenings saying blackberry blackberry blackberry

the column of the commander yielded to our first sweep even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall of the general ’ s tomb without knowing it so we began his armies retook nubia libya and the levant lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed sun king overseer of all scribes overseer of the priests of horus grain-giver to all lands royal chief of staff regent the general had himself carried on his palanquin through the wailing processions to oversee the work on this place and so carved thus one of his men punches a nubian in the face the general was low-born everything had

do not figure here or the comeback challenge nuts in the ardennes winter forest he had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead in the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff to a higher private terrace looking across to memphis but then he rose to pharaoh so he is not here instead his first wife lay here and then his queen also at his own royal tomb in the valley where the designs remained uncarved sketching idea along stone he does not rest either the fine picklock hand got past anubis and the reared serpents and got to him the lord of upper and lower egypt it got past truth with her high feather which moved at the slightest disturbance the general did deep obeisance to her he is not here what at last moves the heart so much already moved even in his own century architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations so coleridge who was indisposed that day prudently remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off on their walk through the countryside he followed them in his mind that way no one would have to dismantle horeheb ’ s outer court to secure bricks for the statuary room and facing stones he cast his mind outward a net over his dear ones sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples hill lines and the murder of lamb ’ s mother by his sister a brief madness thus through the appropriately middle distance where such things are built and performed in fact no closer no farther then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse evening in the bath of waning fire one bird stitching the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem— though he was not there he could tell them that none the less he was next to his words and his word was with them even unto the

his clinching point approaching when suddenly he stared out in silence and at last said ladies and gentlemen esteemed colleagues the only thing i can see at this moment inside my brain such as it is is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball their laughter recovered him but he ’ d found he was not there and nietzsche smooched the dray horse soon too he was not there or rather in five places seeking cartage and thinking he ’ d found it what removal does not pass through the rippling pump room the g.i whose father had been raised in a swiss house along one of the lakes knocked in

it and there is no strain on his face valves of space intervene between the stone and his palms its basal flare like a parasol shelters him who under any other circumstances in that spot would be red gristle twelve tons but chiseled at the requisite depth he goes in beneath it and rises light with him and he ’ s not there nor are you there finisher still here and breathing me though steadily you intimate such but paradox is your forte you whose touch lifted this very weight for awhile pass fluttering interpreter of the last things in our tawdry updrafts of the fake the last first butterfly my brothers maintain that the hot wind is friend lifter of stones trembler of heavy horizons for they half-remember that for them you vanished into ripples at the join of sky and dust until the column

“ who are you to tell us how to live or why et cetera ” no man of course and not so tall as is the current fashion nor smart enough in the acceptable modern way to enthrall the crowd with stories of my life among the savages where i was home and growing baffled day by day raging through the night as if it were new music i made groaing it came to me today at lunch the sound of women in the next booth a voice like aunt odile ’ s—whom i never knew well nor did i like her but not her spite but her voice like home-grown fame a touch gravelly a considerable groan itself it seemed they spoke outmoded french around me never to me except to taunt i thought she leaned above me on those visits speaking to mother in their private french laughing a boy surrounded by the sound of foreign tongues knowing what wasn ’ t meant for him toy temptations suggestive coils of syllables i learned latin for mass and did love its terrific laddered randomness the blessed hovering virgin above every station of a boy ’ s new path hormonal disharmonies her praises sung into hundreds the first tuesday of every month and yet latin could not expose such shreds of glittering flesh as i found in french not like the living tongue whose tip twined into an uncle ’ s mustache as he leered at the wrong aunt and winked and a fine distance crystallized loud there then gone crashing like german father ’ s family spoke clear english among the bayous boys and girls of immigrants accentless happily german through two wars not counting civil i had the tongue for arithmetic and spoke it beautifully i loved to count precision ’ s a tempting career clicking into a future like an abacus ignoring all those accents around i never learned the luck of any but english bland and bound but only yesterday i heard a word the mechanic said in czech to his cousin—shop rag—clearly centered in a welter of incomprehension the wreck of my car at their wretched mercies shop rag and he wiped his hands and cried for me shrugging like a cousin would i wrote a check i drove home or tried so does it count am i a man of passion or child of comprehension “ father of little lusts driving myself home who thinks buy some sentiment a little like love and she must speak french this time she longs for you you know it isn ’ t just the money america loves you for yourself alone ” and so i go for professional help honey- blond hair and a disposition like a happy banker whose french for dear sounds like dog the cost of living is going up loving her here
we spend our morning in the flower stalls counting the dark tongues of bells that hang from ropes waiting for the silence of an hour we find a table ask for paella cold soup and wine where a calm light trembles years behind us in buenos aires only three years ago it was the last time his hand slipped into her dress with pearls cooling her throat and bells like these chipping at the night— as she talks the hollow clopping of a horse the sound of bones touched together the paella comes a bed of rice and camarones fingers and shells the lips of those whose lips have been removed mussels the soft blue of a leg socket this is not paella this is what has become of those who remained in buenos aires this is the ring of a rifle report on the stones her hand over her mouth her husband falling against her these are the flowers we bought this morning the dahlias tossed on his grave and bells waiting with their tongues cut out for this particular silence
in love if love be love if love be ours faith and unfaith can ne ’ er be equal powers unfaith in aught is want of faith in all it is the little rift within the lute that by and by will make the music mute and ever widening slowly silence all the little rift within the lover ’ s lute or little pitted speck in garner ’ d fruit that rotting inward slowly moulders all it is not worth the keeping let it go but shall it answer darling answer no and trust me not at all or all in all

the surfers beautiful as men can be ride the warm blue green swells and the white sand is alive with girls outriggers double boats ride the waves back in as the native warriors did i tried to swim and tried to look but ended up just going back a huge perfect black man at the beach somehow drove me away a block to st. augustine ’ s church the bodies were giv- ing me a fit and i have come to seek the momentary calm we find sometimes in the musk of christ when he was awake and sweat- ing blood as others slept or like a furious bouncer hustling out the money changers the bodies of mary and christ both still live we ’ re told they ’ re alive and thus must have dealt with the stress of that long time of turning on to being young i speak of teens fifteen and ten years ago when i first confessed it was in this same church built then as a gigantic shed where the strange hawaiian birds i forgot their names—no matter flew in and out of the high wood- en rafters like the whimsical winds of grace and grace gives back to sight what beauty is— as that loveliness at the beach now the church has been rebuilt in pointed stone across the street from a much higher new hotel where at lunch i almost spilled and found i could not eat the purple orchid in my drink

it is the miller ’ s daughter and she is grown so dear so dear that i would be the jewel that trembles at her ear for hid in ringlets day and night i ’ d touch her neck so warm and white and i would be the girdle about her dainty dainty waist and her heart would beat against me in sorrow and in rest and i should know if it beat right i ’ d clasp it round so close and tight and i would be the necklace and all day long to fall and rise upon her balmy bosom with her laughter or her sighs and i would lie so light so light i scarce should be unclasped at night
summoned by conscious recollection she would be smiling they might be in a kitchen talking before or after dinner but they are in this other room the window has many small panes and they are on a couch embracing he holds her as tightly as he can she buries herself in his body morning maybe it is evening light is flowing through the room outside the day is slowly succeeded by night succeeded by day the process wobbles wildly and accelerates weeks months years the light in the room does not change so it is plain what is happening they are trying to become one creature and something will not have it they are tender with each other afraid their brief sharp cries will reconcile them to the moment when they fall away again so they rub against each other their mouths dry then wet then dry they feel themselves at the center of a powerful and baffled will they feel they are an almost animal washed up on the shore of a world— or huddled against the gate of a garden— to which they can ’ t admit they can never be admitted
alexandria 1956 after the nationalization of the suez canal and all foreign capital perhaps her cook come under the influence of a few discreet piastres had spoken too indiscreetly or just perhaps on a hot day along the azure of the mediterranean rue fouad bearing a stream of traffic to muhammed ali square in a riot of klaxons and shouts and the whole city gleaming white as it must have from a distance perhaps on such a day someone got lucky and mme sperides at the customs house could sense what price she would have to pay that the official full of apologies and gold teeth would usher her into a private room smelling of dark tobacco that under the drone of the ceiling fans her valises would be searched the linings cut out the cowhide ripped back that despite her protests which would be useless but obligatory she herself would be stripped that finally two large diamonds worth a modest villa would peek and shine from the elegant crack of her ass whatever the story it was not for a boy to know i listened at my grandmother ’ s door as she spoke in a whisper thieving a fragment here a word there naked jewels hidden you know where though i didn ’ t and tried to call up all that i remembered mme sperides in her salon serving us tea and the small cucumber sandwiches whose flavor always reminded me of paste mme sperides falling easily back in her chair crossing her legs intoning “ you know what my husband left me it is not much to live on in these times. ” mme sperides ringing for her servants who swished in and out in their galabiyas expressionless almost invisible bringing us fruits and petit fours and now mme sperides naked jewels hidden somewhere in my imagination somewhere in the words my grandmother whispered and i smuggled out with my ear at the door holding my breath thinking the world would suddenly reveal itself with one prize word some dark knowledge “ i love you mme sperides ” i tried with a small boy ’ s passion believing that was enough to bring her secretly to me translucent and shimmering but when i closed my eyes in my fever all i could see was mme sperides laden with rings and pearls bracelets and brooches mme sperides hidden by jewelry and clothing something else hidden beyond all that all i could taste was cucumber all i could hear was the undercurrent of long robes swishing from room to room
it is not the moon i tell you it is these flowers lighting the yard i hate them i hate them as i hate sex the man ’ s mouth sealing my mouth the man ’ s paralyzing body— and the cry that always escapes the low humiliating premise of union— in my mind tonight i hear the question and pursuing answer fused in one sound that mounts and mounts and then is split into the old selves the tired antagonisms do you see we were made fools of and the scent of mock orange drifts through the window how can i rest how can i be content when there is still that odor in the world
i swive as well as others do i ’ m young not yet deformed my tender heart sincere and true deserves not to be scorned why phyllis then why will you swive with forty lovers more can i said she with nature strive alas i am alas i am a whore were all my body larded o ’ er with darts of love so thick that you might find in ev ’ ry pore a well stuck standing prick whilst yet my eyes alone were free my heart would never doubt in am ’ rous rage and ecstasy to wish those eyes to wish those eyes fucked out
and what is love it is a doll dress ’ d up for idleness to cosset nurse and dandle a thing of soft misnomers so divine that silly youth doth think to make itself divine by loving and so goes on yawning and doting a whole summer long till miss ’ s comb is made a pearl tiara and common wellingtons turn romeo boots then cleopatra lives at number seven and antony resides in brunswick square fools if some passions high have warm ’ d the world if queens and soldiers have play ’ d deep for hearts it is no reason why such agonies should be more common than the growth of weeds fools make me whole again that weighty pearl the queen of egypt melted and i ’ ll say that ye may love in spite of beaver hats
he felt the wild beast in him betweenwhiles so masterfully rude that he would grieve to see the helpless delicate thing receive his guardianship through certain dark defiles had he not teeth to rend and hunger too but still he spared her once ‘ have you no fear ’ he said ’ twas dusk she in his grasp none near she laughed ‘ no surely am i not with you ’ and uttering that soft starry ‘ you ’ she leaned her gentle body near him looking up and from her eyes as from a poison-cup he drank until the flittering eyelids screened devilish malignant witch and oh young beam of heaven ’ s circle-glory here they shape to squeeze like an intoxicating grape – i might and yet thou goest safe supreme
yet it was plain she struggled and that salt of righteous feeling made her pitiful poor twisting worm so queenly beautiful where came the cleft between us whose the fault my tears are on thee that have rarely dropped as balm for any bitter wound of mine my breast will open for thee at a sign but no we are two reed-pipes coarsely stopped the god once filled them with his mellow breath and they were music till he flung them down used used hear now the discord-loving clown puff his gross spirit in them worse than death i do not know myself without thee more in this unholy battle i grow base if the same soul be under the same face speak and a taste of that old time restore
he found her by the ocean ’ s moaning verge nor any wicked change in her discerned and she believed his old love had returned which was her exultation and her scourge she took his hand and walked with him and seemed the wife he sought though shadow-like and dry she had one terror lest her heart should sigh and tell her loudly that she no longer dreamed she dared not say ‘ this is my breast look in. ’ but there ’ s a strength to help the desperate weak that night he learned how silence best can speak the awful things when pity pleads for sin about the middle of the night her call was heard and he came wondering to the bed ‘ now kiss me dear it may be now ’ she said lethe had passed those lips and he knew all
the lowest trees have tops the ant her gall the fly her spleen the little sparks their heat the slender hairs cast shadows though but small and bees have stings although they be not great seas have their source and so have shallow springs and love is love in beggars as in kings where rivers smoothest run deep are the fords the dial stirs yet none perceives it move the firmest faith is in the fewest words the turtles can not sing and yet they love true hearts have eyes and ears no tongues to speak they hear and see and sigh and then they break

1. language must suffice years ago under a sweet june sky stung with stars and swept back by black leaves barely rustling a beautiful woman nearly killed me listen she said and turned her lovely face to the stars the wild sky ... 2. no no years ago under a sweet june sky strung with stars and swept back by black leaves barely rustling under this sky broad bright all rung around with rustling elders—or intoxicating willows or oaks i forget— under this sky a beautiful woman killed me nearly i say beautiful you had to see her listen she said and turned a lovely shell of her ear to the swirl of stars and the moon smudged as a wingtip in one tree not far 3. yes she scraped my back bloody against a rough trunk yes she flung back her lovely face and her hair holding me down and the tree shook slowly as in a mild persistent laugh or wind and the moon high in that black tree swung to and fro ... there were millions of stars up where she stared past us and one moon i think 4. excuse me my friend who loves poetry truly says too much nature taints my work yes yes yes too many birds stars— too much rain too much grass— so many wild bowing limbs howling or groaning into the natural night ... and he might be right even here that is if tree were a tree that is if star or moon or even beautiful woman craning the shell of her ear were what they were they are i think not no and a poem about nature contains anything but 5. when they descended to us they were a cloud of stars sweeping lightly they sang to us urgently about our lives they touched us with a hundred thousand hair-soft small legs— and held down by such hungers we let them cover us this beautiful woman this me who couldn ’ t move who were stung—do you hear — who were stung again were covered that quickly crying to each other to fly away 6 ... i just can ’ t erase the exquisite weeping language of the wasps nor her face in starlight and so tranquil under that false papery bobbing moon just minutes before saying listen listen nor then the weight of her whole natural body pinning down mine until we both cried out for fear and pain and still couldn ’ t move 7. language must suffice first it doesn ’ t then of course it does listen listen what do you hear this nearly killed me i ’ ll never know why she didn ’ t just whisper here they come warn move cry they ’ ll kill us yes i will save you ... yes i love you too much to watch you suffer but it ’ s all i recall or now need and anyway i loved her she was so beautiful and that is what i have had to say before it ’ s too late before they have killed me before they have killed you too or before we have all become something else entirely which is to say before we are only language

he says he doesn ’ t feel like working today it ’ s just as well here in the shade behind the house protected from street noises one can go over all kinds of old feeling throw some away keep others the wordplay between us gets very intense when there are fewer feelings around to confuse things another go-round no but the last things you always find to say are charming and rescue me before the night does we are afloat on our dreams as on a barge made of ice shot through with questions and fissures of starlight that keep us awake thinking about the dreams as they are happening some occurrence you said it i said it but i can hide it but i choose not to thank you you are a very pleasant person thank you you are too

it doesn ’ t take the full-wind sickness just the mere the constant threat of it just the salt trace its faint knocking to bring the spirits of chance and chaos into this house they stand in doorways quaint foul allies swivelling their ghost hips tugging at their gowns of transparency and mischief they buzz me with lust and i ’ m undone remember these the cupid who ducked up from behind a wall and aimed an arrow one evening on broughton street whatever grabbed my shoulder at earlshall a sound of heavy boxes pushed up and down the empty hallway the past is the self ’ s ghoul what is it roddy you know you ’ ve blocked out what left your brain so empty that it gushed full with circus music and the safe bet of trivia here i am swinging on the fence of fences in limbo where the other world loves to try my pragmatism and it ’ s i who have invited them summoned by this self-indulgent ouija but what is it that folds my clothes as i sleep and leaves them on the edge of the bed who hides my slippers re-hangs the paintings deja vu did a minor goddess filch me in manila and follow me home prone as they are to easy-led mortal men and i ’ m easy easy so come now teach me to believe in the soul hurt me with the truth press me back down on this cheap wine-coloured carpet let me know for once and for all how fucked i am
one by one they appear in the darkness a few friends and a few with historical names how late they start to shine but before they fade they stand perfectly embodied all the past lapping them like a cloak of chaos they were men who i thought lived only to renew the wasteful force they spent with each hot convulsion they remind me distant now true they are not at rest yet but now that they are indeed apart winnowed from failures they withdraw to an orbit and turn with disinterested hard energy like the stars
my sweetest lesbia let us live and love and though the sager sort our deeds reprove let us not weigh them heaven ’ s great lamps do dive into their west and straight again revive but soon as once set is our little light then must we sleep one ever-during night if all would lead their lives in love like me then bloody swords and armor should not be no drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move unless alarm came from the camp of love but fools do live and waste their little light and seek with pain their ever-during night when timely death my life and fortune ends let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends but let all lovers rich in triumph come and with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb and lesbia close up thou my little light and crown with love my ever-during night

what do we need for love—a midnight fire flinging itself by fistfuls up the chimney in soft bright snatches do we need the snow gentle as silence covering the scars of weeks of hunger years of shabby having summer or winter a heaven of stars a room the smiling mouth the sadness of desire are everywhere the same if lovers go along an unknown road they find no less what is familiar let them stay at home and all will still be strange this they know who with each heartbeat fight the fear of change
we stood by a pond that winter day and the sun was white as though chidden of god and a few leaves lay on the starving sod – they had fallen from an ash and were gray your eyes on me were as eyes that rove over tedious riddles of years ago and some words played between us to and fro on which lost the more by our love the smile on your mouth was the deadest thing alive enough to have strength to die and a grin of bitterness swept thereby like an ominous bird a-wing… since then keen lessons that love deceives and wrings with wrong have shaped to me your face and the god curst sun and a tree and a pond edged with grayish leaves
never love unless you can bear with all the faults of man men sometimes will jealous be though but little cause they see and hang the head as discontent and speak what straight they will repent men that but one saint adore make a show of love to more beauty must be scorned in none though but truly served in one for what is courtship but disguise true hearts may have dissembling eyes men when their affairs require must awhile themselves retire sometimes hunt and sometimes hawk and not ever sit and talk if these and such-like you can bear then like and love and never fear

the nightingale as soon as april bringeth unto her rested sense a perfect waking while late bare earth proud of new clothing springeth sings out her woes a thorn her song-book making and mournfully bewailing her throat in tunes expresseth what grief her breast oppresseth for tereus ’ force on her chaste will prevailing o philomela fair o take some gladness that here is juster cause of plaintful sadness thine earth now springs mine fadeth thy thorn without my thorn my heart invadeth alas she hath no other cause of anguish but tereus ’ love on her by strong hand wroken wherein she suffering all her spirits languish full womanlike complains her will was broken but i who daily craving can not have to content me have more cause to lament me since wanting is more woe than too much having o philomela fair o take some gladness that here is juster cause of plaintful sadness thine earth now springs mine fadeth thy thorn without my thorn my heart invadeth
tell me no more of minds embracing minds and hearts exchang ’ d for hearts that spirits spirits meet as winds do winds and mix their subt ’ lest parts that two unbodied essences may kiss and then like angels twist and feel one bliss i was that silly thing that once was wrought to practise this thin love i climb ’ d from sex to soul from soul to thought but thinking there to move headlong i rolled from thought to soul and then from soul i lighted at the sex again as some strict down-looked men pretend to fast who yet in closets eat so lovers who profess they spirits taste feed yet on grosser meat i know they boast they souls to souls convey howe ’ r they meet the body is the way come i will undeceive thee they that tread those vain aerial ways are like young heirs and alchemists misled to waste their wealth and days for searching thus to be for ever rich they only find a med ’ cine for the itch

now winter nights enlarge the number of their hours and clouds their storms discharge upon the airy towers let now the chimneys blaze and cups o ’ erflow with wine let well-turned words amaze with harmony divine now yellow waxen lights shall wait on honey love while youthful revels masques and courtly sights sleep ’ s leaden spells remove this time doth well dispense with lovers ’ long discourse much speech hath some defense though beauty no remorse all do not all things well some measures comely tread some knotted riddles tell some poems smoothly read the summer hath his joys and winter his delights though love and all his pleasures are but toys they shorten tedious nights
if all the world and love were young and truth in every shepherd ’ s tongue these pretty pleasures might me move to live with thee and be thy love time drives the flocks from field to fold when rivers rage and rocks grow cold and philomel becometh dumb the rest complains of cares to come the flowers do fade and wanton fields to wayward winter reckoning yields a honey tongue a heart of gall is fancy ’ s spring but sorrow ’ s fall thy gowns thy shoes thy beds of roses thy cap thy kirtle and thy posies soon break soon wither soon forgotten in folly ripe in reason rotten thy belt of straw and ivy buds the coral clasps and amber studs all these in me no means can move to come to thee and be thy love but could youth last and love still breed had joys no date nor age no need then these delights my mind might move to live with thee and be thy love

four white heifers with sprawling hooves trundle the waggon its ill-roped crates heavy with fruit sway the chisel point of the goad blue and white glitters ahead a flame to follow lance-high in a man ’ s hand who does not shave his linen trousers like him want washing you can see his baked skin through his shirt he has no shoes and his hat has a hole in it ‘ hu vaca hu vaca ’ he says staccato without raising his voice ‘ adios caballero ’ legato but in the same tone camelmen high on muzzled mounts boots rattling against the panels of an empty packsaddle do not answer strangers each with his train of seven or eight tied head to tail they pass silent but for the heavy bells and plip of slobber dripping from muzzle to dust save that on sand their soles squeak slightly milkmaids friendly girls between fourteen and twenty or younger bolt upright on small trotting donkeys that bray they arch their tails a few inches from the root stretch neck and jaw forward to make the windpipe a trumpet chatter jolted cans clatter the girls ’ smiles repeat the black silk curve of the wimple under the chin their hats are absurd doll ’ s hats or flat-crowned to take a load all have fine eyes you can guess their balanced nakedness under the cotton gown and thin shift they sing and laugh they say ‘ adios ’ shyly but look back more than once knowing our thoughts and sharing our desires and lack of faith in desire
how love came in i do not know whether by th ’ eye or eare or no or whether with the soule it came at first infused with the same whether in part ‘ tis here or there or like the soule whole every where this troubles me but as i well as any other this can tell that when from hence she does depart the out-let then is from the heart

as hermes once took to his feathers light when lulled argus baffled swoon ’ d and slept so on a delphic reed my idle spright so play ’ d so charm ’ d so conquer ’ d so bereft the dragon-world of all its hundred eyes and seeing it asleep so fled away not to pure ida with its snow-cold skies nor unto tempe where jove griev ’ d that day but to that second circle of sad hell where in the gust the whirlwind and the flaw of rain and hail-stones lovers need not tell their sorrows—pale were the sweet lips i saw pale were the lips i kiss ’ d and fair the form i floated with about that melancholy storm
that which her slender waist confin ’ d shall now my joyful temples bind no monarch but would give his crown his arms might do what this has done it was my heaven ’ s extremest sphere the pale which held that lovely deer my joy my grief my hope my love did all within this circle move a narrow compass and yet there dwelt all that ’ s good and all that ’ s fair give me but what this ribbon bound take all the rest the sun goes round
i grieve and dare not show my discontent i love and yet am forced to seem to hate i do yet dare not say i ever meant i seem stark mute but inwardly do prate i am and not i freeze and yet am burned since from myself another self i turned my care is like my shadow in the sun follows me flying flies when i pursue it stands and lies by me doth what i have done his too familiar care doth make me rue it no means i find to rid him from my breast till by the end of things it be supprest some gentler passion slide into my mind for i am soft and made of melting snow or be more cruel love and so be kind let me or float or sink be high or low or let me live with some more sweet content or die and so forget what love ere meant
good heav ’ n i thank thee since it was designed i should be framed but of the weaker kind that yet my soul is rescued from the love of all those trifles which their passions move pleasures and praise and plenty have with me but their just value if allowed they be freely and thankfully as much i taste as will not reason or religion waste if they ’ re denied i on my self can live and slight those aids unequal chance does give when in the sun my wings can be displayed and in retirement i can bless the shade
once we played at love together— played it smartly if you please lightly as a windblown feather did we stake a heart apiece oh it was delicious fooling in the hottest of the game without thought of future cooling all too quickly burned life ’ s flame in this give-and-take of glances kisses sweet as honey dews when we played with equal chances did you win or did i lose
i like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough atop on the topmost twig — which the pluckers forgot somehow — forget it not nay but got it not for none could get it till now ii like the wild hyacinth flower which on the hills is found which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound until the purple blossom is trodden in the ground
i don ’ t love you as if you were a rose of salt topaz or arrow of carnations that propagate fire i love you as one loves certain obscure things secretly between the shadow and the soul i love you as the plant that doesn ’ t bloom but carries the light of those flowers hidden within itself and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose from the earth lives dimly in my body i love you without knowing how or when or from where i love you directly without problems or pride i love you like this because i don ’ t know any other way to love except in this form in which i am not nor are you so close that your hand upon my chest is mine so close that your eyes close with my dreams
yellow pines no ever no green except where stems brown needles green i walk on the wooden train the fall ’ s water you swam in one cold morning what you braved that ice path a horse fence where fences are horses with long hair i braid the tale of the fall of stables four paws touch dirt stirring a flirt of sky a bundle of rare you bundle into stables i open with sandy tongue taste the grain of barkwater i look at myself in a mirror of weather rain trenzas dirt cups us we drink spin like tornillos a swallow ’ s nest like an adobe tornado shit mud feathers forming pitchfork claws eggshells gone we rest in the ocean smalls the pink throat the back door is also the front the only smoke hole feathers rise we follow

death ’ s carols carols under that lagging yellow waning moon o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea o reckless despairing carols but soft sink low soft let me just murmur and do you wait a moment you husky-nois ’ d sea for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me so faint i must be still be still to listen but not altogether still for then she might not come immediately to me hither my love here i am here with this just-sustain ’ d note i announce myself to you this gentle call is for you my love for you do not be decoy ’ d elsewhere that is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice that is the fluttering the fluttering of the spray those are the shadows of leaves o darkness o in vain o i am very sick and sorrowful o brown halo in the sky near the moon drooping upon the sea o troubled reflection in the sea o throat o throbbing heart and i singing uselessly uselessly all the night o past o happy life o songs of joy in the air in the woods over fields loved loved loved loved loved but my mate no more no more with me we two together no more the aria sinking all else continuing the stars shining the winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoing with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning on the sands of paumanok ’ s shore gray and rustling the yellow half-moon enlarged sagging down drooping the face of the sea almost touching the boy ecstatic with his bare feet the waves with his hair the atmosphere dallying the love in the heart long pent now loose now at last tumultuously bursting the aria ’ s meaning the ears the soul swiftly depositing the strange tears down the cheeks coursing the colloquy there the trio each uttering the undertone the savage old mother incessantly crying to the boy ’ s soul ’ s questions sullenly timing some drown ’ d secret hissing to the outsetting bard demon or bird said the boy ’ s soul is it indeed toward your mate you sing or is it really to me for i that was a child my tongue ’ s use sleeping now i have heard you now in a moment i know what i am for i awake and already a thousand singers a thousand songs clearer louder and more sorrowful than yours a thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me never to die o you singer solitary singing by yourself projecting me o solitary me listening never more shall i cease perpetuating you never more shall i escape never more the reverberations never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what there in the night by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon the messenger there arous ’ d the fire the sweet hell within the unknown want the destiny of me o give me the clew it lurks in the night here somewhere o if i am to have so much let me have more a word then for i will conquer it the word final superior to all subtle sent up—what is it —i listen are you whispering it and have been all the time you sea-waves is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands whereto answering the sea delaying not hurrying not whisper ’ d me through the night and very plainly before day-break lisp ’ d to me the low and delicious word death and again death death death death hissing melodious neither like the bird nor like my arous ’ d child ’ s heart but edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over death death death death death which i do not forget but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanok ’ s gray beach with the thousand responsive songs at random my own songs awaked from that hour and with them the key the word up from the waves the word of the sweetest song and all songs that strong and delicious word which creeping to my feet or like some old crone rocking the cradle swathed in sweet garments bending aside the sea whisper ’ d me
out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me whispering i love you before long i die i have travell ’ d a long way merely to look on you to touch you for i could not die till i once look ’ d on you for i fear ’ d i might afterward lose you now we have met we have look ’ d we are safe return in peace to the ocean my love i too am part of that ocean my love we are not so much separated behold the great rondure the cohesion of all how perfect but as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us as for an hour carrying us diverse yet can not carry us diverse forever be not impatient – a little space – know you i salute the air the ocean and the land every day at sundown for your dear sake my love
i oh chimes set high on the sunny tower ring on ring on unendingly make all the hours a single hour for when the dusk begins to flower the man i love will come to me ... but no go slowly as you will i should not bid you hasten so for while i wait for love to come some other girl is standing dumb fearing her love will go ii oh white steam over the roofs blow high oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free oh sun awake in the covered sky for the man i love loves me ... oh drifting steam disperse and die oh tower stand shrouded toward the south — fate heard afar my happy cry and laid her finger on my mouth iii the dusk was blue with blowing mist the lights were spangles in a veil and from the clamor far below floated faint music like a wail it voiced what i shall never speak my heart was breaking all night long but when the dawn was hard and gray my tears distilled into a song iv i said “ i have shut my heart as one shuts an open door that love may starve therein and trouble me no more. ” but over the roofs there came the wet new wind of may and a tune blew up from the curb where the street-pianos play my room was white with the sun and love cried out to me “ i am strong i will break your heart unless you set me free ”
on a small lake off the map of the world two swans lived as swans they spent eighty percent of the day studying themselves in the attentive water and twenty percent ministering to the beloved other thus their fame as lovers stems chiefly from narcissism which leaves so little leisure for more general cruising but fate had other plans after ten years they hit slimy water whatever the filth was it clung to the male ’ s plumage which turned instantly gray simultaneously the true purpose of his neck ’ s flexible design revealed itself so much action on the flat lake so much he ’ s missed sooner or later in a long life together every couple encounters some emergency like this some drama which results in harm this occurs for a reason to test love and to demand fresh articulation of its complex terms so it came to light that the male and female flew under different banners whereas the male believed that love was what one felt in one ’ s heart the female believed love was what one did but this is not a little story about the male ’ s inherent corruption using as evidence the swan ’ s sleazy definition of purity it is a story of guile and innocence for ten years the female studied the male she dallied when he slept or when he was conveniently absorbed in the water while the spontaneous male acted casually on the whim of the moment on the muddy water they bickered awhile in the fading light until the bickering grew slowly abstract becoming part of their song after a little longer

ay gaze upon her rose-wreathed hair and gaze upon her smile seem as you drank the very air her breath perfumed the while and wake for her the gifted line that wild and witching lay and swear your heart is as a shrine that only owns her sway ’ tis well i am revenged at last — mark you that scornful cheek — the eye averted as you pass ’ d spoke more than words could speak ay now by all the bitter tears that i have shed for thee — the racking doubts the burning fears — avenged they well may be— by the nights pass ’ d in sleepless care the days of endless woe all that you taught my heart to bear all that yourself will know i would not wish to see you laid within an early tomb i should forget how you betray ’ d and only weep your doom but this is fitting punishment to live and love in vain — oh my wrung heart be thou content and feed upon his pain go thou and watch her lightest sigh — thine own it will not be and bask beneath her sunny eye — it will not turn on thee ’ tis well the rack the chain the wheel far better hadst thou proved ev ’ n i could almost pity feel for thou art nor beloved
barbed wires on rusted nails can ’ t hold lone bulls at home when they smell pasture they thrust their bone skulls under barbs tongues quivering for a taste of strange and shove until the post gives way days later we find wires sagging reset the post and tighten bent wires like a fiddle and rope the worn-out bull wishing there was only a fence between us and our heart ’ s desire but something with spurs and a rope would find us cursing and yelling on horseback cutting us from escape down arroyos dragging us frothing and wild-eyed back to the sun-bleached yellow range the same whirlpool of buzzards
julia i bring to thee this ring made for thy finger fit to show by this that our love is or should be like to it close though it be the joint is free so when love ’ s yoke is on it must not gall or fret at all with hard oppression but it must play still either way and be too such a yoke as not too wide to overslide or be so strait to choke so we who bear this beam must rear ourselves to such a height as that the stay of either may create the burden light and as this round is nowhere found to flaw or else to sever so let our love as endless prove and pure as gold for ever
coming east we left the animals pelican beaver osprey muskrat and snake their hair and skin and feathers their eyes in the dark red and green your finger drawing my mouth blessed are they who remember that what they now have they once longed for a day a year ago last summer god filled me with himself like gold inside deeper inside than marrow this close to god this close to you walking into the river at wolf with the animals the snake ’ s green skin lit from inside our second life
after li po while my hair was still cut straight across my forehead i played about the front gate pulling flowers you came by on bamboo stilts playing horse you walked about my seat playing with blue plums and we went on living in the village of chōkan two small people without dislike or suspicion at fourteen i married my lord you i never laughed being bashful lowering my head i looked at the wall called to a thousand times i never looked back at fifteen i stopped scowling i desired my dust to be mingled with yours forever and forever and forever why should i climb the look out at sixteen you departed you went into far ku-tō-en by the river of swirling eddies and you have been gone five months the monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead you dragged your feet when you went out by the gate now the moss is grown the different mosses too deep to clear them away the leaves fall early this autumn in wind the paired butterflies are already yellow with august over the grass in the west garden they hurt me i grow older if you are coming down through the narrows of the river kiang please let me know beforehand and i will come out to meet you as far as chō-fū-sa
i felt both pleasure and a shiver as we undressed on the slippery bank and then plunged into the wild river i waded in she entered as a diver watching her pale flanks slice the dark i felt both pleasure and a shiver was this a source of the lake we sought giver of itself to that vast blue expanse we ’ d learn by plunging into the wild river and letting the current take us wherever it willed i had that yielding to thank for how i felt both pleasure and a shiver but what she felt and saw i ’ ll never know separate bodies taking the same risk by plunging together into the wild river later past the rapids we paused to consider if chance or destiny had brought us here whether it was more than pleasure and a shiver we ’ d found by plunging into the wild river
i went back as to my relatives when i arrived the elms had been shaved but you were all the same the buildings the dry classrooms i embraced your eyes your avenues you were fixed in the same expressions your flat voices your dental work like your lips slipping over words already said additional agricultural pamphlets many of you sat in private offices why did i think i could drag it all back the former edge of town where streets ended in fields under clouds puffed like the french phrases he kissed me with in the sucked-in breath of that illusive happiness coming back listening looking ready to take your bodies in my hands returning to streets that had poured heavy shopping malls over the hay-sweet grass where he and i lay whispering the most important nonsense of my desperate and embittered life
i will make you brooches and toys for your delight of bird-song at morning and star-shine at night i will make a palace fit for you and me of green days in forests and blue days at sea i will make my kitchen and you shall keep your room where white flows the river and bright blows the broom and you shall wash your linen and keep your body white in rainfall at morning and dewfall at night and this shall be for music when no one else is near the fine song for singing the rare song to hear that only i remember that only you admire of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire
love faded in my heart— i thought it was dead now new flowers start fresh leaves outspread why do these flowers upstart and again the leaves spread oh when will it be dead— this root that tears my heart
love in my bosom like a bee doth suck his sweet now with his wings he plays with me now with his feet within mine eyes he makes his nest his bed amidst my tender breast my kisses are his daily feast and yet he robs me of my rest ah wanton will ye and if i sleep then percheth he with pretty flight and makes his pillow of my knee the livelong night strike i my lute he tunes the string he music plays if so i sing he lends me every lovely thing yet cruel he my heart doth sting whist wanton still ye else i with roses every day will whip you hence and bind you when you long to play for your offense i ’ ll shut mine eyes to keep you in i ’ ll make you fast it for your sin i ’ ll count your power not worth a pin alas what hereby shall i win if he gainsay me what if i beat the wanton boy with many a rod he will repay me with annoy because a god then sit thou safely on my knee and let thy bower my bosom be lurk in mine eyes i like of thee o cupid so thou pity me spare not but play thee

a book of verses underneath the bough a jug of wine a loaf of bread—and thou beside me singing in the wilderness— oh wilderness were paradise enow
she stood breast high amid the corn clasped by the golden light of morn like the sweetheart of the sun who many a glowing kiss had won on her cheek an autumn flush deeply ripened —such a blush in the midst of brown was born like red poppies grown with corn round her eyes her tresses fell which were blackest none could tell but long lashes veiled a light that had else been all too bright and her hat with shady brim made her tressy forehead dim — thus she stood amid the stooks praising god with sweetest looks — sure i said heaven did not mean where i reap thou shouldst but glean lay thy sheaf adown and come share my harvest and my home

chekhov at yalta a winter evening at the cottage by the bay and i sat in the black and gold of the dead garden wrapped in blankets eating my sister ’ s suet pudding the fountain was wrapped in dirty straw and just below my property in the old tartar cemetery there was a small funeral in progress the widow is wearing a purple shawl the children are bare around the shoulders and the girls are wearing orange petals at their throats the ashen white beards of the men are like immaculate vests from this distance there is nothing more intolerable than suet pudding unless it is the visitors the drunken visitors laughing in my kitchen eating my duck and venison while i hide from them here in the dark garden the daughter of one of these gentlemen is pretty i saw her through the window drinking champagne from a clay mug—just under her thin blouse i saw the blue points of her breasts that turn in opposition both out and up like the azure slippers of the priest who is now singing in the cemetery below my house once the family has gone off with its torches i ’ ll climb down to the fresh grave and drop some coins for flowers even wooden teeth for the widow so she can attract a new husband the black turned soil or our garden reminds me of the common grave given to the children of the godunov orphanage after that horrible fire a charred horse was thrown in with them bags of lime and what i understood to be a large ham that the authorities nevertheless declared the torso of a male child of nine or ten the czar in their memory placed a tiny trout pond over them and this inscription a blue blanket for my little ones my wife goes nearly naked to parties in moscow my sister here at yalta goes sea bathing with a rope around her that runs back to the beach where it is attached to a donkey who is commanded by a servant with a long switch the sea tows her out and then the donkey is whipped sorrowfully until he has dragged her back to them i named the donkey moon after the mystery of his service to my sister this winter he has been an excellent friend i read to this poor beast from three sisters he is a better critic and audience than i could find in the cities i have won an award that will save me from arrest anywhere inside russia i am going to refuse it and then travel to nice or paris my tuberculosis is worse tolstoi reads my stories to his family after supper and reads them badly i suppose i did walk that evening all the way down to the cemetery only to discover that my pockets were empty i screamed up to the house for coins for plenty of coins the visitors laughing and singing ran down to me without coats and with a lantern swinging— my sister trailed behind them on her donkey her square black hat bobbing like a steamer way out in the bay and when they reached me— i said “ sister pack the trunks you hurt me i will write that we have departed for france for italy ”
i was ill lying on my bed of old papers when you came with white rabbits in your arms and the doves scattered upwards flying to mothers and the snails sighed under their baggage of stone now your tongue grows like celery between us because of our love-cries cabbage darkens in its nest the cauliflower thinks of her pale plump children and turns greenish-white in a light like the ocean ’ s i was sick fainting in the smell of teabags when you came with tomatoes a good poetry i am being wooed i am being conquered by a cliff of limestone that leaves chalk on my breasts
we rise from the snow where we ’ ve lain on our backs and flown like children from the imprint of perfect wings and cold gowns and we stagger together wine-breathed into town where our people are building their armies again short years after body bags after burnings there is a man i ’ ve come to love after thirty and we have our rituals of coffee of airports regret after love we smoke and sleep with magazines two shot glasses and the black and white collapse of hours in what time do we live that it is too late to have children in what place that we consider the various ways to leave there is no list long enough for a selective service card shriveling under a match the prison that comes of it a flag in the wind eaten from its pole and boys sent back in trash bags we ’ ll tell you you were at that time learning fractions we ’ ll tell you about fractions half of us are dead or quiet or lost let them speak for themselves we lie down in the fields and leave behind the corpses of angels
it is not that i love you less than when before your feet i lay but to prevent the sad increase of hopeless love i keep away in vain alas for everything which i have known belong to you your form does to my fancy bring and makes my old wounds bleed anew who in the spring from the new sun already has a fever got too late begins those shafts to shun which phœbus through his veins has shot too late he would the pain assuage and to thick shadows does retire about with him he bears the rage and in his tainted blood the fire but vow ’ d i have and never must your banish ’ d servant trouble you for if i break you may distrust the vow i made to love you too
william cut a hole in his levi ’ s pocket so he could flop himself out in class behind the girls so the other guys could see and shit what guts we all said all konga wanted to do over and over was the rubber band trick but he showed everyone how so nobody wanted to see anymore and one day he cried just cried until his parents took him away forever maya had a hotpoint refrigerator standing in his living room just for his family to show anybody who came that they could afford it me i got a french kiss finally in the catholic darkness my tongue ’ s farthest half vacationing loudly in another mouth like a man in bermudas and my body jumped against a flagstone wall i could feel it through her thin almost nonexistent body i had at that moment that moment a hot girl on a summer night the best of all the things we tried to do well she let me kiss her anyway all over or it was just a flagstone wall with a flaw in the stone an understanding cavity for burning young men with smooth dreams— the true circumstance is gone the true circumstances about us all then are gone but when i kissed her all water she would close her eyes and they into somewhere would disappear whether she was there or not i remember her clearly and she moves around the room sometimes until i sleep i have lain on the desert in watch low in the back of a pick-up truck for nothing in particular for stars for the things behind stars and nothing comes more than the moment always now here in a truck the moment again to dream of making love and sweat this time to a woman or even to all of them in some allowable way to those boys then who couldn ’ t cry to the girls before they were women to friends me on my back the sky over me pressing its simple weight into her body on me into the bodies of them all on me
to the dim light and the large circle of shade i have clomb and to the whitening of the hills there where we see no color in the grass natheless my longing loses not its green it has so taken root in the hard stone which talks and hears as though it were a lady utterly frozen is this youthful lady even as the snow that lies within the shade for she is no more moved than is the stone by the sweet season which makes warm the hills and alters them afresh from white to green covering their sides again with flowers and grass when on her hair she sets a crown of grass the thought has no more room for other lady because she weaves the yellow with the green so well that love sits down there in the shade – love who has shut me in among low hills faster than between walls of granite-stone she is more bright than is a precious stone the wound she gives may not be healed with grass i therefore have fled far o ’ er plains and hills for refuge from so dangerous a lady but from her sunshine nothing can give shade – not any hill nor wall nor summer-green a while ago i saw her dressed in green – so fair she might have wakened in a stone this love which i do feel even for her shade and therefore as one woos a graceful lady i wooed her in a field that was all grass girdled about with very lofty hills yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills before love ’ s flame in this damp wood and green burn as it burns within a youthful lady for my sake who would sleep away in stone my life or feed like beasts upon the grass only to see her garments cast a shade how dark soe ’ er the hills throw out their shade under her summer green the beautiful lady covers it like a stone cover ’ d in grass

a girl who in 1971 when i was living by myself painfully lonely bereft depressed offhandedly mentioned to me in a conversation with some friends that although at first she ’ d found me— i can ’ t remember the term some dated colloquialism signifying odd unacceptable out-of-things— she ’ d decided that i was after all all right ... twelve years later she comes back to me from nowhere and i realize that it wasn ’ t my then irrepressible unselective incessant sexual want she meant which when we ’ d been introduced i ’ d naturally aimed at her and which she ’ d easily deflected but that she ’ d thought i really was in myself the way i looked and spoke and acted what she was saying creepy weird whatever and i am taken with a terrible humiliation
she lay all naked in her bed and i myself lay by no veil but curtains about her spread no covering but i her head upon her shoulders seeks to hang in careless wise and full of blushes was her cheeks and of wishes were her eyes her blood still fresh into her face as on a message came to say that in another place it meant another game her cherry lip moist plump and fair millions of kisses crown which ripe and uncropped dangle there and weigh the branches down her breasts that welled so plump and high bred pleasant pain in me for all the world i do defy the like felicity her thighs and belly soft and fair to me were only shown to have seen such meat and not to have eat would have angered any stone her knees lay upward gently bent and all lay hollow under as if on easy terms they meant to fall unforced asunder just so the cyprian queen did lie expecting in her bower when too long stay had kept the boy beyond his promised hour ‘ dull clown ’ quoth she ‘ why dost delay such proffered bliss to take canst thou find out no other way similitudes to make ’ mad with delight i thundering throw my arms about her but pox upon ’ t ’ twas but a dream and so i lay without her
farm boys wild to couple with anything with soft-wooded trees with mounds of earth mounds of pinestraw will keep themselves off animals by legends of their own in the hay-tunnel dark and dung of barns they will say i have heard tell that in a museum in atlanta way back in a corner somewhere there ’ s this thing that ’ s only half sheep like a woolly baby pickled in alcohol because those things can ’ t live his eyes are open but you can ’ t stand to look i heard from somebody who ... but this is now almost all gone the boys have taken their own true wives in the city the sheep are safe in the west hill pasture but we who were born there still are not sure are we because we remember remembered in the terrible dust of museums merely with his eyes the sheep-child may be saying saying i am here in my father ’ s house i who am half of your world came deeply to my mother in the long grass of the west pasture where she stood like moonlight listening for foxes it was something like love from another world that seized her from behind and she gave not lifting her head out of dew without ever looking her best self to that great need turned loose she dipped her face farther into the chill of the earth and in a sound of sobbing of something stumbling away began as she must do to carry me i woke dying in the summer sun of the hillside with my eyes far more than human i saw for a blazing moment the great grassy world from both sides man and beast in the round of their need and the hill wind stirred in my wool my hoof and my hand clasped each other i ate my one meal of milk and died staring from dark grass i came straight to my father ’ s house whose dust whirls up in the halls for no reason when no one comes piling deep in a hellish mild corner and through my immortal waters i meet the sun ’ s grains eye to eye and they fail at my closet of glass dead i am most surely living in the minds of farm boys i am he who drives them like wolves from the hound bitch and calf and from the chaste ewe in the wind they go into woods into bean fields they go deep into their known right hands dreaming of me they groan they wait they suffer themselves they marry they raise their kind

the lad came to the door at night when lovers crown their vows and whistled soft and out of sight in shadow of the boughs ‘ i shall not vex you with my face henceforth my love for aye so take me in your arms a space before the east is grey ‘ when i from hence away am past i shall not find a bride and you shall be the first and last i ever lay beside. ’ she heard and went and knew not why her heart to his she laid light was the air beneath the sky but dark under the shade ‘ oh do you breathe lad that your breast seems not to rise and fall and here upon my bosom prest there beats no heart at all ’ ‘ oh loud my girl it once would knock you should have felt it then but since for you i stopped the clock it never goes again. ’ ‘ oh lad what is it lad that drips wet from your neck on mine what is it falling on my lips my lad that tastes of brine ’ ‘ oh like enough ’ tis blood my dear for when the knife has slit the throat across from ear to ear ’ twill bleed because of it ’

the nights have grown cool again like the nights of early spring and quiet again will speech disturb you we're alone now we have no reason for silence can you see over the garden—the full moon rises i wo n't see the next full moon in spring when the moon rose it meant time was endless snowdrops opened and closed the clustered seeds of the maples fell in pale drifts white over white the moon rose over the birch tree and in the crook where the tree divides leaves of the first daffodils in moonlight soft greenish-silver we have come too far together toward the end now to fear the end these nights i am no longer even certain i know what the end means and you who 've been with a man— after the first cries does n't joy like fear make no sound
since there is no escape since at the end my body will be utterly destroyed this hand i love as i have loved a friend this body i tended wept with and enjoyed since there is no escape even for me who love life with a love too sharp to bear the scent of orchards in the rain the sea and hours alone too still and sure for prayer— since darkness waits for me then all the more let me go down as waves sweep to the shore in pride and let me sing with my last breath in these few hours of light i lift my head life is my lover—i shall leave the dead if there is any way to baffle death
some seventy years later your father sitting at your table over wine he savors last rays mellow- ing in it recalls his favorite aunt rifka “ just naming her shoots rifles off again inside the morning square rifles she aimed into the air for certain customers the pigeons erupting. ” handsome clever but with little actual schooling she a jewess kept a shop in moscow stocking horse- and battle-gear bustling all day long powders braided with his laboring breath still prickle inside his nostrils like the wayward flickers cast by lazily swimming naked limbs leathers polished buckles gleam and the oats banked in their bins heavy august winds drowsed in them at one glance a single sniffing bloom the harnesses and bells by gaslight starred send out appeals while sleighs collect for midnight junkets he smitten with it all like those officers of the czar who admiring her wit her seasoned gaiety forever jammed the shop “ even the city ’ s metropolitan young despite his full black robes took to dropping in on her his jagged bushy beard awag with chat one balmy summer evening i remember the three of us laughter brimming like wine he turned his glass to the lessened light relaxed in her snug flat the next morning at breakfast talk going on as if we ’ d never stop ” — he a startled look lit on his face breaking in upon himself exclaims the pigeons crackling through the air— “ my god he spent the night with her ” he sipping the last drop sits back as much as he ’ s amazed amused to see this special virtue of old age the oats ripening only in slow time
slow slow fresh fount keep time with my salt tears yet slower yet o faintly gentle springs list to the heavy part the music bears woe weeps out her division when she sings droop herbs and flowers fall grief in showers our beauties are not ours o i could still like melting snow upon some craggy hill drop drop drop drop since nature ’ s pride is now a withered daffodil
to say screw them to be screw-them bent on one thing all but lost one music or mystery beyond all the necessary incidental snaggings of the heart to train the whole soul ’ s beam on a solitary hill or on it a special kind of rock or creeper to be sated just by saxophone to want nothing but your eyes lifelong to study scottish otters the snub slippery-whiskered snout the way they intertwine in threes at play indistinguishably bound long sleek backs submerging away ... to make of this your being ’ s aim its joy and know by pulse and viscus the word joy no gifts but thine to thyself thou canst if thou list single out make good one wish this from the dumb lips of an old god who with one endless misty hand holds out to us too much to love and with the other—crooked-fingered crazed with veins—some nights and days
sometimes with one i love i fill myself with rage for fear i effuse unreturn ’ d love but now i think there is no unreturn ’ d love the pay is certain one way or another i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return ’ d yet out of that i have written these songs
somewhere or other there must surely be the face not seen the voice not heard the heart that not yet—never yet—ah me made answer to my word somewhere or other may be near or far past land and sea clean out of sight beyond the wandering moon beyond the star that tracks her night by night somewhere or other may be far or near with just a wall a hedge between with just the last leaves of the dying year fallen on a turf grown green
overture more loudly to inveigh against your absence raising the volume by at least a third humbly i say i ’ ve written this immense astonishing “ sonata ” word by word with leitmotivs you ’ ll wish you ’ d never heard and a demented shattering cadenza i ’ m pained to say that scholarship insists cadenzas are conclusion to concertos not sonatas—true sonatas close with what pedantic musicologists waving their ph.d.s beneath my nose persist in calling recapitulation my double ending is a variation i couldn ’ t choose between them once i chose to write two endings so because i wrote a recapitulation and cadenza my piece concludes two times—and then it ends again because i ’ ve added on a coda to brush up on sonata structure first the exposition sounds two melodies deeply dissimilar in different keys major and minor part two is a burst of brainstorms scholars call development in which the two themes of the exposition are changed and rearranged past recognition distorted fragmented dissolved and blent into chromatic superimposition till imperceptibly two themes unite and then if everything is going right the piece concludes in recapitulation exposition theme one my life lacks what in lacking you theme two does the material world exist ideally your neurons should resist as yet connecting numbers one and two but note the skill the frightening mastery the lunatic precision it entails to merge these separate themes the way train rails converge as they approach infinity development i dreamed that an encyclopedia opened before my eyes and there i found analogies to sort of stack around my what-is-life-without-you-here idea like nous detached from anaxagoras like cosmic fire glimmering without a heraclitus there to find it out like square roots waiting for pythagoras like one-ness riven from parmenides like nothing without gorgias to detect it like paradox sans zeno to perfect it like plural worlds lacking empedocles like plato ’ s chairs and tables if you took the furniture ’ s eternal forms away objects abandoned by reality still look the same but look the way things look when i behold my life without you in it a screwy room where chairs and tables lack dimension from the front the side the back like finity without the infinite where tea parties are held without the hatter it ’ s like a single point withdrawn from space it ’ s like a physicist who can not trace the ultimate constituents of matter— there is no evidence matter exists thus do i introduce theme number two and i can ’ t prove it but i know it ’ s true the physical eludes the physicists they ’ ve chased down matter past atomic rings into small shadows and they ’ ve lost it there it seems that they can ’ t find it anywhere they stalk imaginary floating things like amateurish lepidopterists round babbling brooks and mossy fairy knolls their net strings map out squares of empty holes behold them snatching something in their fists their fingers uncurl cautious on the sight of nothing crushed against the sweaty hand but then i ’ m prejudiced you understand not everyone on earth believes i ’ m right but lest you think i ’ m kidding or perverse i went to hear a lecture just last year about some things which i hold very dear the smallest pieces of the universe the lecturer referred to them as quarks he seemed impervious to the mystery surrounding their invisibility i asked when he concluded his remarks “ but are quarks physical ” you ’ d think that he were someone nearly martyred and i ’ d said our duty ’ s to die peacefully in bed he took his glasses off and blinked at me were i john milton i would now destroy this moment of high drama and deploy a thirty-line homeric simile but i ’ m not milton nor was meant to be he put his glasses on

of thee kind boy i ask no red and white to make up my delight no odd becoming graces black eyes or little know-not-whats in faces make me but mad enough give me good store of love for her i count i ask no more ’ tis love in love that makes the sport there ’ s no such thing as that we beauty call it is mere cozenage all for though some long ago liked certain colors mingled so and so that doth not tie me now from choosing new if i a fancy take to black and blue that fancy doth it beauty make ’ tis not the meat but ’ tis the appetite makes eating a delight and if i like one dish more than another that a pheasant is what in our watches that in us is found so to the height and nick we up be wound no matter by what hand or trick

first time he kissed me he but only kissed the fingers of this hand wherewith i write and ever since it grew more clean and white ... slow to world-greetings ... quick with its “ oh list ” when the angels speak a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss the second passed in height the first and sought the forehead and half missed half falling on the hair o beyond meed that was the chrism of love which love ’ s own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said “ my love my own ”
beloved thou hast brought me many flowers plucked in the garden all the summer through and winter and it seemed as if they grew in this close room nor missed the sun and showers so in the like name of that love of ours take back these thoughts which here unfolded too and which on warm and cold days i withdrew from my heart ’ s ground indeed those beds and bowers be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue and wait thy weeding yet here ’ s eglantine here ’ s ivy — take them as i used to do thy flowers and keep them where they shall not pine instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true and tell thy soul their roots are left in mine
i lift my heavy heart up solemnly as once electra her sepulchral urn and looking in thine eyes i overturn the ashes at thy feet behold and see what a great heap of grief lay hid in me and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn through the ashen greyness if thy foot in scorn could tread them out to darkness utterly it might be well perhaps but if instead thou wait beside me for the wind to blow the grey dust up ... those laurels on thine head o my beloved will not shield thee so that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred the hair beneath stand further off then go

toward dying my iliacus from which orchids bloom would learn to take an infant ’ s shape some premature creature weaned too soon my femoral nerve from which lichen grows in many shades would learn to

anything could summon it — a breaking in cloud cover wind chimes catching salt outside my mother ’ s window a corner of a painting and i learned how to call it too this is the only skill of which i have ever been proud when my sister died from the head of my visio came offspring in the thousands armed to the teeth each its own vessel my first their mother lived on for itself and its hoard it found a permanent home in a cave at the bottom of a lake and it waited until i was standing on a mountain to sing to me you will call this mountain home until i tell you to move again there will always be more of it underground than you will ever see with your eye and so it turned out to be true and so when i stood on the mountain that became my home i beheld a dirt sea and saw our moon which has two faces i learned that one face of our moon is dappled with maria and that the sunbeams here are newborns that lie on each other purpling into the fog and outstretched pines the earth spins masses of air until it looks like one of many irises studding our galaxy from space parts of the atlantic look like leather wrinkled and dark and others look like iridescent fishes in an old master ’ s painting of the sky i live in the valley of a crater here where steam rises like ghosts in the summer heat this mountain is made of igneous stone every day i issue a warning to lovers darlings i have in my possession a dead girl deer her head is draped over my right shoulder i hold her with one arm encircling her torso you wake each morning with flowers shrouding your body like a corpse i put them there to me you died when my legs curved around your head one of the deer ’ s eyes has blackened and her tongue is thick she belonged to my sister o my sister you were twenty-four listen close even to this part especially this i want you to hear what i say to lovers because i want to sing to you who died a virgin a few treatises on love and sex — how flesh and ecstasy are born what they make how they live out their days as a bodied girl you feared me and i met your fear with guttural disdain i imagine you wondered what it would take for me to hear a mortal human voice whenever you spoke a vessel came for me chattering like some frail and hissing bird pigeon-chested thin-veined feet sister i don ’ t listen to lovers either who i call by the same names that were yours dear beloved but spirits are not like their progenitors their touches can range texturally from velvet to bristle lover each time i kiss you i name after you a sickly feeling in my own body as if each ailing is a previously undiscovered moon orbiting a planet that can only sustain the strangest of life-forms sister i know neither goodness nor mercy shall follow me all the days of my life as surely that i know the beasts i inherit or create of all unions familial or otherwise are speechless and brute and bound to die soon yes there is much to love about the body too there is much to hate i cast off care for pleasure and for labor teaching my body over time that these things can ’ t coexist i fear it has started to believe me my body has never sought wholeness the way yours did sister it was always still the dull twilight of early morning with us you were twenty-four and when you died i stopped fearing arson when i picture us as girls we are at the base of the mountain from my visio divining the summit as we diminish into spots of light we are without parentage on my mountaintop in midafternoons flocks of wheeling birds gather around the crescent moon when the moon worms its way through the clouds it fixes its eyes on me and sings a song that says we live our lives chained to earth and that when we die the flesh falls off our bones so our bones can turn into the driest of riverbed dirt sister when you died your bones cast an enchantment we made a powder of them and i named the powder ash because ash is a word with neither origin nor afterlife and its definition is the look a doe gets when she ’ s been away from her herd too long when a person goes missing and we don ’ t know her name we grant her the surname doe with this christening we name all missing persons part of the family of ash which has no family sometimes i think that each speck of ash previously named priya hums on quiet nights in a frequency only the other pieces can hear inaudible to the waking world she hums to herself that hum is how my blood became blue in lieu of oxygen my body began to breathe in only the vibrations of the hum blood has to be born into its colors or more precisely it has to die into them in hesiod ’ s theogony nyx is born of chaos erebus gaia and tartarus are her siblings hesiod couldn ’ t decide whether nyx birthed the fates or whether the fates were born of someone else but he knew that nyx ’ s children whoever they were had no sire about nyx ’ s brothers and sisters hesiod writes earth too and great oceanus and dark night the holy race of all the other deathless ones that are for ever and one day — what tell me tell me the song they taught you tell me how you learned how beautiful nyx is how you realized zeus feared her and how you first saw that within her every star from the swollen to the hollow from the living to the dead is visible powered by little but her peerless face when i returned north for the first time since my father turned my sister into a powder named ash a word born of nothing and with no children i heard her from a seagull on the ferry i rode from the harbor to the cape out of a piping plover on the dunes in a crow ’ s call on the highway from boston to gloucester past folly ’ s cove prides crossing rust island then from my station again on the mountain i heard my own voice from a brown thrasher that night i drove through remains of a fresh accident on the mountain highway the dropping sun lit my back as if heralding fire a dislocated red front bumper straddled the median singing a song nyx was in the wind and her siblings and they bade me sing too like hesiod had asked grant lovely song celebrate the holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever born of earth and starry heaven and gloomy night and them that briny sea did rear soon all were singing the median sang with the deep voice of a woman who knows how to sing scat and the mountain standing like a moon on earth responded with a wordless song of its own creation ash sang dirt sang to them i lent a melody which is one of the things i do when i can ’ t sleep the secret about lullabies when they work it ’ s because they sound like something plants would sing in hades on the banks of the river dark oh how i wish they worked on me when the sculptor couldn ’ t sleep she drew mountains they were pink red ridged and pulsing and rose from valleys of blue or else she ’ d draw eyes that held too many irises or wombs that bore sweet cysts or spindle-legged women with outsized drooping breasts ill-formed and misshapen eyes for nipples uneven halos for areolae made of the same skin as the kind under eyes that have been open for too long those songs i sing when i can ’ t sleep are directed to my army of visios in return they give me images of myself as different creatures gibbons a chicken with a plucked-feather neck an asteroid a mountain a volcano with the thinnest most translucent shell me as some fantastical beast with eyes lining the inside of my body watching my diaphragm turn into the ocean i saw from the ferry watching plumes of sun flare over it as it comes to resemble a dead animal ’ s long-weathered skin ghostly ships with dropped anchors materialize to trawl it and squadrons of men dismount searching for new blooms in terra mountainous and lush my heart is a sky embalmed and bright when the phantoms drop anchor there to welcome their sailors are screaming pelicans on the rocks and parades continually wheeling of ugly vultures in funereal garb in their eyes the atlantic always looks besieged by hurricane lunar maria means moon seas but when i hear it i picture horses torqued female beasts who live on the moon and whose manes are made of the roots of moon-trees i did not want to die but i wanted to want death none of you ever knew how badly i have practiced at it at times i rehearsed like a dancer surrounded by mirrored walls at others i moonlighted with movies set on battlefields and abattoirs pausing and rewinding until i could mimic the motions of actresses who succumb to unexpected poison or shove knives into their bellies or fall like brueghel ’ s boy i pretended i was standing in a castle dressed like a samurai looking through a barred window knowing the trees approaching held a promise so annihilative my flesh would have no choice but to accept i pictured jumping from the top of the mountain and i sang love it love it love it on my mountain the birds shroud the pines and the pines make a spectral outline against the valley of nyx ’ s body one afternoon here a man said to his son all this has to do with eons of time water over and over just cutting and cutting the rock from where i stand on its summit i can touch the big dipper and i can see its children and another peak shaped like the back of a horse it is shadow blue the same blue as the dying sky to the big dipper and her children i sing a song that asks if they are safe and tells them that on forest floors dappled things of glass and light grow from knotted roots sister could i find you on that horse mountain i wonder if i want to have i made this world lover a confession if i found my sister on any mountain i would gather her in my arms and take her from its back singing lullabies or else i ’ d take an arrow laced with a drug i ’ d made special for her and standing close push it in her unarmed right flank instead of how to die i ended up studying how to kill but the sculptor she asked nothing of her dead out of visions of them she made formidable metal spiders she named maman maman maman maman maman maman who live after the sculptor has died have all lost children like my mother their domains are terrors — land-terrors water-terrors terrors of the open sky their hearts are war- grief terrors of trees in the joyless forest of portent sometimes in their homes are fires on floods dire wonders their children were all named doe which means that the plural form for children of maman is deer for a long time i hated the phrase i am sorry for your loss i lost nothing my sister died but loss is less of a euphemism than its users want to lose means both to have been defeated and to misplace maman maman maman also answers to demeter demeter demeter sister i could stop no one from taking your head although i promise you i fought for it hand-to-hand by the mouth of the bone-house one day on my mountain i got to thinking about those other peaks from a cave underwater i heard find them like flowers strange and never before seen and so it became true i found mountains covered in smoke-thick fogs and mountains that lied — those were barely hills and then i found them what the mountains in my visio would have looked like had it been summer in that land summer brought some changes my body had no orchids or lichen and the crown was not of diamonds but the reek of sewage wafting over a field — a prairie almost — from which rose tens of signal towers all blinking red the base of mountains was when i got there still and in darkness it was a sky in which every child of every star living or dead could be heard humming the peerless face of the mountain was cragged rock dust rock shadow rock i stayed until day to watch the birth of a sunbeam so i could then see it age later in the day an immense heat came like another bone-house i climbed the ridges which turned to colored ringlets of cloud and ash at the slightest pressure sunrise and sunset were scant minutes of shadow-play the prairie grass ’ s rustle each blade sang in a different language there i learned the names of four of the lunar mares catfire osiris blood oath and early morning this is who i am i harbor secret loves and i do secret work catfire osiris blood oath and early morning are teaching me how to finally chart a course through time how to carve journeys in space they descended from their moon to the crags followed me home to my moonlike mountain lover my body — you won ’ t be able to keep up with it soon you ’ ll have to leave it you ’ ll have to leave me or else i ’ ll leave you because my body it invents definitions for the word sadness like noun the feathers on a bird ’ s back you ’ ll do nothing for me on my mountain it ’ s midafternoon and the wheeling birds are landing steadily even though no stable ground is here to be found when they sing it is a song that i who know no prayers imagine to be gospel a man comes up the mountainside and sings along with them as he walks in circles on the rock robbed sister was your breath robbed lover is yours too sister i wish you could know this feeling if sung perfectly pressure on each nerve cluster can make bones irrelevant whether those bones are living or dead whether they are ash or dirt at the base of my mountain is a lake where creatures go to die water slides into their spiracles and fills their tracheae their tracheae stretch into bellows fit to extinguish the fires in any volcano when my body showed me sadness and began there to outline and diagram the word another definition was noun a chorus of brass instruments like upward-turned mouths forged of metal and another was verb to shake like chimes flanking a rock-hewn shore barely alive and almost imperceptible for a flash sometimes i picture my sister underneath one of the sculptor ’ s spiders her head barely reaches the first joint on the spider ’ s leg and when she looks up she thinks that the whole sky is the spider ’ s stomach maman she says i am hungry food food i am hungry she runs her shrunken finger from one tagma to another her stroke makes lava run faster in all the volcanoes within the tectonic plate on which she lives and she unawares suckles at every ridge she can find she rests both palms flat against the metal closes her eyes and cries what would the world look like with enough lava to fill the atlantic i know that the earth ’ s temperature has risen and i know that all of its ice will melt i know there will be no more purple from the sun that the spider ’ s iron underside is one of the few things that like my mother does not sing at the lake today is a flock of feral cats though they ’ re in front of me their song comes from below so although i can see them i picture them swimming in a river that separates mortals from the planet ’ s heart in this river floats the phantom of a dead doe listen to me now darlings my sister did not live long enough to see the moon turn red but i did and despite those who wish otherwise myself included i will see it again sadness ’ s fourth definition is conjunction bees forests of them devotional and thick enough to knot together human dreams or human bodies even when ghostly or lovelorn the underground river gives me no passage despite my dreams of the phantom that dropped anchor somewhere and of its amassed pelicans and vultures each ghost is filled to the brim with flowers whose scents describe the places they were born just like mine does no matter how hard i try to cloak it on the top of my mountain a man says to a woman i like how there ’ s just trees trees trees trees she replies each time she says the word her voice makes a new species i recently tried another way to die could i fall from a tower filled wall-to-wall with twenty-four thousand living flowers each planted in the soil covering the tower ’ s floors six inches deep the flowers would have heavy-branched spikes for blooms and would release a powerful smell of bone marrow and spew a pollen that fills the air until it becomes oppressive when i opened my mouth to sing of this instead of a sound my mouth expelled gnats and fog which is what a spider ’ s milk is made of the word nyx tastes like sister and means both night and flower i worry i won ’ t rest again do you know how a naked titan looks sister he ’ s swarmed with shadow but he holds light deep in his stomach like an electric secret dear love i can ’ t give you what you need from me all i ’ ll do is take after my sister died i learned she always wanted a warm island garlands draped around her neck there was no mountain in her vision instead in it she was singing what she imagined was an island song in a language i don ’ t know she was dancing badly and breathing with great labor on burnished sands sand bores me sister i need rock and high altitude when i am cold i hear wolves i think they live in the carillon beside the mountain ’ s lake sister it was always true that i would outlive you i know exactly how many times my family wished me dead don ’ t look up says a child on the top of my mountain it makes you want to fall it will always be still the dull twilight of early morning with us this is one of the curses of living in the end my visio alone will sing and dance breathing heavily every day the sunbeams in it turn a brighter pink dears beloveds all of you your blood is bewitched and bade to move into places it wasn ’ t meant to go steeped deeply in poisons it can ’ t purge you share the look on your face with all the others whether deer child or man if you look deeply enough into any other pair of eyes your heart valves start to change allegiances your body ’ s lakes fill with the other ’ s want until all you want in turn is what the other wants which rises in you like seawater there are species of flowers and invasive weeds that live only in another ’ s gaze whether lovelorn hate-filled hopeless or hungry i am looking into your eyes right now and in my mind are two girl deer sisters with thin-hooved legs steady digging into grass they disappear into the woods which are part of a forest in a painting when the novelist saw this painting he thought that there he could see men turning into birds and birds turning into men and those same men turning then into sea creatures and then back into birds from this final change scales and tentacles would linger on their backs as they wheeled through the air as would the dream of filling their lungs with the sea for which they would ache the definition of deer is lost the definition of beloved is dissolution on the top of my mountain i hear a mother call to a faceless child where are you the chattering and thin voice of a boy from the top of a tree cries back in the woods and then beguilingly come into the woods around the orbs of light in the forest that i still don ’ t know if the dipper ’ s children can see new trees grow beside the pines elms birches willows one strange western juniper each creature in this forest was once something or someone else — the novelist was right the top of one of the elms is a sprig of radiant blood sister i was very young when i found out you were cloven-hooved i did what i could i want to say that you can trust me that i am listening to you and that you can speak to me and that i will speak to you at last tell me about the beasts that got you the beasts who carry me when i am too weak to carry my deer alone are catfire osiris blood oath and early morning i would like to believe that i carry this deer for you that i ’ ll be able to tell you what it feels like to have a hungry mouth on your lip or nipple i want to say sister i promise but the definition of myth is noun the idea that any one creature can ever hear another and while i beguile you to betray yourself to me like lovers do in their sleep i am lying to you no death did not bring this to us it has always been true i sister am a selfish woman and you sister were a mute one my body invents words and swells with prophecies its effort shows in insect bites and rashes that don ’ t heal in my peeled hands bleeding groin wistful gut misaligned jaw mole-like left eye lump-riddled womb dears beloveds you ’ ve been asleep a long time but we all return to the waking world someday and when you do at last come back you will find me spent and alone ugly wounded ungrateful ill. shaking and calling to you for aid loveless without a soul or even the memory of pleasure the last lover to desert me will deem me rancid the last thing i hear my sister ’ s voice from will be dirt of the mares i will have left only early morning who won ’ t know that i will soon take her hide turn it into an ocean that will at last cleave open my skull
this is exactly the kind of space i want to follow you into holding your little mute worm on a twig make it marble make it touch like tough winter in the next life we will have longer love better places with extended embraces now we leave the song to return to the front leaf closing on closeness of mothers in the next world overseeing premium waste of the planet reincarnate anywhere but here land on a different rim
he slips on ice near a mailbox — no gemsbok leaps across the road — a singer tapped an eagle feather on his shoulders — women washed indigo-dyed yarn in this river but today gallium and germanium particles are washed downstream — once they dynamited dikes to slow advancing troops — picking psilocybin mushrooms and hearing cowbells in the mist — as a child he was tied to a sheep and escaped marauding soldiers — an apple blossom opens to five petals — as he hikes up a switchback he remembers undressing her — from the train window he saw they were on ladders cutting fruit off cacti — in the desert a crater of radioactive glass — assembling shards he starts to repair a gray bowl with gold lacquer — they ate psilocybin mushrooms gazed at the pond undressed — hunting a turkey in the brush he stops — from the ponderosa pines whoo-ah whoo whoo whoo —
oh come to me in dreams my love i will not ask a dearer bliss come with the starry beams my love and press mine eyelids with thy kiss ’ twas thus as ancient fables tell love visited a grecian maid till she disturbed the sacred spell and woke to find her hopes betrayed but gentle sleep shall veil my sight and psyche ’ s lamp shall darkling be when in the visions of the night thou dost renew thy vows to me then come to me in dreams my love i will not ask a dearer bliss come with the starry beams my love and press mine eyelids with thy kiss
my sweet did sweetly sleep and on her rosy face stood tears of pearl which beauty ’ s self did weep i wond ’ ring at her grace did all amaz ’ d remain when love said “ fool can looks thy wishes crown time past comes not again. ” then did i me bow down and kissing her fair breast lips cheeks and eyes prov ’ d here on earth the joys of paradise
thyrsis a youth of the inspired train fair sacharissa lov ’ d but lov ’ d in vain like phœbus sung the no less amorous boy like daphne she as lovely and as coy with numbers he the flying nymph pursues with numbers such as phœbus ’ self might use such is the chase when love and fancy leads o ’ er craggy mountains and through flow ’ ry meads invok ’ d to testify the lover ’ s care or form some image of his cruel fair urg ’ d with his fury like a wounded deer o ’ er these he fled and now approaching near had reach ’ d the nymph with his harmonious lay whom all his charms could not incline to stay yet what he sung in his immortal strain though unsuccessful was not sung in vain all but the nymph that should redress his wrong attend his passion and approve his song like phœbus thus acquiring unsought praise he catch ’ d at love and fill ’ d his arm with bays
she turned to gold and fell in love she danced life upside down she opened her wild eyes again and asked some strangers in the strangers felt her in and out they found her outsides thin since her heart was still and hard they knocked her insides in
leaves flare up kitchen matches in the permanent trees black flash of pike on mirror lake dropping like a roll of nickels i don ’ t want nudes in paintings i don ’ t want beauty through the heart small harpoon that opens when pulled out i want to break another eggroll with you in moonlight ugly maples when you ’ re gone
for m.b the answer is entropy—how smell works— little bits of everything—always spinning off from where they were—flying off at random into the world—which is to say into air there are other ways of solid to gas— they ’ re substance specific like iodine or dry ice—how i felt when i saw you— straight to a new state without passing through expected ones—as though enough of me left at the moment you appeared that i could never be whole without you—apply heat—i turn straight into ether
was he then adam of the burning way hid away in the heat like wrath conceald in love ’ s face or the seed eris in eros key and lock of what i was i could not speak the releasing word for into a dark matter he came and askt me to say what i could not say “ i .. ” all the flame in me stopt against my tongue my heart was a stone a dumb unmanageable thing in me a darkness that stood athwart his need for the enlightening the “ i love you ” that has only this one quick in time this one start when its moment is true such is the sickness of many a good thing that now into my life from long ago this refusing to say i love you has bound the weeping the yielding the yearning to be taken again into a knot a waiting a string so taut it taunts the song it resists the touch it grows dark to draw down the lover ’ s hand from its lightness to what ’ s underground

you politely ask me not to die and i promise not to right from the beginning—a relationship based on good sense and thoughtfulness in little things i would like to be loved for such simple attainments as breathing regularly and not falling down too often or because my eyes are brown or my father left-handed and to be on the safe side i wouldn ’ t mind if somehow i became entangled in your perception of admirable objects so you might say to yourself i have recently noticed how superbly situated the empire state building is how it looms up suddenly behind cemeteries and rivers so far away you could touch it—therefore i love you part of me fears that some moron is already plotting to tear down the empire state building and replace it with a block of staten island mother/daughter houses just as part of me fears that if you love me for my cleanliness i will grow filthy if you admire my elegant clothes i ’ ll start wearing shirts with sailboats on them but i have decided to become a public beach an opera house a regularly scheduled flight—something that can ’ t help being in the right place at the right time—come take your seat we ’ ll raise the curtain fill the house start the engines fly off into the sunrise the spire of the empire state the last sight on the horizon as the earth begins to curve
surprised by joy—impatient as the wind i turned to share the transport—oh with whom but thee long buried in the silent tomb that spot which no vicissitude can find love faithful love recalled thee to my mind— but how could i forget thee —through what power even for the least division of an hour have i been so beguiled as to be blind to my most grievous loss —that thought ’ s return was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore save one one only when i stood forlorn knowing my heart ’ s best treasure was no more that neither present time nor years unborn could to my sight that heavenly face restore

you might as well take a razor to your pecker as let a woman in your heart first they do the wash and then they kill you they flash their lights and teach your wallet to puke they bring it to you folded—if you see her stepping between the coin laundry and your building over the slushy street and watch the clothing steam you can ’ t wait to open up the door when she puts the stairs behind her and catch that warmth between you it changes into a baby “ here ’ s to the little shitter the little linoleum lizard. ” once he peed on me when i was changing him—that one got a laugh from the characters i wasted all my chances with at popeye ’ s establishment when it was over by the wonderland but it ’ s destroyed now and i understand one of those shopping malls that are like great monuments of blindness and folly stands there and next door the grimy restaurants of men with movies where they used to wear human faces the sad people from space but that was never me because everything in those days depended on my work “ listen i ’ m going to work ” was all i could say and drunk or sober i would put on the uniform of texaco and wade into my life i felt like a man of honor and substance but the situation was dancing underneath me— once i walked into the living room at my sister ’ s and saw that the two of them her and my sister had turned sometime behind my back not exactly fatter but heavy or squalid with cartoons moving across the television in front of them surrounded by laundry and a couple of coca-colas standing up next to the iron on the board i stepped out into the yard of bricks and trash and watched the light light up the blood inside each leaf and i asked myself now what is the rpm on this mother where do you turn it on i think you understand how i felt i ’ m not saying everything changed in the space of one second of seeing two women but i did start dragging her into the clubs with me i insisted she be sexy i just wanted to live and i did some nights were so sensory i felt the starlight landing on my back and i believed i could set fire to things with my fingers— but the strategies of others broke my promise at closing time once she kept talking to a man when i was trying to catch her attention to leave it was a negro man and i thought of black limousines and black masses and black hydrants filled with black water when the lights came on you could see all kinds of intentions in the air i thought i might smack her face or spill a glass but instead i opened him up with my red fishing knife and i took out his guts and i said “ here they are motherfucker nigger here they are. ” there were people frozen around us the lights had just come on at that moment i saw her reading me and reading me from the end of the world where i saw her standing and the way the sacred light played across her face all i can tell you is i had to be a diamond of ice to manage right down the middle from beginning to end my life pours into one ocean into this prison with its empty ballfield and its empty preparations for never happen if she ever comes to visit me to hell with her i won ’ t talk to her and my son can entertain himself god kill them both i ’ m sorry for nothing i ’ m just an alien from another planet i am not happy disappointment lights its stupid fire in my heart but two days a week i staff the max security laundry above the world on the seventh level looking at two long roads out there that go to a couple of towns young girls accelerating through the intersection make me want to live forever they make me think of the grand things of wars and extremely white quiet light that never dies sometimes i stand against the window for hours tuned to every station at once so loaded on crystal meth i believe i ’ ll drift out of my body jesus christ your doors close and open you touch the maniac drifters the fireaters i could say a million things about you and never get that silence out of time that happens when the blank muscle hangs between its beats—that is what i mean by darkness the place where i kiss your mouth where nothing bad has happened i ’ m not anyone but i wish i could be told when you will come to save us i have written several poems and several hymns and one has been performed on the religious ultrahigh frequency station and it goes like this
i am a slave to the nudity of women i do not know with what resolve i could stand against it a naked woman asking of me anything an unclothed woman is sometimes other things i see her in a dish of green pears anselmo do you know what i mean if i say without clothes her breasts are the two lions in front of the new york public library do you know that postcard of mine in those lions there is something for which i have in exchange only sounds only my fingers i see her everywhere she is the lions and the pears those letters of the alphabet as children we called dirty the w the y the small o. she is absolutely the wet clothing on the line or you know to be more intimate may i the nub the nose of the pear do you know what i mean those parts of the woman i will call two spanish dancer hats or rounder sometimes doughboy helmets from the war sometimes they are flat in the late afternoon asleep like drawings like a single rock thrown into the lake these parts of a woman an imperfect circling gyre of lines moving out beyond the water they reach me at the shore anselmo without fail they are stronger and they have always been faster than i am it ’ s like watching the lassoing man the man with the perfectly circling rope pedro armendariz in the mexican movies or will rogers wherever one is from whoever this man is and he is always there everybody knows one he always makes his big lasso twirling his rope around himself and a woman from the audience only i am the woman do you understand anselmo caught in the circling rope i am the woman and me thinking of a woman without clothes is that man and that rope and we are riding on separate horses
they thought the trouble was over they thought they had talked it all out it was a mistake she ’ d said this infatuation for someone else which had turned suddenly too serious she could see that now but they thought there was nothing left of it their nerves had been rubbed so raw through bouts of anger shame even love so many words had come and gone between them that they couldn ’ t easily remember what they ’ d said what they ’ d imagined but it didn ’ t matter now they thought they had gotten over something difficult something which had felt immovable the long unbearable ache which had become too much a habit and they were celebrating in their way having dinner at a new expensive place where they had no history of being together where they expected nothing they were sipping wine a deep rich red the waiter was hovering over them like a generous uncle and they were selecting everything he had suggested— how good to be in his hands for awhile soon it was happening the old ardor was coming back they were beginning to flirt with one another the way she said baby the way his shoulder was brushing hers the way they were allowing themselves to think for the first time in a long time of the good sex they might later have the after-talk which would be easy and low and maybe he hadn ’ t meant what he was about to say maybe when she remarked how she loved the leek soup it was the wine in him his jauntiness that made him ask what else she loved jokingly at first whether she loved the stuffed mushrooms on his plate the braised beef or maybe she loved what others were having this one in the dark suit or that one with the coyly unbuttoned collar or maybe she loved the whole damn menu in fact he couldn ’ t help himself the words came pouring forth spilling all over the table and it was not until late at night when she ’ d finally gone to her room and closed herself off from him in sleep that he stopped talking and remembered only half of what he ’ d said because he ’ d said too much created too much damage crossed some boundary he had avoided most of his life maybe it was desert maybe tundra or the white insinuating madness of the polar ice cap but wherever he was was strange and dangerous and somehow dazzling for all that and only in the morning would he know for better or worse in which direction each of them would be walking it though never had he felt as he had tonight so permissive with himself so luxuriously tactless having said again and again the words he thought he could never bear to use so suddenly commonplace so readily available to him now
to him who in the love of nature holds communion with her visible forms she speaks a various language for his gayer hours she has a voice of gladness and a smile and eloquence of beauty and she glides into his darker musings with a mild and healing sympathy that steals away their sharpness ere he is aware when thoughts of the last bitter hour come like a blight over thy spirit and sad images of the stern agony and shroud and pall and breathless darkness and the narrow house make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart — go forth under the open sky and list to nature ’ s teachings while from all around— earth and her waters and the depths of air— comes a still voice— yet a few days and thee the all-beholding sun shall see no more in all his course nor yet in the cold ground where thy pale form was laid with many tears nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist thy image earth that nourished thee shall claim thy growth to be resolved to earth again and lost each human trace surrendering up thine individual being shalt thou go to mix for ever with the elements to be a brother to the insensible rock and to the sluggish clod which the rude swain turns with his share and treads upon the oak shall send his roots abroad and pierce thy mould yet not to thine eternal resting-place shalt thou retire alone nor couldst thou wish couch more magnificent thou shalt lie down with patriarchs of the infant world—with kings the powerful of the earth—the wise the good fair forms and hoary seers of ages past all in one mighty sepulchre the hills rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun —the vales stretching in pensive quietness between the venerable woods—rivers that move in majesty and the complaining brooks that make the meadows green and poured round all old ocean ’ s gray and melancholy waste — are but the solemn decorations all of the great tomb of man the golden sun the planets all the infinite host of heaven are shining on the sad abodes of death through the still lapse of ages all that tread the globe are but a handful to the tribes that slumber in its bosom.—take the wings of morning pierce the barcan wilderness or lose thyself in the continuous woods where rolls the oregon and hears no sound save his own dashings—yet the dead are there and millions in those solitudes since first the flight of years began have laid them down in their last sleep—the dead reign there alone so shalt thou rest and what if thou withdraw in silence from the living and no friend take note of thy departure all that breathe will share thy destiny the gay will laugh when thou art gone the solemn brood of care plod on and each one as before will chase his favorite phantom yet all these shall leave their mirth and their employments and shall come and make their bed with thee as the long train of ages glide away the sons of men the youth in life ’ s green spring and he who goes in the full strength of years matron and maid the speechless babe and the gray-headed man— shall one by one be gathered to thy side by those who in their turn shall follow them so live that when thy summons comes to join the innumerable caravan which moves to that mysterious realm where each shall take his chamber in the silent halls of death thou go not like the quarry-slave at night scourged to his dungeon but sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust approach thy grave like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams
for the first time i listen to a lost and secret recording of us making love near-on ten years ago i recognize your voice your sounds though if i knew no better i could be any man in any room after the rising sounds of rising and of dressing and once as you step up close to the deck perhaps to pick up shoes you sing the chorus of sunday morning i call on you to hurry and we leave it does not end then the tape rolls on a few late cars which sigh by might have passed us walking away triumphant unaware we ’ ve left behind this mop and mow mechanism of silence to which we may never return
these poems these poems these poems she said are poems with no love in them these are the poems of a man who would leave his wife and child because they made noise in his study these are the poems of a man who would murder his mother to claim the inheritance these are the poems of a man like plato she said meaning something i did not comprehend but which nevertheless offended me these are the poems of a man who would rather sleep with himself than with women she said these are the poems of a man with eyes like a drawknife with hands like a pickpocket ’ s hands woven of water and logic and hunger with no strand of love in them these poems are as heartless as birdsong as unmeant as elm leaves which if they love love only the wide blue sky and the air and the idea of elm leaves self-love is an ending she said and not a beginning love means love of the thing sung not of the song or the singing these poems she said ... you are he said beautiful that is not love she said rightly
this living hand now warm and capable of earnest grasping would if it were cold and in the icy silence of the tomb so haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights that thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood so in my veins red life might stream again and thou be conscience-calm ’ d–see here it is– i hold it towards you
though i am young and can not tell either what death or love is well yet i have heard they both bear darts and both do aim at human hearts and then again i have been told love wounds with heat as death with cold so that i fear they do but bring extremes to touch and mean one thing as in a ruin we it call one thing to be blown up or fall or to our end like way may have by a flash of lightning or a wave so love ’ s inflamèd shaft or brand may kill as soon as death ’ s cold hand except love ’ s fires the virtue have to fright the frost out of the grave
though that men do call it dotage who loveth not wanteth courage and whosoever may love get from venus sure he must it fet or else from her which is her heir and she to him must seem most fair with eye and mind doth both agree there is no boot there must it be the eye doth look and represent but mind afformeth with full consent thus am i fixed without grudge mine eye with heart doth me so judge love maintaineth all noble courage who love disdaineth is all of the village such lovers—though they take pain— it were pity they should obtain for often times where they do sue they hinder lovers that would be true for whoso loveth should love but once change whoso will i will be none
a thousand martyrs i have made all sacrificed to my desire a thousand beauties have betrayed that languish in resistless fire the untamed heart to hand i brought and fixed the wild and wandering thought i never vowed nor sighed in vain but both though false were well received the fair are pleased to give us pain and what they wish is soon believed and though i talked of wounds and smart love ’ s pleasures only touched my heart alone the glory and the spoil i always laughing bore away the triumphs without pain or toil without the hell the heav ’ n of joy and while i thus at random rove despise the fools that whine for love
mamua when our laughter ends and hearts and bodies brown as white are dust about the doors of friends or scent ablowing down the night then oh then the wise agree comes our immortality mamua there waits a land hard for us to understand out of time beyond the sun all are one in paradise you and pupure are one and taü and the ungainly wise there the eternals are and there the good the lovely and the true and types whose earthly copies were the foolish broken things we knew there is the face whose ghosts we are the real the never-setting star and the flower of which we love faint and fading shadows here never a tear but only grief dance but not the limbs that move songs in song shall disappear instead of lovers love shall be for hearts immutability and there on the ideal reef thunders the everlasting sea and my laughter and my pain shall home to the eternal brain and all lovely things they say meet in loveliness again miri ’ s laugh teïpo ’ s feet and the hands of matua stars and sunlight there shall meet coral ’ s hues and rainbows there and teüra ’ s braided hair and with the starred tiare ’ s white and white birds in the dark ravine and flamboyants ablaze at night and jewels and evening ’ s after-green and dawns of pearl and gold and red mamua your lovelier head and there ’ ll no more be one who dreams under the ferns of crumbling stuff eyes of illusion mouth that seems all time-entangled human love and you ’ ll no longer swing and sway divinely down the scented shade where feet to ambulation fade and moons are lost in endless day how shall we wind these wreaths of ours where there are neither heads nor flowers oh heaven ’ s heaven —but we ’ ll be missing the palms and sunlight and the south and there ’ s an end i think of kissing when our mouths are one with mouth ... taü here mamua crown the hair and come away hear the calling of the moon and the whispering scents that stray about the idle warm lagoon hasten hand in human hand down the dark the flowered way along the whiteness of the sand and in the water ’ s soft caress wash the mind of foolishness mamua until the day spend the glittering moonlight there pursuing down the soundless deep limbs that gleam and shadowy hair or floating lazy half-asleep dive and double and follow after snare in flowers and kiss and call with lips that fade and human laughter and faces individual well this side of paradise ... there ’ s little comfort in the wise
o patient shore that canst not go to meet thy love the restless sea how comfortest thou all thy loneliness art thou at rest when loosing his strong arms from round thy feet he turns away know ’ st thou however sweet that other shore may be that to thy breast he must return and when in sterner test he folds thee to a heart which does not beat wraps thee in ice and gives no smile no kiss to break long wintry days still dost thou miss naught from thy trust still wait unfaltering the higher warmer waves which leap in spring o sweet wise shore to be so satisfied o heart learn from the shore love has a tide
time does not bring relief you all have lied who told me time would ease me of my pain i miss him in the weeping of the rain i want him at the shrinking of the tide the old snows melt from every mountain-side and last year ’ s leaves are smoke in every lane but last year ’ s bitter loving must remain heaped on my heart and my old thoughts abide there are a hundred places where i fear to go —so with his memory they brim and entering with relief some quiet place where never fell his foot or shone his face i say “ there is no memory of him here ” and so stand stricken so remembering him
the time i ’ ve lost in wooing in watching and pursuing the light that lies in woman ’ s eyes has been my heart ’ s undoing though wisdom oft has sought me i scorn ’ d the lore she brought me my only books were woman ’ s looks and folly ’ s all they ’ ve taught me her smile when beauty granted i hung with gaze enchanted like him the sprite whom maids by night oft meet in glen that ’ s haunted like him too beauty won me but while her eyes were on me if once their ray was turn ’ d away oh winds could not outrun me and are those follies going and is my proud heart growing too cold or wise for brilliant eyes again to set it glowing no vain alas th ’ endeavour from bonds so sweet to sever poor wisdom ’ s chance against a glance is now as weak as ever
vainly my heart had with thy sorceries striven it had no refuge from thy love —no heaven but in thy fatal presence —from afar it owned thy power and trembled like a star o ’ erfraught with light and splendor could i deem how dark a shadow should obscure its beam — could i believe that pain could ever dwell where thy bright presence cast its blissful spell thou wert my proud palladium —could i fear the avenging destinies when thou wert near — thou wert my destiny —thy song thy fame the wild enchantments clustering round thy name were my soul ’ s heritage its royal dower its glory and its kingdom and its power
had i a man ’ s fair form then might my sighs be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell thine ear and find thy gentle heart so well would passion arm me for the enterprise but ah i am no knight whose foeman dies no cuirass glistens on my bosom ’ s swell i am no happy shepherd of the dell whose lips have trembled with a maiden ’ s eyes yet must i dote upon thee—call thee sweet sweeter by far than hybla ’ s honied roses when steep ’ d in dew rich to intoxication ah i will taste that dew for me ‘ tis meet and when the moon her pallid face discloses i ’ ll gather some by spells and incantation
the dark is thrown back from the brightness like hair cast over a shoulder i am alone four years older like the chairs and the walls which i once watched brighten with you beside me i was to waken never like this whatever came or was taken the stalk grows the year beats on the wind apples come and the month for their fall the bark spreads the roots tighten though today be the last or tomorrow all you will not mind that i may not remember does not matter i shall not be with you again what we knew even now must scatter and be ruined and blow like dust in the rain you have been dead a long season and have less than desire who were lover with lover and i have life—that old reason to wait for what comes to leave what is over
brighter than fireflies upon the uji river are your words in the dark beloved
now you have freely given me leave to love what will you do shall i your mirth or passion move when i begin to woo will you torment or scorn or love me too each petty beauty can disdain and i spite of your hate without your leave can see and die dispense a nobler fate ’ tis easy to destroy you may create then give me leave to love and love me too not with design to raise as love ’ s cursed rebels do when puling poets whine fame to their beauty from their blubbered eyne grief is a puddle and reflects not clear your beauty ’ s rays joys are pure streams your eyes appear sullen in sadder lays in cheerful numbers they shine bright with praise which shall not mention to express you fair wounds flames and darts storms in your brow nets in your hair suborning all your parts or to betray or torture captive hearts i ’ ll make your eyes like morning suns appear as mild and fair your brow as crystal smooth and clear and your disheveled hair shall flow like a calm region of the air

when love with unconfinèd wings hovers within my gates and my divine althea brings to whisper at the grates when i lie tangled in her hair and fettered to her eye the gods that wanton in the air know no such liberty when flowing cups run swiftly round with no allaying thames our careless heads with roses bound our hearts with loyal flames when thirsty grief in wine we steep when healths and draughts go free fishes that tipple in the deep know no such liberty when like committed linnets i with shriller throat shall sing the sweetness mercy majesty and glories of my king when i shall voice aloud how good he is how great should be enlargèd winds that curl the flood know no such liberty stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage minds innocent and quiet take that for an hermitage if i have freedom in my love and in my soul am free angels alone that soar above enjoy such liberty

are there two things of all which men possess that are so like each other and so near as mutual love seems like to happiness dear asra woman beyond utterance dear this love which ever welling at my heart now in its living fount doth heave and fall now overflowing pours thro ’ every part of all my frame and fills and changes all like vernal waters springing up through snow this love that seeming great beyond the power of growth yet seemeth ever more to grow could i transmute the whole to one rich dower of happy life and give it all to thee thy lot methinks were heaven thy age eternity

best and brightest come away fairer far than this fair day which like thee to those in sorrow comes to bid a sweet good-morrow to the rough year just awake in its cradle on the brake the brightest hour of unborn spring through the winter wandering found it seems the halcyon morn to hoar february born bending from heaven in azure mirth it kissed the forehead of the earth and smiled upon the silent sea and bade the frozen streams be free and waked to music all their fountains and breathed upon the frozen mountains and like a prophetess of may strewed flowers upon the barren way making the wintry world appear like one on whom thou smilest dear away away from men and towns to the wild wood and the downs— to the silent wilderness where the soul need not repress its music lest it should not find an echo in another ’ s mind while the touch of nature ’ s art harmonizes heart to heart i leave this notice on my door for each accustomed visitor — “ i am gone into the fields to take what this sweet hour yields — reflection you may come tomorrow sit by the fireside with sorrow.— you with the unpaid bill despair — you tiresome verse-reciter care — i will pay you in the grave — death will listen to your stave expectation too be off today is for itself enough hope in pity mock not woe with smiles nor follow where i go long having lived on thy sweet food at length i find one moment ’ s good after long pain—with all your love this you never told me of. ” radiant sister of the day awake arise and come away to the wild woods and the plains and the pools where winter rains image all their roof of leaves where the pine its garland weaves of sapless green and ivy dun round stems that never kiss the sun where the lawns and pastures be and the sandhills of the sea — where the melting hoar-frost wets the daisy-star that never sets and wind-flowers and violets which yet join not scent to hue crown the pale year weak and new when the night is left behind in the deep east dun and blind and the blue noon is over us and the multitudinous billows murmur at our feet where the earth and ocean meet and all things seem only one in the universal sun

vandergast to his neighbors— the grinding of a garage door and hiss of gravel in the driveway he worked for the insurance company whose talisman is a phoenix rising in flames ... non omnis moriar from his desk he had a view of the street— translucent raincoats and umbrellas fluorescent plate-glass windows a girl knelt down arranging underwear on a female dummy— sea waves and on the gale venus these busy days poised in her garter belt and stockings the next day he saw her eating in the restaurant where he usually ate soon they were having lunch together elsewhere she came from dallas this was only a start she was ambitious twenty-five and still unmarried green eyes with silver spiricles ... red hair ... when he held the car door open her legs were smooth and slender “ i was wondering ” she said “ when you 'd get round to it ” and laughed vandergast says he never intended having an affair and was that what this was the names that people give to things ... what do definitions and divorce-court proceedings have to do with the breathless reality o little lamp at the bedside with views of venice and the bay of naples you understood lactona toothbrush and suitcase bought in a hurry you were the witnesses of the love we made in bed together schrafft 's chocolate cherries surely you remember when she said she 'd be true forever and watching “ dark storm ” we decided there is something to be said after all for soap opera “ if it makes people happy. ” the vandergasts are having some trouble finding a buyer for their house when i go for a walk with tippy i pass the unweeded tennis court the empty garage windows heavily shuttered mrs. vandergast took the children and went back to her family and vandergast moved to new jersey where he works for an insurance company whose emblem is the rock of gibraltar— the rest of his life laid out with the child-support and alimony payments as for the girl she vanished was it worth it ask vandergast you 'd have to be vandergast looking through his eyes at the house across the street in orange new jersey maybe on wet days umbrellas and raincoats set his heart thudding maybe he talks to his pillow and it whispers moving red hair in any case he will soon be forty
waking on the train i thought we were attacked by light chrome-winged birds hatching from the lagoon that first day the buoys were all that made the harbor bearable pennies sewn into a hemline later i learned to live in it to walk through the alien city— a beekeeper ’ s habit— with fierce light clinging to my head and hands treated as gently as every other guest— each house ’ s barbed antennae trawling for any kind of weather— still i sobbed in a glass box on an unswept street with the last few lire ticking like fleas off my phonecard i ’ m sorry i can ’ t stand this which one of us do you love

i dreamed this mortal part of mine was metamorphosed to a vine which crawling one and every way enthralled my dainty lucia methought her long small legs and thighs i with my tendrils did surprise her belly buttocks and her waist by my soft nervelets were embraced about her head i writhing hung and with rich clusters hid among the leaves her temples i behung so that my lucia seemed to me young bacchus ravished by his tree my curls about her neck did crawl and arms and hands they did enthrall so that she could not freely stir all parts there made one prisoner but when i crept with leaves to hide those parts which maids keep unespied such fleeting pleasures there i took that with the fancy i awoke and found ah me this flesh of mine more like a stock than like a vine

methought i saw the grave where laura lay within that temple where the vestal flame was wont to burn and passing by that way to see that buried dust of living fame whose tomb fair love and fairer virtue kept all suddenly i saw the fairy queen at whose approach the soul of petrarch wept and from thenceforth those graces were not seen for they this queen attended in whose stead oblivion laid him down on laura ’ s hearse hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed and groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce where homer ’ s spright did tremble all for grief and cursed the access of that celestial thief
you saved me you should remember me the spring of the year young men buying tickets for the ferryboats laughter because the air is full of apple blossoms when i woke up i realized i was capable of the same feeling i remember sounds like that from my childhood laughter for no cause simply because the world is beautiful something like that lugano tables under the apple trees deckhands raising and lowering the colored flags and by the lake ’ s edge a young man throws his hat into the water perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him crucial sounds or gestures like a track laid down before the larger themes and then unused buried islands in the distance my mother holding out a plate of little cakes— as far as i remember changed in no detail the moment vivid intact having never been exposed to light so that i woke elated at my age hungry for life utterly confident— by the tables patches of new grass the pale green pieced into the dark existing ground surely spring has been returned to me this time not as a lover but a messenger of death yet it is still spring it is still meant tenderly
when thou must home to shades of underground and there arrived a new admirèd guest the beauteous spirits do engirt thee round white iope blithe helen and the rest to hear the stories of thy finished love from that smooth tongue whose music hell can move then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights of masques and revels which sweet youth did make of tourneys and great challenges of knights and all these triumphs for thy beauty ’ s sake when thou hast told these honours done to thee then tell o tell how thou didst murder me
as you came from the holy land of walsinghame met you not with my true love by the way as you came how shall i know your true love that have met many one as i went to the holy land that have come that have gone she is neither white nor brown but as the heavens fair there is none hath a form so divine in the earth or the air such an one did i meet good sir such an angelic face who like a queen like a nymph did appear by her gait by her grace she hath left me here all alone all alone as unknown who sometimes did me lead with her self and me loved as her own what ’ s the cause that she leaves you alone and a new way doth take who loved you once as her own and her joy did you make i have loved her all my youth but now old as you see love likes not the falling fruit from the withered tree know that love is a careless child and forgets promise past he is blind he is deaf when he list and in faith never fast his desire is a dureless content and a trustless joy he is won with a world of despair and is lost with a toy of womenkind such indeed is the love or the word love abused under which many childish desires and conceits are excused but true love is a durable fire in the mind ever burning never sick never old never dead from itself never turning
two musics washing over me and morning asks which loneliness comes closest to the inky chromatics inside you how can i answer the cricket in the tarantula ’ s cage chirrs the next world meanwhile scraps of chopin float up the stairs on my wife ’ s trilling fingers which played me whole worlds ago last night when i was buried in we
it has never been so easy to cry openly or to acknowledge children never before could i walk directly to the center of an island city feeling the automatism of millions drawing one pious breath shouldering the sunset holding it up in the oily tree-line a while longer years ago i was never sad enough and nothing but a hotel that i could tear to pieces and reconstruct inside a shoebox felt like home my parents died their miserable possessions washed up in other hotels dioramas of the febrile romantic i take my first lover already gray at her temples and more reticent than shy more tacit than admiring to the bus stop by the jewish museum we wait in the dark a long time she does not kiss me she hurries up out of the oily street onto the humming fluorescent podium of the last bus where i see her a last time not waving to me not lovable erect in the freedom we traduced years ago in our first kiss never deny the power of withdrawal never doubt that thought and time make things small never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed uncomprehending gesture at childhood ’ s end none can tell happiness from buoyancy none of it made any difference— the patricides the hotels ill-constructed the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion we are no more complicated than our great-grandparents who dreaded the hotel life like them we seek the refuge of warm days in january a piety whose compulsion is to survive according to explicit laws no young woman adores or young man follows with darling hunger
for love—i would split open your head and put a candle in behind the eyes love is dead in us if we forget the virtues of an amulet and quick surprise
to men you put on an ornate ballgown you say “ someone has to do it ” you take me to where you work the inside of a pyramid with chasms watching the complex train-track changes products and objects make love to my father two babies are born—bruno and daisy you take your shirt off looking boylike lovely you get on the plane both clown wizard and then get off in a comedy of manners our dates become a comedy of dinners your name rhymes with clothes your plane folds flies away without us i ’ ll make the next one we are enclosed in spaceless epics by breathless bricks still we ’ ll meet like runes or the leashes for hawks let ’ s go can we stay go to sleep a tree wouldn ’ t talk or weep if i-forget-what and you in the train ’ s opulent rooms switch your cock to a baby and then say “ must there not be a law against this ” you add “ i have been thinking of you in my head ” you wear green glitter on your shirt instead of a tie that ’ s how i recognize you as you you are the prep cook the sous-chef you make duplicating potato salad like the loaves fishes you create gorgeous paper-like sculptures of foods we go down in the car through threatening snows to arrive in a second to eat in a renovated place you and i tell “ what ” we are at the end of a movie our podium of soft loud feet flies by accident i take the train to your house to hear shakespeare verdi everyone applauds when you walk in the director holds up each actor describes his physical being i talk to your father but only by telephone you have the royal blue 8 � x 11 notebook with the lock on it i want one but you say you cant get them anymore i walk twice through that city i ’ ve been in before all through its rooms its streets and its commons
they were sitting on the thin mattress he ’ d once rolled carried up the four floors to his room only to find it covered nearly all of the bare wood leaving just a small path alongside the wall between them was the sack of oranges pears she ’ d brought its neck turned back to expose the colors of the fruit as she opened a bottle of wine he reached over to a tall stack of books pulled out the tao with a silly flourish handed it across the bed to her she looked up simply poured the two squat water glasses half-full with wine then she took the book reading silently not aloud as he ’ d assumed suddenly he felt clearly she knew the way two people must come upon such an understanding together of course but separately as the moon the wave remain individually one
my heart is a fancy place where giant reddish-purple cauliflowers white ones in french english are outside waiting to welcome you to a boat over the low black river for a big dinner there 's alot of choice among the foods even a tortured lamb served in pieces en croute on a plate so hot as a rack of clouds blown over the cold filthy river we are entitled to see anytime while we use the tablecovers to love each other publicly dishing out imitative luxuries to show off poetry 's extreme generosity then home in the heart of a big limousine
that halloween i wore your wedding dress our children spooked wouldn ’ t speak for days i ’ d razored taut calves smooth teased each blown tress then—lipsticked mascaraed self-amazed— shimmied like a starlet on the dance floor i ’ d never felt so sensual before— catholic schoolgirl neighborhood whore in bed dolled up undone we fantasized we clutched fused torn twins who ’ d been denied you were my shy groom love i was your bride
thou god whose high eternal love is the only blue sky of our life clear all the heaven that bends above the life-road of this man and wife may these two lives be but one note in the world ’ s strange-sounding harmony whose sacred music e ’ er shall float through every discord up to thee as when from separate stars two beams unite to form one tender ray as when two sweet but shadowy dreams explain each other in the day so may these two dear hearts one light emit and each interpret each let an angel come and dwell tonight in this dear double-heart and teach
weep you no more sad fountains what need you flow so fast look how the snowy mountains heaven ’ s sun doth gently waste but my sun ’ s heavenly eyes view not your weeping that now lie sleeping softly now softly lies sleeping sleep is a reconciling a rest that peace begets doth not the sun rise smiling when fair at even he sets rest you then rest sad eyes melt not in weeping while she lies sleeping softly now softly lies sleeping
often the slightest gesture is most telling as when he reaches tenderly in passing to pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall of her hair or even the absence of all gesture the way she doesn ’ t need to turn to know who in this gathering of friends has touched her it was as if he dreamed some private garden perhaps he woke from it mid-reach to find his hand too near her hair in this crowded yard and maybe even now she ’ s shuttering in she ’ s even better than you or i at that a storm of worry and recrimination— did anyone notice how could he do that here — by seamlessly continuing to tell you about her trip to see her favorite vermeer this morning in the delft show at the met “ so now they say she isn ’ t weighing pearls or gold or anything—it ’ s just the light gleaming off empty scales. ” so much is hard to know for sure if i confronted her she ’ d say it was just a leaf—who could afford to disagree could we now she ’ s explaining how the girl faces a mirror we can ’ t see into and how behind her hangs a gloomy painting of the last judgment “ over her head god floats in a cloud ” she says “ like a thought balloon. ” but you don ’ t hear you ’ re watching me i nod

1 in prologue let me plainly say i shall not ever come to that discretion where i do not rage to think i grow decrepit bursten-bellied bald and toothless thick of hearing tremulous of leg dry and rough-barked as a hemlock slab the soft rot setting in and all my wheezy dreams the tunnelling of beetles in a raspy bark for now i am fleshed at smaller sports and grow in time into the mineral thick fell of earth vermont hairy with violets roses lilies and like minions and darlings of the spring meantime working wonders rousing astonishments and being a humble man i at the same time acknowledge my miscreate the nightshades cabbages and fleaworts of my plot though always i try to turn my back and scorn upon the inkhorn term and speak as is most commonly received with smile and wink and approbative nod not overfine nor at the same time reckless of the phrase nor ever ugly turdy tut-mouthed but always joyous at the goosey brain the woolpack of the solid cloud a crowd a heap a troop a plume of trees grass gulls and rabbits in the end no doubt a vulgar prattle but the planet swells and bulges and protrudes beyond my eyes ’ aversions and tottery fuddled always i give up i am not understood or wrongly out of some general assumption of my innocence 2 this much i wish to say my nonesuch nosegay native sweet in someway plainer this is my letter to you and out of most severe purpose the bee the honey stalk the whole keep of the house endanger me the perspectives of the clapboard the steep falls of the lawn the razory apices of ridges and the abdominous curves of the meadow into the far trees there are ponds below the house and water runs the road crosses the water and the road diminishes to the reach of the next farm and the farm beyond that and two miles bearing right or left somewhere runs highway 25. i have found my way with difficulty i am confused halfway i have suffered a failure of vital powers a swoon have been smirked at by the natives and misdirected fitting for i always dream of the painless redemption the return from fiasco and tumultuous journey to the transcendentally serene lawns of a transcendentally white house with columns of oak trees and iron deer and the affectionate greeting of one who has these many years waited in full patience without complaint for me to come in bleeding dusty and deliquescent from the fields the blade in my thigh or blinded the victim of fire or ravenous birds the lovely blood on my cheek like tears one-limbed a bullet in my heart my hands my head cut off and the dark pulses of my blood diminishing yet never a reproach for my criminal self-negligence my careless japeries and clumsy flounderings instead my brow is wiped my wounds attended to blood let leeches applied i heal i grow strong i can set forth again renewed valiant sturdy full of high spirits lively gay spruce in looks a reveler a merry prankster dimpled in the cheek from smiling perfect pilgrim fit for the chemistry of the resurrection yet i am of wild and changeful moods i am perhaps worthy of being stoned sometimes i lie hid and lurk in wait for the giggling girleries and leap out and shout and scatter them like chickens from the boot to the safe and flying four winds i am easy and fluent in the telling of lies and let it be said that i roar and sing scurrilous songs in base places and shall no doubt for this little vain merriment find a sorrowful reckoning in the end still my noises please me and what this wretched poet overmuch desires he easily believes it is his conventional cowardice it makes him immortally glad but then he always grows morose that is in his favor he repents lances his soul thinks of the willows and the columned porch and the wind melliloquent about the chimneys and you from where he sits now at the far end of this small porch of a federal farmhouse in this very and summery vermont 3 i look down the pitches of the lawn fireflies make small explosions among the grass stems and i think that to walk down that slant of lawn to the black waters of the brook at the dark join of the cleft would be like dying and that if i die i will never pardon time i think my words will echo only in my own mind forever to what purpose i do not know i see a firefly trapped inside the screen i have no name for any of this i know it clearly in the same way i know the dead cry of the starlings in the eaves the smell of after rain the warm air holding in the hollows of the roads for this there is no name the holding mind is likewise without name that is the final thought it is the disorder the reason for all this the clouds begin to reach up blood mountain and i am sitting on a farmhouse porch and there are trees and it is late and i am dreaming that i dream i stare down into a fouled well and see the white legbones of a deer and the water ’ s surface matte with loose hair the green stink welling and bellying from the fertile sump up and flowing outwards in a fountaining current of vines and melons and leaves and the knotgrass lawns blossoming with gilliflowers shoulder-high cloud-high the sun finally smothering in grass and then in the entire silence of this growth the grasses thickening darkening becoming clouds reaching up from the ridges and all night there is rain i dream that when i awaken it is a shining milky day four roosters are crowing in the yard and geese dabble in the green soft muds of the ditches this is the literal surface and for all the extravagance of what has gone before i now repent and make an image all of vermont each night blazes with fireflies the comet is a faint green phosphorescence to the north the catalpas blossom and each noon the sunlight hardens and the sky is a clear ground and i can look from my open doorway into dry and fiery yards you see i draw back always i can not be understood o i wud slepe all the swete darkemans nor ever speke it was as if i had forgotten to see the steep lawns suddenly erupt in tiny lights it was as if my fingers burned green and blazed with crushed fireflies and as usual no deer appeared the strict edges of the meadow held nothing when i drive home my carlights sweep the road before me i override the long shadows of the pebbles and grasses and the sky grows long clouds i drive into the soft explosions of lightning far to the west at the end of the confusing road where i will sleep and awaken and sleep again my hands in the dashboard lights are glowing softly green this whole journey is before me i know i am touched with the phosphors of self-love the light knows it is light a great red moon rides wedged in a crevice of clouds and i come up the widening road as if it is the driveway to your house
what length of verse can serve brave mopsa ’ s good to show whose virtues strange and beauties such as no man them may know thus shrewdly burden then how can my muse escape the gods must help and precious things must serve to show her shape like great god saturn fair and like fair venus chaste as smooth as pan as juno mild like goddess iris fast with cupid she foresees and goes god vulcan ’ s pace and for a taste of all these gifts she borrows momus ’ grace her forehead jacinth-like her cheeks of opal hue her twinkling eyes bedecked with pearl her lips of sapphire blue her hair pure crapall stone her mouth o heavenly wide her skin like burnished gold her hands like silver ore untried as for those parts unknown which hidden sure are best happy be they which believe and never seek the rest
what lips my lips have kissed and where and why i have forgotten and what arms have lain under my head till morning but the rain is full of ghosts tonight that tap and sigh upon the glass and listen for reply and in my heart there stirs a quiet pain for unremembered lads that not again will turn to me at midnight with a cry thus in the winter stands the lonely tree nor knows what birds have vanished one by one yet knows its boughs more silent than before i can not say what loves have come and gone i only know that summer sang in me a little while that in me sings no more
“ the orgasm has replaced the cross as the focus of longing and the image of fulfillment. ” —malcolm muggeridge 1966 i. hubbie 1 used to get wholly pissed when i made myself come i ’ m right here he ’ d sputter blood popping to the surface of his fuzzed cheeks goddamn it i ’ m right here by that time i was in no mood to discuss the myriad merits of my pointer or to jam the brakes on the express train slicing through my blood it was easier to suffer the practiced professorial huff the hissed invectives and the cold old shoulder liver-dotted quaking with rage shall we pause to bless professors and codgers and their bellowed unquestioned ownership of things i was sneaking time with my own body i know i signed something over but it wasn ’ t that ii no matter how i angle this history it ’ s weird so let ’ s just say bringing up baby was on the telly and suddenly my lips pressing against the couch cushions felt spectacular and i thought wow this is strange what the hell i ’ m 30 years old am i dying down there is this the feel does the cunt go to heaven first ooh snapped river ooh shimmy i had never had it never knew oh i clamored and lurched beneath my little succession of boys i cried writhed hissed ooh wee suffered their flat lapping and machine-gun diddling their insistent c ’ mon girl c ’ mon until i memorized the blueprint for drawing blood from their shoulders until there was nothing left but the self-satisfied liquidy snore of he who has rocked she he who has made she weep with script but this oh cary gee katherine hallelujah baby the fur do fly all gush and kaboom on the wind iii don ’ t hate me because i am multiple hurtling as long as there is still skin on the pad of my finger as long as i ’ m awake as long as my new husband ’ s mouth holds out i am the spinner the unbridled the bellowing freak when i have emptied him he leans back coos edges me along keeps wondering count he falls to his knees in front of it marvels at my yelps and carousing spine stares unflinching as i bleed spittle unto the pillows he has married a witness my body bucks slave to its selfish engine and love is the dim miracle of these little deaths fracturing speeding for the surface iv we know the record as it taunts us we have giggled considered stopwatches little laboratories somewhere beneath the suffering clean swathed in eyes and silver she came 134 times in one hour i imagine wires holding her tight her throat a rattling window searching scrubbed places for her name i find only reams of numbers i ask the quietest of them v. are we god
when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv ’ d with plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for me that follow ’ d and else when i carous ’ d or when my plans were accomplish ’ d still i was not happy but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health refresh ’ d singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light when i wander ’ d alone over the beach and undressing bathed laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming o then i was happy o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food nourish ’ d me more and the beautiful day pass ’ d well and the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came my friend and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night in the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me and his arm lay lightly around my breast – and that night i was happy
when i was fair and young then favor graced me of many was i sought their mistress for to be but i did scorn them all and answered them therefore go go go seek some other where importune me no more how many weeping eyes i made to pine in woe how many sighing hearts i have not skill to show but i the prouder grew and still this spake therefore go go go seek some other where importune me no more then spake fair venus ’ son that proud victorious boy saying you dainty dame for that you be so coy i will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more go go go seek some other where importune me no more as soon as he had said such change grew in my breast that neither night nor day i could take any rest wherefore i did repent that i had said before go go go seek some other where importune me no more
when last we parted thou wert young and fair how beautiful let fond remembrance say alas since then old time has stolen away full thirty years leaving my temples bare.— so has it perished like a thing of air the dream of love and youth — now both are grey yet still remembering that delightful day though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair though i have suffered many years of pain since then though i did never think to live to hear that voice or see those eyes again i can a sad but cordial greeting give and for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer— as when i loved thee young and fair
when ’ midst the gay i meet that gentle smile of thine though still on me it turns most sweet i scarce can call it mine but when to me alone your secret tears you show oh then i feel those tears my own and claim them while they flow then still with bright looks bless the gay the cold the free give smiles to those who love you less but keep your tears for me the snow on jura ’ s steep can smile in many a beam yet still in chains of coldness sleep how bright soe ’ er it seem but when some deep-felt ray whose touch is fire appears oh then the smile is warm ’ d away and melting turns to tears then still with bright looks bless the gay the cold the free give smiles to those who love you less but keep your tears for me
it ’ s all the rage to sport waxed moustaches and cure your own sausages in some mildewy basement that formerly would have hosted convulsively awkward parties with spin the bottle and seven minutes in the dark and terrifying closet aka heaven but now boasts soppressata strung on repurposed vintage drying racks and fat clay pots of kombucha and curdling hops personally i 've never recovered from the sex-shaped void left in those closets by all the groping that should have occurred to me but did n't right under my nose kids my age were creeping into adulthood one clammy trembling palm on one breast at a time there was also the horror of not being chosen in gym it is conceivable that learning intricately how to butcher an entire hog and render every morsel might give one a feeling of mastery one lacked in childhood it is the greatest immaturity to believe suffering entitles you to something someone wiser and grayer than i once said but in those basements and carpools and playgrounds as i assassinated one by one clandestinely my torturers abandoning their foul normal bodies to compost the astonishing tedium of the wending suburban lanes i was transubstantiating to supernal fame and beauty and such eerie genius that entire books were written about my books in fact it takes a long time to realize your suffering is of very little consequence to anyone but you and by that time the future is already happening and you 're pickling okra and starfruit and foraging for morels in urban forests and suspending artisan mozzarella in little wet nets and crafting small-batch nitrite-free data and maybe even thinking about having children which you swore in a million billion years you would never do
i want to write my lover a poem but a very bad one it 'll include a giant squid and some loose change and cuff links and two blue ferries chugging headfirst on the east river at twenty-six knots and only at the last minute averting disaster through quick thinking and sure reflexes also a bow and arrow and glossy red apple i perch in front of my heart to be honest my lover does n't really like poetry which i guess is why i plan to write such a bad one so he can feel right and strong and good in his beliefs tonight when i go see my lover he ’ ll hold me as i 've never been held except by him and then i 'll have to give him back when you get new things you treat them like glass for a while and then get used to them and manhandle them like everything else i do n't want to give him back but partly it 's not up to me and partly i do n't want to be his old sofa i want to radiate and gleam arrestingly until the certain premature end you can compose a whole life out of these rollercoasters you can be everywhere and nowhere over and over life slapping you in the face till you ’ re newly burnished flat-out gasping and awake
valentine ’ s day breakfast at baker ’ s square laura drinks coffee while i watch andrew who refuses to sit but chooses instead to stay in the restaurant ’ s vestibule where he opens and closes the big double doors over and over again as if he ’ s practicing a grand entrance–entering crossing the threshold and letting the doors close behind him i ’ m thinking it wasn ’ t so long ago i carried my tiny son piggyback through the woods to a waterfall wasn ’ t long ago i kissed laura for the first time wasn ’ t long ago i lived in the house with my dog and sat with my notebook at the kitchen table on sunday morning after working all night– sipping burnt coffee and scratching out lines lighting my hundredth cigarette starting over again determined to write a love poem
o my love sent me a lusty list did not compare me to a summer 's day wrote not the beauty of mine eyes but catalogued in a pretty detailed and comprehensive way the way s in which he was better than me `` more capable of extra- and inter- polation more well-traveled -rounded multi- lingual more practiced in so many matters more physical artistic musical politic al academic i dare say social in many ways and ditto sexual ” and yet these mores undid but his own plea s e and left none-the-less the greater moor of me

when to her lute corinna sings her voice revives the leaden strings and doth in highest notes appear as any challenged echo clear but when she doth of mourning speak ev ’ n with her sighs the strings do break and as her lute doth live or die let by her passion so must i for when of pleasure she doth sing my thoughts enjoy a sudden spring but if she doth of sorrow speak ev ’ n from my heart the strings do break
wanting leads to worse than oddity the bones creak like bamboo in wind and strain toward a better life outside the body the life anything has that isn ’ t human feel the chair under you what does it want does lust bend it silly like a rubber crutch tell a tree about the silky clasp of cunt it won ’ t shift an inch it won ’ t ache to touch let me not cruise for teens in a red sports car or glare too long at what bubbles their clothes let me never hustle file clerks in a bar keep me from the beach when the hot wind blows if i must go mad let it be dignified lock me up where i ’ ll feel like wood where wanting won ’ t send me flopping outside where my bones will shut up where i ’ ll be good

whoever you are holding me now in hand without one thing all will be useless i give you fair warning before you attempt me further i am not what you supposed but far different who is he that would become my follower who would sign himself a candidate for my affections the way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive you would have to give up all else i alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting the whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon ’ d therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further let go your hand from my shoulders put me down and depart on your way or else by stealth in some wood for trial or back of a rock in the open air for in any roof ’ d room of a house i emerge not nor in company and in libraries i lie as one dumb a gawk or unborn or dead but just possibly with you on a high hill first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares or possibly with you sailing at sea or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island here to put your lips upon mine i permit you with the comrade ’ s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband ’ s kiss for i am the new husband and i am the comrade or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip carry me when you go forth over land or sea for thus merely touching you is enough is best and thus touching you would i silently sleep and be carried eternally but these leaves conning you con at peril for these leaves and me you will not understand they will elude you at first and still more afterward i will certainly elude you even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me behold already you see i have escaped from you for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book nor is it by reading it you will acquire it nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few prove victorious nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil perhaps more for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit that which i hinted at therefore release me and depart on your way
why art thou silent is thy love a plant of such weak fibre that the treacherous air of absence withers what was once so fair is there no debt to pay no boon to grant yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant— bound to thy service with unceasing care the mind ’ s least generous wish a mendicant for nought but what thy happiness could spare speak— though this soft warm heart once free to hold a thousand tender pleasures thine and mine be left more desolate more dreary cold than a forsaken bird ’ s-nest filled with snow ‘ mid its own bush of leafless eglantine— speak that my torturing doubts their end may know
comes the time when it ’ s later and onto your table the headwaiter puts the bill and very soon after rings out the sound of lively laughter— picking up change hands like a walrus and a face like a barndoor ’ s and a head without any apparent size nothing but two eyes— so that ’ s you man or me i make it as i can i pick up i go faster than they know— out the door the street like a night any night and no one in sight but then well there she is old friend liz— and she opens the door of her cadillac i step in back and we ’ re gone she turns me on— there are very huge stars man in the sky and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie with a gob of white white ice cream on top of it and i eat it— slowly and while certainly they are laughing at me and all around me is racket of these cats not making it i make it in my wicker basket
about twenty years ago two girls came in where i worked— a bosomy english rose and her friend in specs i could talk to faces in those days sparked the whole shooting-match off and i doubt if ever one had like hers but it was the friend i took out and in seven years after that wrote over four hundred letters gave a ten-guinea ring i got back in the end and met at numerous cathedral cities unknown to the clergy i believe i met beautiful twice she was trying both times so i thought not to laugh parting after about five rehearsals was an agreement that i was too selfish withdrawn and easily bored to love well useful to get that learnt in my wallet are still two snaps of bosomy rose with fur gloves on unlucky charms perhaps
amyntas led me to a grove where all the trees did shade us the sun it self though it had strove it could not have betray ’ d us the place secur ’ d from humane eyes no other fear allows but when the winds that gently rise doe kiss the yielding boughs down there we satt upon the moss and id begin to play a thousand amorous tricks to pass the heat of all the day a many kisses he did give and i return ’ d the same which made me willing to receive that which i dare not name his charming eyes no aid requir ’ d to tell their softning tale on her that was already fir ’ d ’ twas easy to prevaile he did but kiss and clasp me round whilst those his thoughts exprest and lay ’ d me gently on the ground ah who can guess the rest
she goes out to hang the windchime in her nightie and her work boots it ’ s six-thirty in the morning and she ’ s standing on the plastic ice chest tiptoe to reach the crossbeam of the porch windchime in her left hand hammer in her right the nail gripped tight between her teeth but nothing happens next because she ’ s trying to figure out how to switch 1 with 3. she must have been standing in the kitchen coffee in her hand asleep when she heard it—the wind blowing through the sound the windchime wasn ’ t making because it wasn ’ t there no one including me especially anymore believes till death do us part but i can see what i would miss in leaving— the way her ankles go into the work boots as she stands upon the ice chest the problem scrunched into her forehead the little kissable mouth with the nail in it
the wine of love is music and the feast of love is song and when love sits down to the banquet love sits long sits long and ariseth drunken but not with the feast and the wine he reeleth with his own heart that great rich vine
would but indulgent fortune send to me a kind and faithful friend one who to virtue ’ s laws is true and does her nicest rules pursue one pious lib ’ ral just and brave and to his passions not a slave who full of honour void of pride will freely praise and freely chide but not indulge the smallest fault nor entertain one slighting thought who still the same will ever prove will still instruct and still will love in whom i safely may confide and with him all my cares divide who has a large capacious mind join ’ d with a knowledge unconfin ’ d a reason bright a judgement true a wit both quick and solid too who can of all things talk with ease and whose converse will ever please who charm ’ d with wit and inward graces despises fools with tempting faces and still a beauteous mind does prize above the most enchanting eyes i would not envy queens their state nor once desire a happier fate

we would go down to the fish market early to cleanse our vision the fish were silver and scarlet and green and the color of sea the fish were lovelier than even the sea with its silvery scales we thought of return lovely too the women with jars on their heads olive-brown clay shaped softly like thighs we each thought of our women their voices their laughs the way they walked down the street and each of us laughed and it rained on the sea in vineyards that cling to cracks in the earth water softens the leaves and the grape-stems the sky is colored by occasional clouds that redden with pleasure and sun on earth flavors and smells in the sky color and we were alone there we thought of return the way a man thinks of morning after an utterly sleepless night we took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten of fruit all so alive in the musk of the sea we were drunk on the thought of impending return

yesterday the sunshine made the air glow pushing me like a sixteen-year-old to toss my shirt off and run along the river shore splashing in the water wading out to the reeds my heart an ancient yaki drum and i believed more than believed the air beneath trees was female blue dancers i approached and there in the dry leaves in the crisp twigs i turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air sunlight in shrub-weed skirts i knew the dance that would please the gods i knew the dance that would make the river water smile glistening ever silvering i knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors yeah i wanted to write you a poem woman for two days and today it was gray and snowy and overcast about how i startled the mallards from their shallow refuge beneath the russian olive trees and how the male purposely came close to me diverting my attention to it its female love went the other way risking its life that 's what i saw the male fly before the hunter 's rifles circle in sights of hunters and take the shots the roaring rifle blast after blast and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion that 's how i miss you that 's how i wanted to write you a poem since we left you one way me another way i was the male taking with me the hunters that would harm you risking my heart so yours would n't be hurt fronting myself as possible prey so you could escape that kind of poem i am writing you now circling as hunters aim down on me while you rise rise rise into the blue sky and meet me over in the next fields i wanted to write you a poem for two days now to tell you how happy i was seeing a white crane arc between banks in the irrigation ditch with furious efforts its big wings flapping like an awkward nine-year-old kid much taller than the others his age with size twelve sneakers flapping down the basketball court but once the white crane found its balance its wings their grace it glided more perfectly than a ballet dancer 's leap across air all of its feathers ballet dancer 's toes all of its feathers delicate dancers all of its feathers in motion made me believe in myself but more when it rose swooped up the line of ascent up made me think of the curve of your spine how i traced my finger down your spine when you slept your spine is the ascent of the crane toward the sunshine and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips became air a blue cold artic air you glided up in your song of winter love
they did the deed of darkness in their own mid-light he plucked a gray field mouse suddenly in the wind the small dead fly alive helplessly in his beak his cold pride helpless all she receives is life they are terrified they touch life is too much she flies away sorrowing sorrowing she goes alone then her small falcon gone will not rise here again smaller than she he goes claw beneath claw beneath needles and leaning boughs while she the lovelier of these brief differing two floats away sorrowing tall as my love for you and almost lonelier delighted in the delighting i love you in mid-air i love myself the ground the great wings sing nothing lightly lightly fall

just as in the horror movies when someone discovers that the phone calls are coming from inside the house so too i realized that our tender overlapping has been taking place only inside me all that sweetness the love and desire— it ’ s just been me dialing myself then following the ringing to another room to find no one on the line well sometimes a little breathing but more often than not nothing to think that all this time— which would include the boat rides the airport embraces and all the drinks— it ’ s been only me and the two telephones the one on the wall in the kitchen and the extension in the darkened guest room upstairs

after porfirio barba jacob ’ s canción de la vida profunda variable changeable yes there are days when people like us are like that maybe under some other sky something like glory smiles on us maybe there life is clear maybe there things open up on the way the sea stretches out to the horizon— but us we ’ re blown by chance the way wind blows blades of grass lightly blowing them all one way and then there are days when we feel april the fields of april making us feel our bodies longing to be held and fucked into oblivion bodies fertile as a field in april swollen trembling to be touched and under the influences of rains pouring down as if pure spirit poured into us like rain that thing called “ soul ” sprouts and branches and entangles us in lush bowers and thickets of illusion oh yes days come along when we ’ re calm clear —childhood sunsets lagoons rippling sapphire — days when a verse a sudden whistle days when a mountain and bird passing over it days when even our own pain and what we feel it to be like make us smile and sure there are days when we 're so disgusting so sordid to ourselves it ’ s like we ’ re dark stone in the darkness inside flint then nighttime surprises us its lamplight dizzying cold profuse glinting off tossed coins of the good the terrible shining with the gleam of that primal metal and other days come come when women want to cry their come cries and use us as their own days when we ’ re itching to get a woman naked and then we can ’ t face it can ’ t stand it somehow they want us but we don ’ t know how to want them back arm tightening around a waist hand cupping a breast we don ’ t dare touch the roundness of an apple or a pear the round earth spins us off into space and then there arrive days so dismal and stupefied and numb that the idiot soughing of a pine grove sounds like weeping and what some idiot called the soul whines and wails and carries on with what some other idiot calls “ the pain of the world ” and maybe not god himself that absolute fool can make that wind less cutting or make it stop and then there comes certain to come oh my earth i love beyond any of my days a day a day a day when my sail catches the wind and drags the anchor up out of the bottom muck and nothing can withstand that wind blowing by talking to itself talking talking and the day is mine and yours and every living thing ’ s the day when nobody and nothing can keep us from getting up and going no matter who we are the day when our leaving is the same as our arriving
she said what about san francisco another second chance there would be bridges `` shrouded in fog '' streets `` pregnant and glowing '' with traffic dawn she did n't know would maybe `` draw near '' he said dawn draws near everywhere she said a city but a city close to nature a backyard scattered with birds he would n't be able to identify and something exotic rotting avocadoes they 'd play a game on the bridge she 'd lose control of the car he 'd kick her foot away and mash the gas pedal to the floor until she screamed and they 'd have a name for the game and later it would be a story for their kids if they had any kids later but no city is close to nature her body is a white slash beneath the green sheet or `` a sterilized instrument '' last night 's wine dregs are both `` the color of the valley as it ignites '' and in fact that color he pulls the sheets from her again and says he 'll cut their coffins from a wazi'hcaka even if it leaves a gray jay homeless the lumber 's astringency fuck guacamole deep in her knots and sap faster and faster second nature and now a different dawn drawing near
in memoriam liam rector the little boy crying out weenie weenie in self-panicking delight waving his little cock under the banner of the sun seemed pure blake all anarchy and energy an innocence unfrightened of itself that shook the lake's waters and unsettled the strained composures and appointed certainties of whatever absolute speaker had been ranting in my brain peace through strength justice must be ours— so many demon faces in the glass city each pubic triangle seemed under the bathing suits to grow electrical and crackle with a sexual shock that made me turn my face away and who should be there but you my dear lord of misrule blowing smoke in all our faces the clean bullet hole in your forehead above your self-ironic smile do n't let the monkeys stop typing— and after i swam and i was sitting on the bank after the boy and his parents had packed up and gone home i played the noh play over for you in the tape loop of the void where your voice and laughter so casually reside how the mother gone searching for her missing son finds him dancing by the lake and as she tries to hold him he slips through her arms just as she slips through his arms— and as she cries out in perfect pitch in perfect time to the shrieking bamboo flute that her boy has drowned she understands that she too has drowned that she too is a ghost returning to dance as they dance together in a tighter and tighter round
louisiana skies paddle north nodding hello to some exiles displaced by floodwaters so we all putter in the bisque in fretted dresses alleviated by a fan but we have nothing on '' le matin '' in whose rococo frame a curtain sweeps to bare a boudoir a bichon frisé worrying something between paws begging the dulcet glance of the mistress whose push-up cupless corset and up-drawn stocking border what they fall short of per the stern frame rippling like a cloud even the candle angles to get a look in the mirror engloving the scene why it is her slipper the bitch clutches the gentleman 's reverie is elsewhere loitering louisiana stops to admire this engraving by `` n lavreinee '' what a chevalier it makes the smeariest sunset think it 's in a restoration comedy in such humidity chefs defer meringues `` ksar rouge '' `` taos adobe '' '' gulf shrimp '' —a thousand names of softboiled lipsticks fritter english as if it were french meaning meeting no resistance from the flesh

first it is one day without you then two and soon our point moot and our solution diluted and our class action if ever was is no longer suited wherewith i give to looting through the war chest of our past like a wily anne bonny who snatches at plunder or graft but the wreck of that ransack that strongbox our splintering coffer the claptrap bastard of the best we had to offer is sog-soaked and clammy empty but for sand like the knuckle-white cup of my urgent ghastly hands in which nothing but the ghost of love is held damn it to hell
half awake i was imagining a friend ’ s young lover her ash blonde hair the smooth taut skin of twenty i imagined her short legs and dimpled knees the door scraped open but eyes closed i saw nothing the mattress sagged she laid her head on my chest and murmured love against my throat almost humming approaching song so palpable i could hold her only chastely if this was chaste i couldn ’ t move my hand even to caress her freckled shoulder so this is how imagination works i thought sadly and when at last she spoke she spoke with the amused voice of my wife my wife who was at work but also here pleased at the confusion she was causing this is a lesson about flesh isn ’ t it i asked blowfly she whispered on my throat as we made tense pensive love blowfly blowfly
september 14 1915 it 's how she spreads without a sound her scent of orange blossom on the dark of me it is the way she shrouds in mourning black her mother-of-pearl and ivory the way she wears the lace ruff at her throat and how she turns her face quite voiceless self-possessed because she takes the language straight to heart is thrifty with the words she speaks it 's how she is so reticent yet welcoming when she comes out to face my panegyrics the way she says my name mocking and mimicking makes gentle fun yet she 's aware that my unspoken drama is really of the heart though a little silly it 's how when night is deep and at its darkest we linger after dinner vaguely talking and her laughing smile grows fainter and then falls gently on the tablecloth it 's the teasing way she wo n't give me her arm and then allows deep feeling to come with us when we walk out promenading on the hot colonial boulevard because of this your sighing modest style of love i worship you my faithful star who like to cloud yourself about in mourning generous hidden blossom kindly mellowness who have presided over my thirty years with the self-denying singleness a vase has whose half-blown roses wreathe with scent the headboard of a convalescent man cautious nurse shy serving maid dear friend who trembles with the trembling of a child when you revise the reading that we share apprehensive always timid guest at the feast i give my ally humble dove that coos when it is morning in a minor key a key that 's wholly yours may you be blessed modest magnificent you have possessed the highest summit of my heart you who are at once the artist of lowly and most lofty things who bear in your hands my life as if it was your work of art o star and orange blossom may you dwindle gently rocked in an unwedded peace and may you fade out like a morning star which the lightening greenness of a meadow darkens or like a flower that finds transfiguration on the blue west as it might on a simple bed
moringa of the flood bed on the banks of the river tigris a dove on a swaying bough 's mournful cooing has turned me sad her song like the song of the queen of the gathering— when she touches her triple chord you can forget the maestro brother of the caliph al-hádi and when she sings —who was ánjash that camel driver with the mesmerizing chant anyway in hadimát sálma 's direction and sindád i swear it i 'm in love far gone with a girl who lives in ájyadi wrong she lives in the obsidian black of the membrane of my liver through her in a rush of musk and saffron beauty falls into disarray
i beat you with a hazel rod come to me in madness i beat you with a bloodied rod come like an angel i beat you with a rod from heaven come to me like a wild boar ninety-nine serpents— ninety-nine flaming beasts— go to ion slip in by his shirt-collar squat in his heart scald him burn him turn his eyes to my eyes his face to my face his path to my house make him see me in the distance a fine-feathered peacock make him pick me out as basil among weeds make him tease me among the girls like following gold and silver fall in step with my words with my walk with my dance sweet boy do n't send so much longing— send a little less and come with it yourself tuesday basket full of black how did you make me fall in love— did you clip my hair did you steal my footsteps how did you charm me— with the hair of a mad wolf with three straws from the bed with splintered wood with the fairness of eyebrows with a chip off the gate with dark hair from a braid how drive every other love away eagle eagle grow into a flying bird take yourself to ion 's house what you find in his head take in your head what you find in his ears take in your ears what you find in his mouth take in your mouth what you find in his hands take in your wings take that great wrong away in your feathers— and what you find in your head put it in her head and what you find in your feathers put it on the table in their house

the sniper at work over the street corner acts two girls breathless after the dash across radiate heat and bouquets as when ironing silken delicates with one in place of a chignon goosefleshed christmas wheat she explodes rages curses the sniper at the window seemingly i 'm watching a beautiful storm from the other words like a sun-umbrella 's flutterings in the morning on an adriatic beach now and again she flicks her head back just for us as she well knows flicked hair sweetens the air beauty always forthcoming never misses a half-smile as they well know making us happy costs them nothing those half-smiles saying you are n't just one fact among others—not at all not for them—even banishing the hex of that fact if any other woman 's glacial look had magicked it up the air smelt strongly of my distant youth when every boulevard led to the end of the world when life was not yet `` threadbare as a proverb '' now they 're going leaving such tenderness in me as engulfs you when looking too long at the heavens into which snowflakes are swarming so they disappeared chattering not girls but breezes blown lightly surprisingly through the st. john 's heat of siege the st. john 's heat of being

beloved beauty who inspires love in me from afar your face obscured except when your celestial image stirs my heart in sleep or in the fields where light and nature 's laughter shine more lovely— was it maybe you who blessed the innocent age called golden and do you now blithe spirit fly among men or does that miser fate who hides you from us save you for the future no hope of seeing you alive remains for me now except when naked and alone my soul will go down a new street to its unknown home already at the dawn of my dark uncertain day i imagined you a fellow traveler on this arid ground but there 's no thing that resembles you on earth and if someone had a face like yours in act and word she 'd be though something like you far less beautiful in spite of all the suffering fate decreed for human time if there were anyone on earth who truly loved you as my thought depicts you this life for him would be a blessing and i see clearly how your love would lead me still to strive for praise and virtue as i used to in my early years though heaven gave no comfort for our troubles yet with you mortal life would be like what in heaven leads to divinity in the valleys where the song of the weary farmer sounds and when i sit and mourn the illusions of youth fading and on the hills where i recall and grieve for my lost desires and my life 's lost hope i think of you and start to shake if only i in this sad age and unhealthy atmosphere could keep hold of your noble look for since the real thing's missing i must make do with the image whether you are the only one of the eternal ideas eternal wisdom refuses to see arrayed in sensible form to know the pains of mortal life in transitory spoils or if in the supernal spheres another earth from among unnumbered worlds receives you and a near star lovelier than the sun warms you and you breathe benigner ether from here where years are both ill-starred and brief accept this hymn from your unnoticed lover

gives joy only if read in a broken rhythm pausing at every period parting your lips a little at the colons what a pity to die my love to say `` i do n't love you anymore '' with no one listening what a shame the irritated voice the haste the distance between the first passionate whisper and this new timbre how little shame i have to have killed you and put you here beneath the very expanse you created the expanse is a cloth is white is a sheet is a land on which snow has fallen ssh you 'll be alone there no longer on top but under as is proper for the dead as is proper for seed and for lilies yet to sprout you 'll feel something like moving scratches those are birds mice my own bony hands that you adored my tongue with its thirst brr love how painful for me to see you shrunken by this chill so stripped of your gifts in this tomb where i ca n't grieve for you but can only dig down to the earth down to its iron to the fire that now embraces the earth and celebrates me

our fathers have formed a poetry workshop they sit in a circle of disappointment over our fastballs and wives we thought they did n't read our stuff whole anthologies of poems that begin my father never or those that end and he was silent as a carp or those with middles which if you think of the right side as a sketch look like a paunch of beer and worry but secretly with flashlights in the woods they 've read every word and noticed that our nine happy poems have balloons and sex and giraffes inside but not one dad waving hello from the top of a hill at dusk theirs is the revenge school of poetry with titles like '' my yellow sheet lad '' and `` given your mother 's taste for vodka i 'm pretty sure you 're not mine '' they 're not trying to make the poems better so much as sharper or louder more like a fishhook or electrocution as a group they overcome their individual senilities their complete distaste for language how cloying it is how like tears it can be and remember every mention of their long hours at the office or how tired they were when they came home when they were dragged through the door by their shadows i do n't know why it 's so hard to write a simple and kind poem to my father who worked not like a dog dogs sleep most of the day in a ball of wanting to chase something but like a man a man with seven kids and a house to feed whose absence was his presence his present the cheerios the pf flyers who taught me things about trees that they 're the most intricate version of standing up who built a grandfather clock with me so i would know that time is a constructed thing a passing ticking fancy a bomb a bomb that 'll go off soon for him for me and i notice in our fathers poems a reciprocal dwelling on absence that they wonder why we disappeared as soon as we got our licenses why we wanted the rocket cars as if running away from them to kiss girls who looked like mirrors of our mothers was n't fast enough and it turns out they did start to say something to form the words hey or stay but we 'd turned into a door full of sun into the burning leave and were gone before it came to them that it was all right to shout that they should have knocked us down with a hand on our shoulders that they too are mystified by the distance men need in their love
pitiful brother—the dreadful nights i owed him `` i 've got no real involvement in the business i toyed with his weakness so—it was my fault—we wound up back in exile and enslavement '' he saw me as a loser a weird child he added his own prods i answered my satanic doctor jeering and made it out the window all down a landscape crossed by unheard-of music i spun my dreams of a nighttime wealth to come after that more or less healthy pastime i 'd stretch out on a pallet and almost every night soon as i slept my poor brother would rise—dry mouth and bulging eyes the way he 'd dreamt himself —and haul me into the room howling his stupid dream truly convinced i 'd vowed to take him back to his primal state—child of the sun—and so we wandered fed on wine from the caves and gypsy bread me bound to find the place itself and the code
in the northwest corner of dakota i saw a room someone had left a plush sofa returning its button- eyed stare to the glance she gave it over her shoulder the dog too turning in the next room the mattress with mattress stories one after another tumbling out of each spring the window she opened first thing its vista of mile after mile and the windmill hauling its load i saw that and nothing alive— green oil-figured linoleum laid on counters nails of bad craft the ripped blackening edge that scared her more than the bed and the sound of the windmill winning its will from the aquifer night after night the whack of her blade on the block there are houses with too many knives sometimes she said but when june ferned its way in she 'd relent take on its restraint heave again on the stained sheets her burden of child herself a torn girl again combing her hair through fingers bruised by corn shocks sweet juice in the cuts of her life she began to think of the border and mustangs without brand at night they 'd bend over the bed and nuzzle one ride was enough she had sufficient magic to cling to a mane and fare over the windowsill i see where the curtain fell and nobody mended the tear i see where bare feet marked like fossils her pass in the rain when he uncovers fiddleheads by the spring why does he always think of that first sight of her thigh in the peach-colored dress of his hand's searching moss with its red-gold stamens the spring in that arid landscape like something from canaan under his tongue even in old age he 'd ponder the moment lying under the moon forgiving himself her the world that bred their conundrum washed in that rain

there is a white stone cliff over a dropping slope sliced along with bare trees in the center of the cliff is a round dry fountain of polished stone by seizing my whole body up as i clench my hand i am able to open the fountain into a drain revealing below it the sky the trees a brown and uncertain ground this is how my heart works you see this is how love works have some sympathy for the great spasms with which i must open myself to love and close again and open and if i leapt into the fountain there is just no telling i might sever myself clean or crack the gold bloom of my head and i don ’ t know onto what uncertain ground i might fold like a sack
act 2 scene 2 clindor a young picaresque hero has been living by his wits in paris but has now drifted to bordeaux to become the valet of a braggart bravo named matamore he is chiefly employed as a go-between carrying matamore 's amorous messages to the beautiful isabelle—who only suffers the master because she is in love with the messenger clindor sir why so restless is there any need with all your fame for one more glorious deed have you not slain enough bold foes by now and must you have fresh laurels for your brow matamore it 's true i 'm restless and i ca n't decide which of two foes should first be nullified— the mogul emperor or the persian sophy clindor ah let them live a while sir neither trophy would add a great deal to your fame and standing and where 's the army that you 'd be commanding matamore army ah villain coward do you doubt that with this arm alone i 'd wipe them out the mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield and drives divisions from the battlefield my wrath against these rulers needs engage only a piddling portion of my rage with one commandment given to the fates i oust the strongest monarchs from their states thunder 's my cannon my troops the destinies one blow lays low a thousand enemies one breath and all their hopes go up in smoke yet you dare speak of armies what a joke no longer shall a second mars employ you with but a glance you rogue i shall destroy you ... and yet the thought of her whom i adore softens me now and i 'm enraged no more that little archer whom every god obeys forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays observe how my ferocity which hates and hacks and slaughters gently dissipates when i recall my lady and my face is changed by thoughts of beauty love and grace clindor oh sir you have a hundred selves or more you 're as handsome now as you were grim before i ca n't imagine any lady who could stubbornly refuse her heart to you matamore whatever i may have said feel no alarm sometimes i terrify sometimes i charm depending on my humor i inspire men with anxiety women with desire before i had the power to suppress my beauty women gave me much distress when i appeared they swooned in quantity and thousands died each day for love of me with every princess i had many a tryst and every queen came begging to be kissed the ethiopian and the japanese murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas two sultanesses could not but adore me two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me which strained my friendship with the turkish nation clindor their anger could but gild your reputation matamore still all that was more trouble than it was worth it balked my plans for conquering the earth what 's more i tired of it and to deter such nuisances sent word to jupiter that if he could not put a stop to these fond women and their importunities i 'd rise up in a rage and end his reign as ruler of the gods and would obtain for mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder needless to say the coward knuckled under he did as i desired and now you see i 'm handsome only when i choose to be clindor what love notes you 'd receive were that not so matamore do n't bring me any ... unless from her you know what does she say of me clindor today she said that you inspire all hearts with love and dread and that if what you promise her comes true she 'll feel herself a goddess thanks to you matamore back in the times i 've just been speaking of goddesses also pestered me for love and i shall tell you of a strange event which caused confusion without precedent and threw all nature into disarray the sun was powerless to rise one day because that bright much-worshipped deity could not find where the dawn his guide might be he sought her everywhere in cephalus bower in old tithonus bed in memnon 's tower but since aurora nowhere was in sight the day till noontide was as black as night clindor where was the goddess during these alarms matamore in my bedchamber offering me her charms but she gained nothing by such shameless actions my heart was blind to all her bright attractions and all she got by showing off her beauty was a firm command to go and do her duty clindor that curious story sir i now recall i was in mexico where i heard it all they said that persia vexed by the insult to their famous sun god had it in for you matamore i heard as much and would have made them pay but was in transylvania that day where their ambassador hastened to appease my wrath with presents and apologies clindor your brave heart showed them clemency how fine matamore just look my friend upon this face of mine there every human virtue can be found of all the foes i 've stamped into the ground whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside there was not one who did not fall through pride but those who humbly honored my perfection have kept their power through a wise subjection the modest kings of europe are all my vassals i do not sack their towns or wreck their castles i let them reign but it 's another story in africa where i scorched the territory of certain kings who lacked humility and left great deserts there for all to see those endless sands beneath those skies of fire are a great monument to my righteous ire clindor let us revert to love your lady 's here matamore my cursèd rival 's at her side i fear clindor where are you going matamore he is n't brave this dunce and yet he 's vain and could be bold for once perhaps he 'll challenge me from foolish pride merely because he 's at the lady 's side clindor by doing so the fool might come to harm matamore i ca n't be valorous when i 'm full of charm clindor cease to be charming and be terrible sir matamore oh you do n't realize what that would incur i ca n't be terrible by halves you know i 'd slaughter both my mistress and my foe until they part let 's stand aside and wait clindor your prudence like your valor is very great they withdraw to a corner

made it to florida and then i went for a walk the frog pond is half-iced over i chucked a stick at it— still thin on the white side the wind twirled a leaf around like a prepubescent figure skater who ’ s given up her childhood to get here of course the leaf was wearing its practice costume of browns the whole world offed of spangles as i am offed of you why mail snow just to show i could keep it cold in so much heat

because i love you and beneath the uncountable stars i have become the delicate piston threading itself through your chest i want to tell you a story i shouldn ’ t but will and in the meantime neglect love the discordant melody spilling from my ears but attend instead to this tale for a river burns inside my mouth and it wants both purgation and to eternally sip your thousand drippings and in the story is a dog and unnamed it leads to less heartbreak so name him max and in the story are neighborhood kids who spin a yarn about max like i ’ m singing to you except they tell a child a boy who only moments earlier had been wending through sticker bushes to pick juicy rubies whose chin was in fact stained with them and combining in their story the big kids make the boy who shall remain unnamed believe max to be sick and rabid and say his limp and regular smell of piss are just two signs but the worst of it they say is that he ’ ll likely find you in the night and the big kids do not giggle and the boy does not giggle but lets the final berries in his hand drop into the overgrowth at his feet and if i spoke the dream of the unnamed boy i fear my tongue would turn an arm of fire so i won ’ t but know inside the boy ’ s head grew a fire beneath the same stars as you and i love your leg between mine the fine hairs on your upper thigh nearly glistening in the night and the boy the night the incalculable mysteries as he sleeps with a stuffed animal tucked beneath his chin and rolls tight against his brother in their shared bed who rolls away and you know by now there is no salve to quell his mind ’ s roaring machinery and i shouldn ’ t tell you but i will the unnamed boy on the third night of the dreams which harden his soft face puts on pants and a sweatshirt and quietly takes the spade from the den and more quietly leaves his house where upstairs his father lies dreamless and his mother bends her body into his and beneath these same stars love which often when i study them seem to recede like so many of the lies of light the boy walks to the yard where max lives attached to a steel cable spanning the lawn and the boy brings hot dogs which he learned from tom jerry and nearly urinating in his pants he tosses them toward the quiet and crippled thing limping across the lawn the cable whispering above the dew-slick grass and max whimpers and the boy sees a wolf where stands this ratty and sad and groveling dog and beneath these very stars max raises his head to look at the unnamed boy with one glaucous eye nearly glued shut and the other wet from the cool breeze and wheezing max catches the gaze of the boy who sees at last the raw skin on the dog 's flank the quiver of his spindly legs and as max bends his nose to the franks the boy watches him struggle to snatch the meat with gums and bringing the shovel down he bends to lift the meat to max 's toothless mouth and rubs the length of his throat and chin max arching his neck with his eyes closed now and licking the boy 's round face until the boy unchains the dog and stands taking slow steps backward through the wet grass and feels for the first time in days the breath in his lungs which is cool and a little damp spilling over his small lips and he feels again his feet beneath him and the earth beneath them and starlings singing the morning in and the somber movement of beetles chewing the leaves of the white birch glinting in the dark and he notices darling an upturned nest beneath the tree and flips it looking for the blue eggs of robins but finds none and placing a rumpled crimson feather in his mouth slips the spindly thicket into another tree which he climbs to watch the first hint of light glancing above the fields and the boy eventually returns to his thorny fruit bush where an occasional prick leaves on his arm or leg a spot of blood the color of these raspberries and tasting of salt and filling his upturned shirt with them he beams that he could pull from the earth that which might make you smile love which you ’ ll find in the fridge on the bottom shelf behind the milk in the bowl you made with your own lovely hands
the ache of marriage thigh and tongue beloved are heavy with it it throbs in the teeth we look for communion and are turned away beloved each and each it is leviathan and we in its belly looking for joy some joy not to be known outside it two by two in the ark of the ache of it
when the first dark had fallen around them and the leaves were weary of praise in the clear silence beauty found them and shewed them all her ways in the high noon of the heavenly garden where the angels sunned with the birds beauty before their hearts could harden had taught them heavenly words when they fled in the burning weather and nothing dawned but a dream beauty fasted their hands together and cooled them at her stream and when day wearied and night grew stronger and they slept as the beautiful must then she bided a little longer and blossomed from their dust

1. then the long fencerow that years ago had heaved and buckled took on a copper shine in the sunset the dew a garlic haze of cut pastures simmered fields away 2. they were flushed from sex—they were traced with that other body just parted they stood in the length of first fall waiting and their skin that had been so willing 3. delible as ash to a trembling fingertip became its own again one star three nothing good was going to happen night winds lifted themselves out of wheat rows and shook 4. off what had been done so they turned elsewhere her fingers gathered up her collar softly in a bunch and she put on a scarf it was not even cold it was only cool
for i can snore like a bullhorn or play loud music or sit up talking with any reasonably sober irishman and fergus will only sink deeper into his dreamless sleep which goes by all in one flash but let there be that heavy breathing or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house and he will wrench himself awake and make for it on the run—as now we lie together after making love quiet touching along the length of our bodies familiar touch of the long-married and he appears—in his baseball pajamas it happens the neck opening so small he has to screw them on— and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child in the half darkness we look at each other and smile and touch arms across this little startlingly muscled body— this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake this blessing love gives again into our arms

twice or thrice had i lov 'd thee before i knew thy face or name so in a voice so in a shapeless flame angels affect us oft and worshipp 'd be still when to where thou wert i came some lovely glorious nothing i did see but since my soul whose child love is takes limbs of flesh and else could nothing do more subtle than the parent is love must not be but take a body too and therefore what thou wert and who i bid love ask and now that it assume thy body i allow and fix itself in thy lip eye and brow whilst thus to ballast love i thought and so more steadily to have gone with wares which would sink admiration i saw i had love 's pinnace overfraught ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon is much too much some fitter must be sought for nor in nothing nor in things extreme and scatt'ring bright can love inhere then as an angel face and wings of air not pure as it yet pure doth wear so thy love may be my love 's sphere just such disparity as is 'twixt air and angels purity 'twixt women 's love and men 's will ever be

three people drinking out of the bottle in the living room a cold rain quiet as a mirror one of the men stuffs his handkerchief in his coat climbs the stairs with the girl the other man is left sitting at the desk with the wine and the headache turning an old ellington side over in his mind and over he held her like a saxophone when she was his girl her tongue trembling at the reed the man lying next to her now thinks of another woman her white breath idling before he drove off he said something about a spell watching the snow fall on her shoulders the musician crawls back into his horn ancient terrapin at the approach of the wheel

love is no more it died as the mind dies the pure desire relinquishing the blissful form it wore the ample joy and clarity expire regret is vain then do not grieve for what you would efface the sudden failure of the past the pain of its unwilling change and the disgrace leave innocence and modify your nature by the grief which poses to the will indifference that no desire is permanent in sense take leave of me what recompense or pity or deceit can cure or what assumed serenity conceal the mortal loss which we repeat the mind will change and change shall be relief
the sovereign beauty which i do admire witness the world how worthy to be praised the light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire in my frail spirit by her from baseness raised that being now with her huge brightness dazed base thing i can no more endure to view but looking still on her i stand amazed at wondrous sight of so celestial hue so when my tongue would speak her praises due it stopped is with thought 's astonishment and when my pen would write her titles true it ravish 'd is with fancy 's wonderment yet in my heart i then both speak and write the wonder that my wit can not endite
like as a huntsman after weary chase seeing the game from him escap 'd away sits down to rest him in some shady place with panting hounds beguiled of their prey so after long pursuit and vain assay when i all weary had the chase forsook the gentle deer return 'd the self-same way thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook there she beholding me with milder look sought not to fly but fearless still did bide till i in hand her yet half trembling took and with her own goodwill her firmly tied strange thing me seem 'd to see a beast so wild so goodly won with her own will beguil 'd
most happy letters fram 'd by skilful trade with which that happy name was first design 'd the which three times thrice happy hath me made with gifts of body fortune and of mind the first my being to me gave by kind from mother 's womb deriv 'd by due descent the second is my sovereign queen most kind that honour and large richesse to me lent the third my love my life 's last ornament by whom my spirit out of dust was raised to speak her praise and glory excellent of all alive most worthy to be praised ye three elizabeths for ever live that three such graces did unto me give
men call you fair and you do credit it for that your self ye daily such do see but the true fair that is the gentle wit and vertuous mind is much more prais 'd of me for all the rest how ever fair it be shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue but only that is permanent and free from frail corruption that doth flesh ensue that is true beauty that doth argue you to be divine and born of heavenly seed deriv 'd from that fair spirit from whom all true and perfect beauty did at first proceed he only fair and what he fair hath made all other fair like flowers untimely fade
one day i wrote her name upon the strand but came the waves and washed it away again i wrote it with a second hand but came the tide and made my pains his prey `` vain man '' said she `` that dost in vain assay a mortal thing so to immortalize for i myself shall like to this decay and eke my name be wiped out likewise '' `` not so '' quod i `` let baser things devise to die in dust but you shall live by fame my verse your vertues rare shall eternize and in the heavens write your glorious name where whenas death shall all the world subdue our love shall live and later life renew ''
this holy season fit to fast and pray men to devotion ought to be inclin 'd therefore i likewise on so holy day for my sweet saint some service fit will find her temple fair is built within my mind in which her glorious image placed is on which my thoughts do day and night attend like sacred priests that never think amiss there i to her as th author of my bliss will build an altar to appease her ire and on the same my heart will sacrifice burning in flames of pure and chaste desire the which vouchsafe o goddess to accept amongst thy dearest relics to be kept
ah whither love wilt thou now carry me what wontless fury dost thou now inspire into my feeble breast too full of thee whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire thou in me kindlest much more great desire and up aloft above my strength dost raise the wondrous matter of my fire to praise that as i erst in praise of thine own name so now in honour of thy mother dear an honourable hymn i eke should frame and with the brightness of her beauty clear the ravish 'd hearts of gazeful men might rear to admiration of that heavenly light from whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might thereto do thou great goddess queen of beauty mother of love and of all world 's delight without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light t illuminate my dim and dulled eyne and beautify this sacred hymn of thine that both to thee to whom i mean it most and eke to her whose fair immortal beam hath darted fire into my feeble ghost that now it wasted is with woes extreme it may so please that she at length will stream some dew of grace into my withered heart after long sorrow and consuming smart what time this world 's great workmaster did cast to make all things such as we now behold it seems that he before his eyes had plac'd a goodly pattern to whose perfect mould he fashion 'd them as comely as he could that now so fair and seemly they appear as nought may be amended anywhere that wondrous pattern wheresoe'er it be whether in earth laid up in secret store or else in heaven that no man may it see with sinful eyes for fear it to deflore is perfect beauty which all men adore whose face and feature doth so much excel all mortal sense that none the same may tell thereof as every earthly thing partakes or more or less by influence divine so it more fair accordingly it makes and the gross matter of this earthly mine which clotheth it thereafter doth refine doing away the dross which dims the light of that fair beam which therein is empight for through infusion of celestial power the duller earth it quick'neth with delight and lifeful spirits privily doth pour through all the parts that to the looker 's sight they seem to please that is thy sovereign might o cyprian queen which flowing from the beam of thy bright star thou into them dost stream that is the thing which giveth pleasant grace to all things fair that kindleth lively fire light of thy lamp which shining in the face thence to the soul darts amorous desire and robs the hearts of those which it admire therewith thou pointest thy son 's poison 'd arrow that wounds the life and wastes the inmost marrow how vainly then do idle wits invent that beauty is nought else but mixture made of colours fair and goodly temp'rament of pure complexions that shall quickly fade and pass away like to a summer 's shade or that it is but comely composition of parts well measur 'd with meet disposition hath white and red in it such wondrous power that it can pierce through th eyes unto the heart and therein stir such rage and restless stour as nought but death can stint his dolour 's smart or can proportion of the outward part move such affection in the inward mind that it can rob both sense and reason blind why do not then the blossoms of the field which are array 'd with much more orient hue and to the sense most dainty odours yield work like impression in the looker 's view or why do not fair pictures like power shew in which oft-times we nature see of art excell 'd in perfect limning every part but ah believe me there is more than so that works such wonders in the minds of men i that have often prov 'd too well it know and whoso list the like assays to ken shall find by trial and confess it then that beauty is not as fond men misdeem an outward shew of things that only seem for that same goodly hue of white and red with which the cheeks are sprinkled shall decay and those sweet rosy leaves so fairly spread upon the lips shall fade and fall away to that they were even to corrupted clay that golden wire those sparkling stars so bright shall turn to dust and lose their goodly light but that fair lamp from whose celestial ray that light proceeds which kindleth lovers fire shall never be extinguish 'd nor decay but when the vital spirits do expire unto her native planet shall retire for it is heavenly born and can not die being a parcel of the purest sky for when the soul the which derived was at first out of that great immortal spright by whom all live to love whilom did pass down from the top of purest heaven 's height to be embodied here it then took light and lively spirits from that fairest star which lights the world forth from his fiery car which power retaining still or more or less when she in fleshly seed is eft enraced through every part she doth the same impress according as the heavens have her graced and frames her house in which she will be placed fit for herself adorning it with spoil of th heavenly riches which she robb 'd erewhile thereof it comes that these fair souls which have the most resemblance of that heavenly light frame to themselves most beautiful and brave their fleshly bower most fit for their delight and the gross matter by a sovereign might tempers so trim that it may well be seen a palace fit for such a virgin queen so every spirit as it is most pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body doth procure to habit in and it more fairly dight with cheerful grace and amiable sight for of the soul the body form doth take for soul is form and doth the body make therefore wherever that thou dost behold a comely corpse with beauty fair endued know this for certain that the same doth hold a beauteous soul with fair conditions thewed fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed for all that fair is is by nature good that is a sign to know the gentle blood yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind dwells in deformed tabernacle drown 'd either by chance against the course of kind or through unaptness in the substance found which it assumed of some stubborn ground that will not yield unto her form 's direction but is deform 'd with some foul imperfection and oft it falls ay me the more to rue that goodly beauty albe heavenly born is foul abus 'd and that celestial hue which doth the world with her delight adorn made but the bait of sin and sinners scorn whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it but every one doth seek but to deprave it yet nathëmore is that fair beauty 's blame but theirs that do abuse it unto ill nothing so good but that through guilty shame may be corrupt and wrested unto will natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still however flesh `` e s fault it filthy make for things immortal no corruption take but ye fair dames the world 's dear ornaments and lively images of heaven 's light let not your beams with such disparagements be dimm 'd and your bright glory dark'ned quite but mindful still of your first country 's sight do still preserve your first informed grace whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face loathe that foul blot that hellish firebrand disloyal lust fair beauty 's foulest blame that base affections which your ears would bland commend to you by love 's abused name but is indeed the bondslave of defame which will the garland of your glory mar and quench the light of your bright shining star but gentle love that loyal is and true will more illumine your resplendent ray and add more brightness to your goodly hue from light of his pure fire which by like way kindled of yours your likeness doth display like as two mirrors by oppos 'd reflection do both express the face 's first impression therefore to make your beauty more appear it you behoves to love and forth to lay that heavenly riches which in you ye bear that men the more admire their fountain may for else what booteth that celestial ray if it in darkness be enshrined ever that it of loving eyes be viewed never but in your choice of loves this well advise that likest to yourselves ye them select the which your forms first source may sympathize and with like beauty 's parts be inly deckt for if you loosely love without respect it is no love but a discordant war whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar for love is a celestial harmony of likely hearts compos 'd of stars concent which join together in sweet sympathy to work each other 's joy and true content which they have harbour 'd since their first descent out of their heavenly bowers where they did see and know each other here belov 'd to be then wrong it were that any other twain should in love 's gentle band combined be but those whom heaven did at first ordain and made out of one mould the more t agree for all that like the beauty which they see straight do not love for love is not so light as straight to burn at first beholder 's sight but they which love indeed look otherwise with pure regard and spotless true intent drawing out of the object of their eyes a more refined form which they present unto their mind void of all blemishment which it reducing to her first perfection beholdeth free from flesh 's frail infection and then conforming it unto the light which in itself it hath remaining still of that first sun yet sparkling in his sight thereof he fashions in his higher skill an heavenly beauty to his fancy 's will and it embracing in his mind entire the mirror of his own thought doth admire which seeing now so inly fair to be as outward it appeareth to the eye and with his spirit 's proportion to agree he thereon fixeth all his fantasy and fully setteth his felicity counting it fairer than it is indeed and yet indeed her fairness doth exceed for lovers eyes more sharply sighted be than other men 's and in dear love 's delight see more than any other eyes can see through mutual receipt of beam `` e s bright which carry privy message to the spright and to their eyes that inmost fair display as plain as light discovers dawning day therein they see through amorous eye-glances armies of loves still flying to and fro which dart at them their little fiery lances whom having wounded back again they go carrying compassion to their lovely foe who seeing her fair eyes so sharp effect cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect in which how many wonders do they rede to their conceit that others never see now of her smiles with which their souls they feed like gods with nectar in their banquets free now of her looks which like to cordials be but when her words embássade forth she sends lord how sweet music that unto them lends sometimes upon her forehead they behold a thousand graces masking in delight sometimes within her eyelids they unfold ten thousand sweet belgards which to their sight do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night but on her lips like rosy buds in may so many millions of chaste pleasures play all those o cytherea and thousands more thy handmaids be which do on thee attend to deck thy beauty with their dainties store that may it more to mortal eyes commend and make it more admir 'd of foe and friend that in men 's hearts thou may'st thy throne install and spread thy lovely kingdom over all then iö triumph o great beauty 's queen advance the banner of thy conquest high that all this world the which thy vassals bene may draw to thee and with due fealty adore the power of thy great majesty singing this hymn in honour of thy name compil 'd by me which thy poor liegeman am in lieu whereof grant o great sovereign that she whose conquering beauty doth captive my trembling heart in her eternal chain one drop of grace at length will to me give that i her bounden thrall by her may live and this same life which first fro me she reaved may owe to her of whom i it received and you fair venus darling my dear dread fresh flower of grace great goddess of my life when your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read deign to let fall one drop of due relief that may recure my heart 's long pining grief and shew what wondrous power your beauty hath that can restore a damned wight from death
and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay for shame to save thee from the blame of all my grief and grame and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay and wilt thou leave me thus that hath loved thee so long in wealth and woe among and is thy heart so strong as for to leave me thus say nay say nay and wilt thou leave me thus that hath given thee my heart never for to depart nother for pain nor smart and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay and wilt thou leave me thus and have no more pity of him that loveth thee hélas thy cruelty and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay
but do not let us quarrel any more no my lucrezia bear with me for once sit down and all shall happen as you wish you turn your face but does it bring your heart i 'll work then for your friend 's friend never fear treat his own subject after his own way fix his own time accept too his own price and shut the money into this small hand when next it takes mine will it tenderly oh i 'll content him —but to-morrow love i often am much wearier than you think this evening more than usual and it seems as if—forgive now—should you let me sit here by the window with your hand in mine and look a half-hour forth on fiesole both of one mind as married people use quietly quietly the evening through i might get up to-morrow to my work cheerful and fresh as ever let us try to-morrow how you shall be glad for this your soft hand is a woman of itself and mine the man 's bared breast she curls inside do n't count the time lost neither you must serve for each of the five pictures we require it saves a model so keep looking so— my serpentining beauty rounds on rounds —how could you ever prick those perfect ears even to put the pearl there oh so sweet— my face my moon my everybody 's moon which everybody looks on and calls his and i suppose is looked on by in turn while she looks—no one 's very dear no less you smile why there 's my picture ready made there 's what we painters call our harmony a common greyness silvers everything — all in a twilight you and i alike —you at the point of your first pride in me that 's gone you know —but i at every point my youth my hope my art being all toned down to yonder sober pleasant fiesole there 's the bell clinking from the chapel-top that length of convent-wall across the way holds the trees safer huddled more inside the last monk leaves the garden days decrease and autumn grows autumn in everything eh the whole seems to fall into a shape as if i saw alike my work and self and all that i was born to be and do a twilight-piece love we are in god 's hand how strange now looks the life he makes us lead so free we seem so fettered fast we are i feel he laid the fetter let it lie this chamber for example—turn your head— all that 's behind us you do n't understand nor care to understand about my art but you can hear at least when people speak and that cartoon the second from the door —it is the thing love so such things should be— behold madonna —i am bold to say i can do with my pencil what i know what i see what at bottom of my heart i wish for if i ever wish so deep— do easily too—when i say perfectly i do not boast perhaps yourself are judge who listened to the legate 's talk last week and just as much they used to say in france at any rate 't is easy all of it no sketches first no studies that 's long past i do what many dream of all their lives —dream strive to do and agonize to do and fail in doing i could count twenty such on twice your fingers and not leave this town who strive—you do n't know how the others strive to paint a little thing like that you smeared carelessly passing with your robes afloat — yet do much less so much less someone says i know his name no matter —so much less well less is more lucrezia i am judged there burns a truer light of god in them in their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain heart or whate'er else than goes on to prompt this low-pulsed forthright craftsman 's hand of mine their works drop groundward but themselves i know reach many a time a heaven that 's shut to me enter and take their place there sure enough though they come back and can not tell the world my works are nearer heaven but i sit here the sudden blood of these men at a word— praise them it boils or blame them it boils too i painting from myself and to myself know what i do am unmoved by men 's blame or their praise either somebody remarks morello 's outline there is wrongly traced his hue mistaken what of that or else rightly traced and well ordered what of that speak as they please what does the mountain care ah but a man 's reach should exceed his grasp or what 's a heaven for all is silver-grey placid and perfect with my art the worse i know both what i want and what might gain and yet how profitless to know to sigh '' had i been two another and myself '' our head would have o'erlooked the world '' no doubt yonder 's a work now of that famous youth the urbinate who died five years ago 't is copied george vasari sent it me well i can fancy how he did it all pouring his soul with kings and popes to see reaching that heaven might so replenish him above and through his art—for it gives way that arm is wrongly put—and there again— a fault to pardon in the drawing 's lines its body so to speak its soul is right he means right—that a child may understand still what an arm and i could alter it but all the play the insight and the stretch— out of me out of me and wherefore out had you enjoined them on me given me soul we might have risen to rafael i and you nay love you did give all i asked i think— more than i merit yes by many times but had you—oh with the same perfect brow and perfect eyes and more than perfect mouth and the low voice my soul hears as a bird the fowler 's pipe and follows to the snare — had you with these the same but brought a mind some women do so had the mouth there urged '' god and the glory never care for gain `` the present by the future what is that `` live for fame side by side with agnolo `` rafael is waiting up to god all three '' i might have done it for you so it seems perhaps not all is as god over-rules beside incentives come from the soul 's self the rest avail not why do i need you what wife had rafael or has agnolo in this world who can do a thing will not and who would do it can not i perceive yet the will 's somewhat—somewhat too the power— and thus we half-men struggle at the end god i conclude compensates punishes 't is safer for me if the award be strict that i am something underrated here poor this long while despised to speak the truth i dared not do you know leave home all day for fear of chancing on the paris lords the best is when they pass and look aside but they speak sometimes i must bear it all well may they speak that francis that first time and that long festal year at fontainebleau i surely then could sometimes leave the ground put on the glory rafael 's daily wear in that humane great monarch 's golden look — one finger in his beard or twisted curl over his mouth 's good mark that made the smile one arm about my shoulder round my neck the jingle of his gold chain in my ear i painting proudly with his breath on me all his court round him seeing with his eyes such frank french eyes and such a fire of souls profuse my hand kept plying by those hearts — and best of all this this this face beyond this in the background waiting on my work to crown the issue with a last reward a good time was it not my kingly days and had you not grown restless ... but i know— 'tis done and past 't was right my instinct said too live the life grew golden and not grey and i 'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt out of the grange whose four walls make his world how could it end in any other way you called me and i came home to your heart the triumph was—to reach and stay there since i reached it ere the triumph what is lost let my hands frame your face in your hair 's gold you beautiful lucrezia that are mine `` rafael did this andrea painted that '' the roman 's is the better when you pray '' but still the other 's virgin was his wife— '' men will excuse me i am glad to judge both pictures in your presence clearer grows my better fortune i resolve to think for do you know lucrezia as god lives said one day agnolo his very self to rafael i have known it all these years when the young man was flaming out his thoughts upon a palace-wall for rome to see too lifted up in heart because of it '' friend there 's a certain sorry little scrub '' goes up and down our florence none cares how '' who were he set to plan and execute '' as you are pricked on by your popes and kings '' would bring the sweat into that brow of yours '' to rafael 's —and indeed the arm is wrong i hardly dare yet only you to see give the chalk here—quick thus the line should go ay but the soul he 's rafael rub it out still all i care for if he spoke the truth what he why who but michel agnolo do you forget already words like those if really there was such a chance so lost — is whether you're—not grateful—but more pleased well let me think so and you smile indeed this hour has been an hour another smile if you would sit thus by me every night i should work better do you comprehend i mean that i should earn more give you more see it is settled dusk now there 's a star morello 's gone the watch-lights show the wall the cue-owls speak the name we call them by come from the window love —come in at last inside the melancholy little house we built to be so gay with god is just king francis may forgive me oft at nights when i look up from painting eyes tired out the walls become illumined brick from brick distinct instead of mortar fierce bright gold that gold of his i did cement them with let us but love each other must you go that cousin here again he waits outside must see you—you and not with me those loans more gaming debts to pay you smiled for that well let smiles buy me have you more to spend while hand and eye and something of a heart are left me work 's my ware and what 's it worth i 'll pay my fancy only let me sit the grey remainder of the evening out idle you call it and muse perfectly how i could paint were i but back in france one picture just one more—the virgin 's face not yours this time i want you at my side to hear them—that is michel agnolo— judge all i do and tell you of its worth will you to-morrow satisfy your friend i take the subjects for his corridor finish the portrait out of hand—there there and throw him in another thing or two if he demurs the whole should prove enough to pay for this same cousin 's freak beside what 's better and what 's all i care about get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff love does that please you ah but what does he the cousin what does he to please you more i am grown peaceful as old age to-night i regret little i would change still less since there my past life lies why alter it the very wrong to francis —it is true i took his coin was tempted and complied and built this house and sinned and all is said my father and my mother died of want well had i riches of my own you see how one gets rich let each one bear his lot they were born poor lived poor and poor they died and i have laboured somewhat in my time and not been paid profusely some good son paint my two hundred pictures—let him try no doubt there 's something strikes a balance yes you loved me quite enough it seems to-night this must suffice me here what would one have in heaven perhaps new chances one more chance— four great walls in the new jerusalem meted on each side by the angel 's reed for leonard rafael agnolo and me to cover—the three first without a wife while i have mine so—still they overcome because there 's still lucrezia —as i choose again the cousin 's whistle go my love
it was many and many a year ago in a kingdom by the sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of annabel lee and this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me i was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love— i and my annabel lee— with a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven coveted her and me and this was the reason that long ago in this kingdom by the sea a wind blew out of a cloud chilling my beautiful annabel lee so that her highborn kinsmen came and bore her away from me to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea the angels not half so happy in heaven went envying her and me— yes —that was the reason as all men know in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud by night chilling and killing my annabel lee but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we— of many far wiser than we— and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful annabel lee and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes of the beautiful annabel lee and so all the night-tide i lie down by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride in her sepulchre there by the sea— in her tomb by the sounding sea
she was changing on the inside it was true what had been written the new syntax of love both sucked and burned the secret clung around them she took in the smell walking down a road to nowhere every sound was relevant the sun fell behind them now he seemed strangely moved she would take her clothes off for the camera she said in plain english but she wasn ’ t holding that snake
speak to her heart that manic force when wits depart forbids remorse dream with her dreaming until her lust seems to her seeming an act of trust do without doing love ’ s wilful potion veils the ensuing and brief commotion
why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples why do you dim yourself with folded silks do you not see that i can buy brocades in any draper ’ s shop and that i am choked in the twilight of all these colors how pale you would be and startling— how quiet but your curves would spring upward like a clear jet of flung water you would quiver like a shot-up spray of water you would waver and relapse and tremble and i too should tremble watching murex-dyes and tinsel— and yet i think i could bear your beauty unshaded
love has gone and left me and the days are all alike eat i must and sleep i will — and would that night were here but ah — to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike would that it were day again — with twilight near love has gone and left me and i do n't know what to do this or that or what you will is all the same to me but all the things that i begin i leave before i 'm through — there 's little use in anything as far as i can see love has gone and left me — and the neighbors knock and borrow and life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse — and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow there 's this little street and this little house
loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show that she dear she might take some pleasure of my pain — pleasure might cause her read reading might make her know knowledge might pity win and pity grace obtain — i sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe studying inventions fine her wits to entertain oft turning others leaves to see if thence would flow some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn 'd brain but words came halting forth wanting invention 's stay invention nature 's child fled step-dame study 's blows and others feet still seem 'd but strangers in my way thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes biting my truant pen beating myself for spite '' fool '' said my muse to me `` look in thy heart and write ''

the curious wits seeing dull pensiveness bewray itself in my long-settl 'd eyes whence those same fumes of melancholy rise with idle pains and missing aim do guess some that know how my spring i did address deem that my muse some fruit of knowledge plies others because the prince my service tries think that i think state errors to redress but harder judges judge ambition 's ragei scourge of itself still climbing slipp'ry placei holds my young brain captiv 'd in golden cage o fool or over-wise alas the race of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start but only stella 's eyes and stella 's heart

when nature made her chief work stella 's eyes in colour black why wrapt she beams so bright would she in beamy black like painter wise frame daintiest lustre mix 'd of shades and light or did she else that sober hue devise in object best to knit and strength our sight lest if no veil these brave gleams did disguise they sunlike should more dazzle than delight or would she her miraculous power show that whereas black seems beauty 's contrary she even in black doth make all beauties flow both so and thus she minding love should be plac 'd ever there gave him this mourning weed to honour all their deaths who for her bleed
who will in fairest book of nature know how virtue may best lodg 'd in beauty be let him but learn of love to read in thee stella those fair lines which true goodness show there shall he find all vices overthrow not by rude force but sweetest sovereignty of reason from whose light those night-birds fly that inward sun in thine eyes shineth so and not content to be perfection 's heir thyself dost strive all minds that way to move who mark in thee what is in thee most fair so while thy beauty draws thy heart to love as fast thy virtue bends that love to good but `` ah '' desire still cries `` give me some food ''

can these movements which move themselves be the substance of my attraction where does this thin green silk come from that covers my body surely any woman wearing such fabrics would move her body just to feel them touching every part of her yet most of the women frown or look away or laugh stiffly they are afraid of these materials and these movements in some way the psychologists would say they are afraid of themselves somehow perhaps awakening too much desire— that their men could never satisfy so they keep themselves laced and buttoned and made up in hopes that the framework will keep them stiff enough not to feel the whole register in hopes that they will not have to experience that unquenchable desire for rhythm and contact if a snake glided across this floor most of them would faint or shrink away yet that movement could be their own that smooth movement frightens them— awakening ancestors and relatives to the tips of the arms and toes so my bare feet and my thin green silks my bells and finger cymbals offend them—frighten their old-young bodies while the men simper and leer— glad for the vicarious experience and exercise they do not realize how i scorn them or how i dance for their frightened unawakened sweet women
oh come my lad or go my lad and love me if you like i hardly hear the door shut or the knocker strike oh bring me gifts or beg me gifts and wed me if you will i 'd make a man a good wife sensible and still and why should i be cold my lad and why should you repine because i love a dark head that never will be mine i might as well be easing you as lie alone in bed and waste the night in wanting a cruel dark head you might as well be calling yours what never will be his and one of us be happy there 's few enough as is
sometimes up out of this land a legend begins to move is it a coming near of something under love love is of the earth only the surface a map of roads leading wherever go miles or little bushes nod not so the legend under fixed inexorable deep as the darkest mine the thick rocks wo n't tell as fire burns the leaf and out of the green appears the vein in the center line and the legend veins under there so the world happens twice— once what we see it as second it legends itself deep the way it is
when i see birches bend to left and right across the lines of straighter darker trees i like to think some boy 's been swinging them but swinging does n't bend them down to stay as ice-storms do often you must have seen them loaded with ice a sunny winter morning after a rain they click upon themselves as the breeze rises and turn many-colored as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel soon the sun 's warmth makes them shed crystal shells shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— such heaps of broken glass to sweep away you 'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load and they seem not to break though once they are bowed so low for long they never right themselves you may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards trailing their leaves on the ground like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads to dry in the sun but i was going to say when truth broke in with all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm i should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows— some boy too far from town to learn baseball whose only play was what he found himself summer or winter and could play alone one by one he subdued his father 's trees by riding them down over and over again until he took the stiffness out of them and not one but hung limp not one was left for him to conquer he learned all there was to learn about not launching out too soon and so not carrying the tree away clear to the ground he always kept his poise to the top branches climbing carefully with the same pains you use to fill a cup up to the brim and even above the brim then he flung outward feet first with a swish kicking his way down through the air to the ground so was i once myself a swinger of birches and so i dream of going back to be it 's when i 'm weary of considerations and life is too much like a pathless wood where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs broken across it and one eye is weeping from a twig 's having lashed across it open i 'd like to get away from earth awhile and then come back to it and begin over may no fate willfully misunderstand me and half grant what i wish and snatch me away not to return earth 's the right place for love i do n't know where it 's likely to go better i 'd like to go by climbing a birch tree and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk toward heaven till the tree could bear no more but dipped its top and set me down again that would be good both going and coming back one could do worse than be a swinger of birches
my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a water 'd shoot my heart is like an apple-tree whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit my heart is like a rainbow shell that paddles in a halcyon sea my heart is gladder than all these because my love is come to me raise me a dais of silk and down hang it with vair and purple dyes carve it in doves and pomegranates and peacocks with a hundred eyes work it in gold and silver grapes in leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys because the birthday of my life is come my love is come to me
for jim hendrix hoodoo from his natural born he frightens all the witches and the dragons in their lair he cues the clear blue daylight and he gives the night its dare he flaps his wings for warning and he struts atop a mare for when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee in his coal black plumage and his bright red crown and his golden beaked fury and his calculated frown in his webbed footed glory he sends jehovah down for when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee o they dance around the fire and they boil the gall of wolves and they sing their strange crude melodies and play their weirder tunes and the villagers close their windows and the grave- yard starts to heave and the cross wont help their victims and the screaming fills the night and the young girls die with open eyes and the skies are lavender light but when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee well the sheriff is getting desperate as they go their nature ’ s way killing cattle smothering infants slaughtering those who block their way and the countryside swarms with numbness as their magic circle grows but when he crows they tremble and when he comes they flee posting hex-signs on their wagons simple worried farmers pray passing laws and faking justice only feed the witches brew violet stones are rendered helpless drunken priests are helpless too but when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee we have seen them in their ritual we have catalogued their crimes we are weary of their torture but we can not bring them down their ancient hoodoo enemy who does the work the trick strikes peril in their dead fiend ’ s hearts and pecks their flesh to quick love him feed him he will never let you down for when he crows they quiver and when he comes they frown
pale with the blue of high zeniths shimmered over with silver brocaded in smooth running patterns a soft stuff with dark knotted fringes it lies there warm from a woman ’ s soft shoulders and my fingers close on it caressing where is she the woman who wore it the scent of her lingers and drugs me a languor fire-shotted runs through me and i crush the scarf down on my face and gulp in the warmth and the blueness and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens around me are columns of marble and a diapered sun-flickered pavement rose-leaves blow and patter against it below the stone steps a lute tinkles a jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor a big-bellied frog hops through the sunlight and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin sunk in the black and white marble the west wind has lifted a scarf on the seat close beside me the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour she draws it more closely about her and it ripples beneath her slight stirring her kisses are sharp buds of fire and i burn back against her a jewel hard and white a stalked flaming flower till i break to a handful of cinders and open my eyes to the scarf shining blue in the afternoon sunshine how loud clocks can tick when a room is empty and one is alone

a boat beneath a sunny sky lingering onward dreamily in an evening of july — children three that nestle near eager eye and willing ear pleased a simple tale to hear — long has paled that sunny sky echoes fade and memories die autumn frosts have slain july still she haunts me phantomwise alice moving under skies never seen by waking eyes children yet the tale to hear eager eye and willing ear lovingly shall nestle near in a wonderland they lie dreaming as the days go by dreaming as the summers die ever drifting down the stream — lingering in the golden gleam — life what is it but a dream
my love looks like a girl to-night but she is old the plaits that lie along her pillow are not gold but threaded with filigree silver and uncanny cold she looks like a young maiden since her brow is smooth and fair her cheeks are very smooth her eyes are closed she sleeps a rare still winsome sleep so still and so composed nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her dreams of perfect things she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream and her dead mouth sings by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings
by the dry road the fathers cough and spit this is their room they are the ones who hung that bloody sun upon the southern wall and crushed the armored beetle to the floor the father ’ s skin is seamed and dry the map of that wild region where they drained the swamp and set provision out that they might sit of history the cracked precipitate until the glass be shattered and the sun descend to burn the prosperous flesh away of the filthy world so vilely fathered on the fathers such black cinders sitting there old pioneers what lecheries remain when schoolgirls pass what whispers of their skirts cold gleams of flesh solicit in your veined and gemlike eyes the custom of desire none now their eyes are sunk in ancient flesh and the sarcastic triumph of the mind they now enjoy letting their lust alone who may have kin but have no longer kind neither tomorrow ’ s monstrous tumor nor the reformation of the past they wish who hold in silent colloquy the world a shrivelled apple in the hand of god they hang at night their somber flags aloft and through the amorous dark pursue their theme of common images that sleep may show them done with all disasters but the one
bright star would i were stedfast as thou art— not in lone splendour hung aloft the night and watching with eternal lids apart like nature 's patient sleepless eremite the moving waters at their priestlike task of pure ablution round earth 's human shores or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask of snow upon the mountains and the moors— no—yet still stedfast still unchangeable pillow 'd upon my fair love 's ripening breast to feel for ever its soft fall and swell awake for ever in a sweet unrest still still to hear her tender-taken breath and so live ever—or else swoon to death

for marian before you i was living on an island and all around the seas of that lonely coast cast up their imitation jewels cast their fables and enigmas questioning sly i never solved them or ever even heard being perfect in innocence unconscious of self such ignorance of history was all my wealth— a geographer sleeping in the shadow of virgins but though my maps were made of private countries i was a foreigner in all of them after you had come for when you spoke it was with a human tongue and never understood by my land-locked gentry then did the sun shake down a million bells and birds bloom on bough in wildest song phlegmatic hills went shivering with flame the chestnut trees were manic at their deepest boles it is little strange that nature was riven in her frame at this second creation known to every lover— how we are shaped and shape ourselves in the desires of the other within the tolerance of human change out of the spring ’ s innocence this revolution created on a kiss announced the second season the summer of private history of growth through whose sweet sessions the trees lift toward the sun each leaf a revelation our bodies coupled in the moonlight ’ s album proclaimed our love against the outlaw times whose signature was written in the burning towns your face against the night was my medallion your coming forth aroused unlikely trumpets in the once-tame heart they heralded your worth who are my lodestar my bright and ultimate north marrying all points of my personal compass this is the love that now invents my fear which nuzzles me like a puppy each violent day it is poor comfort that the mind comes saying what is one slim girl to the peoples ’ wars still my dice are loaded having had such luck having your love my life would still be whole though i should die tomorrow i have lived it all —and love is never love that can not give love up
let it not your wonder move less your laughter that i love though i now write fifty years i have had and have my peers poets though divine are men some have lov 'd as old again and it is not always face clothes or fortune gives the grace or the feature or the youth but the language and the truth with the ardour and the passion gives the lover weight and fashion if you then will read the story first prepare you to be sorry that you never knew till now either whom to love or how but be glad as soon with me when you know that this is she of whose beauty it was sung she shall make the old man young keep the middle age at stay and let nothing high decay till she be the reason why all the world for love may die
see the chariot at hand here of love wherein my lady rideth each that draws is a swan or a dove and well the car love guideth as she goes all hearts do duty unto her beauty and enamour 'd do wish so they might but enjoy such a sight that they still were to run by her side through swords through seas whither she would ride do but look on her eyes they do light all that love 's world compriseth do but look on her hair it is bright as love 's star when it riseth do but mark her forehead 's smoother than words that soothe her and from her arched brows such a grace sheds itself through the face as alone there triumphs to the life all the gain all the good of the elements strife have you seen but a bright lily grow before rude hands have touch 'd it ha you mark 'd but the fall o the snow before the soil hath smutch 'd it ha you felt the wool o the beaver or swan 's down ever or have smelt o the bud o the briar or the nard in the fire or have tasted the bag of the bee oh so white oh so soft oh so sweet is she
allegiance is assigned forever when the mind chooses and stamps the will thus i must love you still through good and ill. but though we can not part we may retract the heart and build such privacies as self-regard agrees conduce to ease so manners will repair the ravage of despair which generous love invites preferring quiet nights to vain delights
love what ailed thee to leave life that was made lovely we thought with love what sweet visions of sleep lured thee away down from the light above what strange faces of dreams voices that called hands that were raised to wave lured or led thee alas out of the sun down to the sunless grave ah thy luminous eyes once was their light fed with the fire of day now their shadowy lids cover them close hush them and hide away ah thy snow-coloured hands once were they chains mighty to bind me fast now no blood in them burns mindless of love senseless of passion past ah thy beautiful hair so was it once braided for me for me now for death is it crowned only for death lover and lord of thee sweet the kisses of death set on thy lips colder are they than mine colder surely than past kisses that love poured for thy lips as wine lov'st thou death is his face fairer than love 's brighter to look upon seest thou light in his eyes light by which love 's pales and is overshone lo the roses of death grey as the dust chiller of leaf than snow why let fall from thy hand love 's that were thine roses that loved thee so large red lilies of love sceptral and tall lovely for eyes to see thornless blossom of love full of the sun fruits that were reared for thee now death 's poppies alone circle thy hair girdle thy breasts as white bloodless blossoms of death leaves that have sprung never against the light nay then sleep if thou wilt love is content what should he do to weep sweet was love to thee once now in thine eyes sweeter than love is sleep
`` love seeketh not itself to please nor for itself hath any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven in hell 's despair '' so sung a little clod of clay trodden with the cattle 's feet but a pebble of the brook warbled out these metres meet '' love seeketh only self to please to bind another to its delight joys in another 's loss of ease and builds a hell in heaven 's despite ''

double sestina decameron x 7 there is no woman living that draws breath so sad as i though all things sadden her there is not one upon life 's weariest way who is weary as i am weary of all but death toward whom i look as looks the sunflower all day with all his whole soul toward the sun while in the sun 's sight i make moan all day and all night on my sleepless maiden bed weep and call out on death o love and thee that thou or he would take me to the dead and know not what thing evil i have done that life should lay such heavy hand on me alas love what is this thou wouldst with me what honour shalt thou have to quench my breath or what shall my heart broken profit thee o love o great god love what have i done that thou shouldst hunger so after my death my heart is harmless as my life 's first day seek out some false fair woman and plague her till her tears even as my tears fill her bed i am the least flower in thy flowery way but till my time be come that i be dead let me live out my flower-time in the sun though my leaves shut before the sunflower o love love love the kingly sunflower shall he the sun hath looked on look on me that live down here in shade out of the sun here living in the sorrow and shadow of death shall he that feeds his heart full of the day care to give mine eyes light or my lips breath because she loves him shall my lord love her who is as a worm in my lord 's kingly way i shall not see him or know him alive or dead but thou i know thee o love and pray to thee that in brief while my brief life-days be done and the worm quickly make my marriage-bed for underground there is no sleepless bed but here since i beheld my sunflower these eyes have slept not seeing all night and day his sunlike eyes and face fronting the sun wherefore if anywhere be any death i would fain find and fold him fast to me that i may sleep with the world 's eldest dead with her that died seven centuries since and her that went last night down the night-wandering way for this is sleep indeed when labour is done without love without dreams and without breath and without thought o name unnamed of thee ah but forgetting all things shall i thee wilt thou not be as now about my bed there underground as here before the sun shall not thy vision vex me alive and dead thy moving vision without form or breath i read long since the bitter tale of her who read the tale of launcelot on a day and died and had no quiet after death but was moved ever along a weary way lost with her love in the underworld ah me o my king o my lordly sunflower would god to me too such a thing were done but if such sweet and bitter things be done then flying from life i shall not fly from thee for in that living world without a sun thy vision will lay hold upon me dead and meet and mock me and mar my peace in death yet if being wroth god had such pity on her who was a sinner and foolish in her day that even in hell they twain should breathe one breath why should he not in some wise pity me so if i sleep not in my soft strait bed i may look up and see my sunflower as he the sun in some divine strange way o poor my heart well knowest thou in what way this sore sweet evil unto us was done for on a holy and a heavy day i was arisen out of my still small bed to see the knights tilt and one said to me '' the king '' and seeing him somewhat stopped my breath and if the girl spake more i heard not her for only i saw what i shall see when dead a kingly flower of knights a sunflower that shone against the sunlight like the sun and like a fire o heart consuming thee the fire of love that lights the pyre of death howbeit i shall not die an evil death who have loved in such a sad and sinless way that this my love lord was no shame to thee so when mine eyes are shut against the sun o my soul 's sun o the world 's sunflower thou nor no man will quite despise me dead and dying i pray with all my low last breath that thy whole life may be as was that day that feast-day that made trothplight death and me giving the world light of thy great deeds done and that fair face brightening thy bridal bed that god be good as god hath been to her that all things goodly and glad remain with her all things that make glad life and goodly death that as a bee sucks from a sunflower honey when summer draws delighted breath her soul may drink of thy soul in like way and love make life a fruitful marriage-bed where day may bring forth fruits of joy to day and night to night till days and nights be dead and as she gives light of her love to thee give thou to her the old glory of days long done and either give some heat of light to me to warm me where i sleep without the sun o sunflower made drunken with the sun o knight whose lady 's heart draws thine to her great king glad lover i have a word to thee there is a weed lives out of the sun 's way hid from the heat deep in the meadow 's bed that swoons and whitens at the wind 's least breath a flower star-shaped that all a summer day will gaze her soul out on the sunflower for very love till twilight finds her dead but the great sunflower heeds not her poor death knows not when all her loving life is done and so much knows my lord the king of me aye all day long he has no eye for me with golden eye following the golden sun from rose-coloured to purple-pillowed bed from birthplace to the flame-lit place of death from eastern end to western of his way so mine eye follows thee my sunflower so the white star-flower turns and yearns to thee the sick weak weed not well alive or dead trod underfoot if any pass by her pale without colour of summer or summer breath in the shrunk shuddering petals that have done no work but love and die before the day but thou to-day to-morrow and every day be glad and great o love whose love slays me thy fervent flower made fruitful from the sun shall drop its golden seed in the world 's way that all men thereof nourished shall praise thee for grain and flower and fruit of works well done till thy shed seed o shining sunflower bring forth such growth of the world 's garden-bed as like the sun shall outlive age and death and yet i would thine heart had heed of her who loves thee alive but not till she be dead come love then quickly and take her utmost breath song speak for me who am dumb as are the dead from my sad bed of tears i send forth thee to fly all day from sun 's birth to sun 's death down the sun 's way after the flying sun for love of her that gave thee wings and breath ere day be done to seek the sunflower
what is he buzzing in my ears `` now that i come to die do i view the world as a vale of tears '' ah reverend sir not i what i viewed there once what i view again where the physic bottles stand on the table 's edge —is a suburb lane with a wall to my bedside hand that lane sloped much as the bottles do from a house you could descry o'er the garden-wall is the curtain blue or green to a healthy eye to mine it serves for the old june weather blue above lane and wall and that farthest bottle labelled `` ether '' is the house o'ertopping all at a terrace somewhere near the stopper there watched for me one june a girl i know sir it 's improper my poor mind 's out of tune only there was a way ... you crept close by the side to dodge eyes in the house two eyes except they styled their house `` the lodge '' what right had a lounger up their lane but by creeping very close with the good wall 's help —their eyes might strain and stretch themselves to oes yet never catch her and me together as she left the attic there by the rim of the bottle labelled `` ether '' and stole from stair to stair and stood by the rose-wreathed gate alas we loved sir—used to meet how sad and bad and mad it was— but then how it was sweet
i ’ ve been here before dreaming myself backwards among grappling hooks of light true to the seasons i ’ ve lived every word spoken did i walk into someone ’ s nightmare hunger quivers on a fleshly string at the crossroad so deep is the lore there ’ s only tomorrow today where darkness splinters wounds the bird of paradise on paths that plunge into primordial green echo ’ s laughter finds us together in the sweatshops of desire men think if they don ’ t die the moon won ’ t rise all the dead-end streets run into one moment of bliss sleight of hand beside the euphrates past the tigris up the mississippi bloodline clockwork the x drawn where we stand trains follow rivers that curve around us the distant night opens like a pearl fan a skirt a heart a drop of salt when we embrace we are not an island beyond fables the blue exhaust of commerce when the sounds of river styx punish trees my effigy speaks to the night owl our voices break open the pink magnolia where struggle is home to the beast in us all the senses tuned for the hawkesbury labyrinths turning into lowland fog hand in hand feeling good we walk phantoms from the floating machine when a drowning man calls out his voice follows him downstream
it is half past ten in stonington the trees droop apprehensive of the heat and the sky has turned that pale suspicious colour that means that it can not support more light here on the terrace i and a companion each pretends to read the papers say that it is 90 in new york today across the street work is going forward on the abominable house that once i fancied half might be mine and which was in fact the home of the anonymous couple i used to hear at night arguing in their unhappy bedroom now they are throwing out another wing and the site of overlooked love is changed beyond recognition what will the day what will the summer bring psychic storms or calm productive doldrums our neighbours are no saner than ourselves perhaps it is time to give the stones a ring or to complain of the view from the gallery tower falling like a shadow across the calm veranda rich with malice and the threat of accidental meeting this is not a house but a collection the largest in private hands of sacred objects a spiritual boutique where anyone even the wrecker who had come to spoil may find himself spending more than he expected on something he can not quite identify here the little horrors become the household gods for the work of love requires a rule of thumb not no laws in particular but its own whose pseudonym at least here and now is pleasure the morning wasted in work and misquotation a light but leisurely lunch then reading walking or just watching the sun all afternoon till hungry we draw to evening and ombre who are we to thank for all of this the greatest favours are conferred in absence sometimes as a syllable gives comfort dependent on the time and place and person when pleasure and reality occur is there room for extra contemplation or the lyrical promenade it is enough to know and this is surely recognition that the world is spherical and perfect now i wish to introduce the copper beech we saw on our walk english and native here as i am whose shade is not the green of contemplation but the imagination ’ s rich metallic colour wherein under libido we live
what is thy thought of me what is thy feeling lov'st thou the veil of sense or its revealing leav'st thou the maiden rose drooping and blushing or rend'st its bosom with kissing and crushing i would be beautiful that thou should'st woo me gentle delightsome but to draw thee to me yet should thy longing eye ever caress me and quickened fantasy only possess me thus thy heart 's highest need long would i cherish lest its more trivial wish pall and then perish would that love 's fond pursuit were crownèd never or that his virgin kiss lasted for ever
muses that sing love 's sensual empery and lovers kindling your enraged fires at cupid 's bonfires burning in the eye blown with the empty breath of vain desires you that prefer the painted cabinet before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye that all your joys in dying figures set and stain the living substance of your glory abjure those joys abhor their memory and let my love the honour 'd subject be of love and honour 's complete history your eyes were never yet let in to see the majesty and riches of the mind but dwell in darkness for your god is blind
in stetson and calico vest spandex and calvin jeans she was the best at the bar does gucci make range boots hers were snakeskin with heels like railroad spikes the rest you could guess eyes the blue of west texas yonder complexion like hot coffee with cream all night i gave her slack but kept my dally-knot tight hoping she ’ d like the stories i could tell—drunk indian twins fighting with icepicks in cheyenne carolina moonshine deer breaking open watermelons out of crazy hunger regular as breath she ’ d say “ damn ” or “ yes ” and stomp a heel through sawdust to the pine floor i nearly had the rest of my life planned out downing coors and forking out for god-knows-whose till a dude in a brooks brothers suit moved in flashing a wad of andrew jacksons like cold cash grew on trees and she said to me—she fairly spat it— “ get lost ” so i did prostrate all night in a roadside hay field watching the sky sleek as a coal-black stallion ’ s flank damn if every star wasn ’ t a spur burning its wheels into my foolish eyes
it seems i have always sat here watching men like you — who turn heads whose gaze is always either a kiss or a slap or the whiplash of pure disregard why fret all you ’ re doing is walking you ’ re this year ’ s it the one righteous integer of cool cruising down a great-lipped channel of hushed adoration women turned girls again brightening in spite of themselves that brave wilting smile — you don ’ t see it do you how she tells herself to move on blinks until she can
what large dark hands are those at the window lifted grasping the golden light which weaves its way through the creeper leaves to my heart 's delight ah only the leaves but in the west in the west i see a redness come over the evening 's burning breast — — 't is the wound of love goes home the woodbine creeps abroad calling low to her lover the sun-lit flirt who all the day has poised above her lips in play and stolen kisses shallow and gay of pollen now has gone away — she woos the moth with her sweet low word and when above her his broad wings hover then her bright breast she will uncover and yield her honey-drop to her lover into the yellow evening glow saunters a man from the farm below leans and looks in at the low-built shed where hangs the swallow 's marriage bed the bird lies warm against the wall she glances quick her startled eyes towards him then she turns away her small head making warm display of red upon the throat his terrors sway her out of the nest 's warm busy ball whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies in one blue stoop from out the sties into the evening 's empty hall oh water-hen beside the rushes hide your quaint unfading blushes still your quick tail and lie as dead till the distance folds over his ominous tread the rabbit presses back her ears turns back her liquid anguished eyes and crouches low then with wild spring spurts from the terror of his oncoming to be choked back the wire ring her frantic effort throttling piteous brown ball of quivering fears ah soon in his large hard hands she dies and swings all loose to the swing of his walk yet calm and kindly are his eyes and ready to open in brown surprise should i not answer to his talk or should he my tears surmise i hear his hand on the latch and rise from my chair watching the door open he flashes bare his strong teeth in a smile and flashes his eyes in a smile like triumph upon me then careless-wise he flings the rabbit soft on the table board and comes towards me ah the uplifted sword of his hand against my bosom and oh the broad blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud his coming he raises up my face to him and caresses my mouth with his fingers which still smell grim of the rabbit 's fur god i am caught in a snare i know not what fine wire is round my throat i only know i let him finger there my pulse of life letting him nose like a stoat who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood and down his mouth comes to my mouth and down his dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood upon my mind his mouth meets mine and a flood of sweet fire sweeps across me so i drown within him die and find death good
what was the future then but affirmation the first yes between us followed by the first lingering dawn waking below a window shaded by redwoods waking we hadn ’ t slept— we found time saved like sunlight in a tree still the house was cold and there were shadows the couple in the next room rapped the wall to quiet us like them condescending from a bitter knowledge that young as we all were love didn ’ t last but receded into silence wedging our pillows back of the headboard that clapped in time with us we let them think we agreed then holding on we closed each other ’ s mouths and felt that slowness that the best days begin with turn into the speed with which they fly flight was that year ’ s theme all around us— flight of hunter and hunted the president turning inward on one wing and on the patio the emigration of termites a glittering fleet leaving that shadowed house a little lighter within it all above it or beyond we thought we were the fixed point and held still as the quail lit down beside us and waited for her plump mate to appear his crest a quivering hook the valley ’ s reach of sunshine reeled them in there was wilderness around us don ’ t forget behind the nets of fragrance thrown across our path by the acacia lurked the green man or the kidnapper and there was the pacific with its own passions taking place as rain the sorrow of the couple in the next room was a deep muteness nightly that loneliness could come of loving was like news of time cored out of the redwood the house that we made shake or thought we did was taking wing already after we left still it took us years before we stopped comparing every morning together to that first one and every place we lived to that first place and everything we said to that first word repeated all night long
oh why is heaven built so far oh why is earth set so remote i can not reach the nearest star that hangs afloat i would not care to reach the moon one round monotonous of change yet even she repeats her tune beyond my range i never watch the scatter 'd fire of stars or sun 's far-trailing train but all my heart is one desire and all in vain for i am bound with fleshly bands joy beauty lie beyond my scope i strain my heart i stretch my hands and catch at hope

when the last fight is lost the last sword broken the last call sounded the last order spoken when from the field where braver hearts lie sleeping faint and athirst and blinded i come creeping with not one waving shred of palm to bring you with not one splendid battle-song to sing you o love in my dishonor and defeat your measureless compassion will be sweet
my love is of a birth as rare as ’ tis for object strange and high it was begotten by despair upon impossibility magnanimous despair alone could show me so divine a thing where feeble hope could ne ’ er have flown but vainly flapp ’ d its tinsel wing and yet i quickly might arrive where my extended soul is fixt but fate does iron wedges drive and always crowds itself betwixt for fate with jealous eye does see two perfect loves nor lets them close their union would her ruin be and her tyrannic pow ’ r depose and therefore her decrees of steel us as the distant poles have plac ’ d though love ’ s whole world on us doth wheel not by themselves to be embrac ’ d unless the giddy heaven fall and earth some new convulsion tear and us to join the world should all be cramp ’ d into a planisphere as lines so loves oblique may well themselves in every angle greet but ours so truly parallel though infinite can never meet therefore the love which us doth bind but fate so enviously debars is the conjunction of the mind and opposition of the stars
a sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness a lawn about the shoulders thrown into a fine distraction an erring lace which here and there enthrals the crimson stomacher a cuff neglectful and thereby ribands to flow confusedly a winning wave deserving note in the tempestuous petticoat a careless shoe-string in whose tie i see a wild civility do more bewitch me than when art is too precise in every part

cold eyelids that hide like a jewel hard eyes that grow soft for an hour the heavy white limbs and the cruel red mouth like a venomous flower when these are gone by with their glories what shall rest of thee then what remain o mystic and sombre dolores our lady of pain seven sorrows the priests give their virgin but thy sins which are seventy times seven seven ages would fail thee to purge in and then they would haunt thee in heaven fierce midnights and famishing morrows and the loves that complete and control all the joys of the flesh all the sorrows that wear out the soul o garment not golden but gilded o garden where all men may dwell o tower not of ivory but builded by hands that reach heaven from hell o mystical rose of the mire o house not of gold but of gain o house of unquenchable fire our lady of pain o lips full of lust and of laughter curled snakes that are fed from my breast bite hard lest remembrance come after and press with new lips where you pressed for my heart too springs up at the pressure mine eyelids too moisten and burn ah feed me and fill me with pleasure ere pain come in turn in yesterday 's reach and to-morrow 's out of sight though they lie of to-day there have been and there yet shall be sorrows that smite not and bite not in play the life and the love thou despisest these hurt us indeed and in vain o wise among women and wisest our lady of pain who gave thee thy wisdom what stories that stung thee what visions that smote wert thou pure and a maiden dolores when desire took thee first by the throat what bud was the shell of a blossom that all men may smell to and pluck what milk fed thee first at what bosom what sins gave thee suck we shift and bedeck and bedrape us thou art noble and nude and antique libitina thy mother priapus thy father a tuscan and greek we play with light loves in the portal and wince and relent and refrain loves die and we know thee immortal our lady of pain fruits fail and love dies and time ranges thou art fed with perpetual breath and alive after infinite changes and fresh from the kisses of death of languors rekindled and rallied of barren delights and unclean things monstrous and fruitless a pallid and poisonous queen could you hurt me sweet lips though i hurt you men touch them and change in a trice the lilies and languors of virtue for the raptures and roses of vice those lie where thy foot on the floor is these crown and caress thee and chain o splendid and sterile dolores our lady of pain there are sins it may be to discover there are deeds it may be to delight what new work wilt thou find for thy lover what new passions for daytime or night what spells that they know not a word of whose lives are as leaves overblown what tortures undreamt of unheard of unwritten unknown ah beautiful passionate body that never has ached with a heart on thy mouth though the kisses are bloody though they sting till it shudder and smart more kind than the love we adore is they hurt not the heart or the brain o bitter and tender dolores our lady of pain as our kisses relax and redouble from the lips and the foam and the fangs shall no new sin be born for men 's trouble no dream of impossible pangs with the sweet of the sins of old ages wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore too sweet is the rind say the sages too bitter the core hast thou told all thy secrets the last time and bared all thy beauties to one ah where shall we go then for pastime if the worst that can be has been done but sweet as the rind was the core is we are fain of thee still we are fain o sanguine and subtle dolores our lady of pain by the hunger of change and emotion by the thirst of unbearable things by despair the twin-born of devotion by the pleasure that winces and stings the delight that consumes the desire the desire that outruns the delight by the cruelty deaf as a fire and blind as the night by the ravenous teeth that have smitten through the kisses that blossom and bud by the lips intertwisted and bitten till the foam has a savour of blood by the pulse as it rises and falters by the hands as they slacken and strain i adjure thee respond from thine altars our lady of pain wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining the light fire in the veins of a boy but he comes to thee sad without feigning who has wearied of sorrow and joy less careful of labour and glory than the elders whose hair has uncurled and young but with fancies as hoary and grey as the world i have passed from the outermost portal to the shrine where a sin is a prayer what care though the service be mortal o our lady of torture what care all thine the last wine that i pour is the last in the chalice we drain o fierce and luxurious dolores our lady of pain all thine the new wine of desire the fruit of four lips as they clung till the hair and the eyelids took fire the foam of a serpentine tongue the froth of the serpents of pleasure more salt than the foam of the sea now felt as a flame now at leisure as wine shed for me ah thy people thy children thy chosen marked cross from the womb and perverse they have found out the secret to cozen the gods that constrain us and curse they alone they are wise and none other give me place even me in their train o my sister my spouse and my mother our lady of pain for the crown of our life as it closes is darkness the fruit thereof dust no thorns go as deep as a rose 's and love is more cruel than lust time turns the old days to derision our loves into corpses or wives and marriage and death and division make barren our lives and pale from the past we draw nigh thee and satiate with comfortless hours and we know thee how all men belie thee and we gather the fruit of thy flowers the passion that slays and recovers the pangs and the kisses that rain on the lips and the limbs of thy lovers our lady of pain the desire of thy furious embraces is more than the wisdom of years on the blossom though blood lie in traces though the foliage be sodden with tears for the lords in whose keeping the door is that opens on all who draw breath gave the cypress to love my dolores the myrtle to death and they laughed changing hands in the measure and they mixed and made peace after strife pain melted in tears and was pleasure death tingled with blood and was life like lovers they melted and tingled in the dusk of thine innermost fane in the darkness they murmured and mingled our lady of pain in a twilight where virtues are vices in thy chapels unknown of the sun to a tune that enthralls and entices they were wed and the twain were as one for the tune from thine altar hath sounded since god bade the world 's work begin and the fume of thine incense abounded to sweeten the sin love listens and paler than ashes through his curls as the crown on them slips lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes and laughs with insatiable lips thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses with music that scares the profane thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses our lady of pain thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive in his lips all thy serpents shall nestle in his hands all thy cruelties thrive in the daytime thy voice shall go through him in his dreams he shall feel thee and ache thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him asleep and awake thou shalt touch and make redder his roses with juice not of fruit nor of bud when the sense in the spirit reposes thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood thine thine the one grace we implore is who would live and not languish or feign o sleepless and deadly dolores our lady of pain dost thou dream in a respite of slumber in a lull of the fires of thy life of the days without name without number when thy will stung the world into strife when a goddess the pulse of thy passion smote kings as they revelled in rome and they hailed thee re-risen o thalassian foam-white from the foam when thy lips had such lovers to flatter when the city lay red from thy rods and thine hands were as arrows to scatter the children of change and their gods when the blood of thy foemen made fervent a sand never moist from the main as one smote them their lord and thy servant our lady of pain on sands by the storm never shaken nor wet from the washing of tides nor by foam of the waves overtaken nor winds that the thunder bestrides but red from the print of thy paces made smooth for the world and its lords ringed round with a flame of fair faces and splendid with swords there the gladiator pale for thy pleasure drew bitter and perilous breath there torments laid hold on the treasure of limbs too delicious for death when thy gardens were lit with live torches when the world was a steed for thy rein when the nations lay prone in thy porches our lady of pain when with flame all around him aspirant stood flushed as a harp-player stands the implacable beautiful tyrant rose-crowned having death in his hands and a sound as the sound of loud water smote far through the flight of the fires and mixed with the lightning of slaughter a thunder of lyres dost thou dream of what was and no more is the old kingdoms of earth and the kings dost thou hunger for these things dolores for these in a world of new things but thy bosom no fasts could emaciate no hunger compel to complain those lips that no bloodshed could satiate our lady of pain as of old when the world 's heart was lighter through thy garments the grace of thee glows the white wealth of thy body made whiter by the blushes of amorous blows and seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers and branded by kisses that bruise when all shall be gone that now lingers ah what shall we lose thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion and thy limbs are as melodies yet and move to the music of passion with lithe and lascivious regret what ailed us o gods to desert you for creeds that refuse and restrain come down and redeem us from virtue our lady of pain all shrines that were vestal are flameless but the flame has not fallen from this though obscure be the god and though nameless the eyes and the hair that we kiss low fires that love sits by and forges fresh heads for his arrows and thine hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies with kisses and wine thy skin changes country and colour and shrivels or swells to a snake 's let it brighten and bloat and grow duller we know it the flames and the flakes red brands on it smitten and bitten round skies where a star is a stain and the leaves with thy litanies written our lady of pain on thy bosom though many a kiss be there are none such as knew it of old was it alciphron once or arisbe male ringlets or feminine gold that thy lips met with under the statue whence a look shot out sharp after thieves from the eyes of the garden-god at you across the fig-leaves then still through dry seasons and moister one god had a wreath to his shrine then love was the pearl of his oyster and venus rose red out of wine we have all done amiss choosing rather such loves as the wise gods disdain intercede for us thou with thy father our lady of pain in spring he had crowns of his garden red corn in the heat of the year then hoary green olives that harden when the grape-blossom freezes with fear and milk-budded myrtles with venus and vine-leaves with bacchus he trod and ye said `` we have seen he hath seen us a visible god '' what broke off the garlands that girt you what sundered you spirit and clay weak sins yet alive are as virtue to the strength of the sins of that day for dried is the blood of thy lover ipsithilla contracted the vein cry aloud `` will he rise and recover our lady of pain '' cry aloud for the old world is broken cry out for the phrygian is priest and rears not the bountiful token and spreads not the fatherly feast from the midmost of ida from shady recesses that murmur at morn they have brought and baptized her our lady a goddess new-born and the chaplets of old are above us and the oyster-bed teems out of reach old poets outsing and outlove us and catullus makes mouths at our speech who shall kiss in thy father 's own city with such lips as he sang with again intercede for us all of thy pity our lady of pain out of dindymus heavily laden her lions draw bound and unfed a mother a mortal a maiden a queen over death and the dead she is cold and her habit is lowly her temple of branches and sods most fruitful and virginal holy a mother of gods she hath wasted with fire thine high places she hath hidden and marred and made sad the fair limbs of the loves the fair faces of gods that were goodly and glad she slays and her hands are not bloody she moves as a moon in the wane white-robed and thy raiment is ruddy our lady of pain they shall pass and their places be taken the gods and the priests that are pure they shall pass and shalt thou not be shaken they shall perish and shalt thou endure death laughs breathing close and relentless in the nostrils and eyelids of lust with a pinch in his fingers of scentless and delicate dust but the worm shall revive thee with kisses thou shalt change and transmute as a god as the rod to a serpent that hisses as the serpent again to a rod thy life shall not cease though thou doff it thou shalt live until evil be slain and good shall die first said thy prophet our lady of pain did he lie did he laugh does he know it now he lies out of reach out of breath thy prophet thy preacher thy poet sin 's child by incestuous death did he find out in fire at his waking or discern as his eyelids lost light when the bands of the body were breaking and all came in sight who has known all the evil before us or the tyrannous secrets of time though we match not the dead men that bore us at a song at a kiss at a crime — though the heathen outface and outlive us and our lives and our longings are twain — ah forgive us our virtues forgive us our lady of pain who are we that embalm and embrace thee with spices and savours of song what is time that his children should face thee what am i that my lips do thee wrong i could hurt thee — but pain would delight thee or caress thee — but love would repel and the lovers whose lips would excite thee are serpents in hell who now shall content thee as they did thy lovers when temples were built and the hair of the sacrifice braided and the blood of the sacrifice spilt in lampsacus fervent with faces in aphaca red from thy reign who embraced thee with awful embraces our lady of pain where are they cotytto or venus astarte or ashtaroth where do their hands as we touch come between us is the breath of them hot in thy hair from their lips have thy lips taken fever with the blood of their bodies grown red hast thou left upon earth a believer if these men are dead they were purple of raiment and golden filled full of thee fiery with wine thy lovers in haunts unbeholden in marvellous chambers of thine they are fled and their footprints escape us who appraise thee adore and abstain o daughter of death and priapus our lady of pain what ails us to fear overmeasure to praise thee with timorous breath o mistress and mother of pleasure the one thing as certain as death we shall change as the things that we cherish shall fade as they faded before as foam upon water shall perish as sand upon shore we shall know what the darkness discovers if the grave-pit be shallow or deep and our fathers of old and our lovers we shall know if they sleep not or sleep we shall see whether hell be not heaven find out whether tares be not grain and the joys of thee seventy times seven our lady of pain
i when bishop berkeley said `` there was no matter '' and proved it—'twas no matter what he said they say his system 't is in vain to batter too subtle for the airiest human head and yet who can believe it i would shatter gladly all matters down to stone or lead or adamant to find the world a spirit and wear my head denying that i wear it ii what a sublime discovery 't was to make the universe universal egotism that all 's ideal—all ourselves i 'll stake the world be it what you will that that 's no schism oh doubt —if thou be'st doubt for which some take thee but which i doubt extremely—thou sole prism of the truth 's rays spoil not my draught of spirit heaven 's brandy though our brain can hardly bear it iii for ever and anon comes indigestion not the most `` dainty ariel '' and perplexes our soarings with another sort of question and that which after all my spirit vexes is that i find no spot where man can rest eye on without confusion of the sorts and sexes of beings stars and this unriddled wonder the world which at the worst 's a glorious blunder— iv if it be chance—or if it be according to the old text still better lest it should turn out so we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording as several people think such hazards rude they 're right our days are too brief for affording space to dispute what no one ever could decide and everybody one day will know very clearly—or at least lie still v and therefore will i leave off metaphysical discussion which is neither here nor there if i agree that what is is then this i call being quite perspicuous and extremely fair the truth is i 've grown lately rather phthisical i do n't know what the reason is—the air perhaps but as i suffer from the shocks of illness i grow much more orthodox vi the first attack at once prov 'd the divinity but that i never doubted nor the devil the next the virgin 's mystical virginity the third the usual origin of evil the fourth at once establish 'd the whole trinity on so uncontrovertible a level that i devoutly wish 'd the three were four— on purpose to believe so much the more vii to our theme.—the man who has stood on the acropolis and look 'd down over attica or he who has sail 'd where picturesque constantinople is or seen timbuctoo or hath taken tea in small-ey 'd china 's crockery-ware metropolis or sat amidst the bricks of nineveh may not think much of london 's first appearance— but ask him what he thinks of it a year hence viii don juan had got out on shooter 's hill sunset the time the place the same declivity which looks along that vale of good and ill where london streets ferment in full activity while everything around was calm and still except the creak of wheels which on their pivot he heard and that bee-like bubbling busy hum of cities that boil over with their scum— ix i say don juan wrapp 'd in contemplation walk 'd on behind his carriage o'er the summit and lost in wonder of so great a nation gave way to't since he could not overcome it `` and here '' he cried `` is freedom 's chosen station here peals the people 's voice nor can entomb it racks prisons inquisitions resurrection awaits it each new meeting or election x '' here are chaste wives pure lives her people pay but what they please and if that things be dear 'tis only that they love to throw away their cash to show how much they have a-year here laws are all inviolate none lay traps for the traveller every highway 's clear here '' —he was interrupted by a knife with— '' damn your eyes your money or your life '' xi these free-born sounds proceeded from four pads in ambush laid who had perceiv 'd him loiter behind his carriage and like handy lads had seiz 'd the lucky hour to reconnoitre in which the heedless gentleman who gads upon the road unless he prove a fighter may find himself within that isle of riches expos 'd to lose his life as well as breeches xii juan who did not understand a word of english save their shibboleth `` god damn '' and even that he had so rarely heard he sometimes thought 't was only their salam '' or `` god be with you `` —and 't is not absurd to think so for half english as i am to my misfortune never can i say i heard them wish `` god with you '' save that way— xiii juan yet quickly understood their gesture and being somewhat choleric and sudden drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture and fired it into one assailant 's pudding who fell as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture and roar 'd out as he writh 'd his native mud in unto his nearest follower or henchman '' oh jack i 'm floor 'd by that ere bloody frenchman '' xiv on which jack and his train set off at speed and juan 's suite late scatter 'd at a distance came up all marvelling at such a deed and offering as usual late assistance juan who saw the moon 's late minion bleed as if his veins would pour out his existence stood calling out for bandages and lint and wish 'd he had been less hasty with his flint xv '' perhaps '' thought he '' it is the country 's wont to welcome foreigners in this way now i recollect some innkeepers who don't differ except in robbing with a bow in lieu of a bare blade and brazen front but what is to be done i ca n't allow the fellow to lie groaning on the road so take him up i 'll help you with the load '' xvi but ere they could perform this pious duty the dying man cried `` hold i 've got my gruel oh for a glass of max we 've miss 'd our booty— let me die where i am '' and as the fuel of life shrunk in his heart and thick and sooty the drops fell from his death-wound and he drew ill his breath he from his swelling throat untied a kerchief crying `` give sal that `` —and died xvii the cravat stain 'd with bloody drops fell down before don juan 's feet he could not tell exactly why it was before him thrown nor what the meaning of the man 's farewell poor tom was once a kiddy upon town a thorough varmint and a real swell full flash all fancy until fairly diddled his pockets first and then his body riddled xviii don juan having done the best he could in all the circumstances of the case as soon as `` crowner 's 'quest '' allow 'd pursu'd his travels to the capital apace esteeming it a little hard he should in twelve hours time and very little space have been oblig 'd to slay a free-born native in self-defence this made him meditative xix he from the world had cut off a great man who in his time had made heroic bustle who in a row like tom could lead the van booze in the ken or at the spellken hustle who queer a flat who spite of bowstreet 's ban on the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle who on a lark with black-eyed sal his blowing so prime so swell so nutty and so knowing xx but tom 's no more—and so no more of tom heroes must die and by god 's blessing 't is not long before the most of them go home hail thamis hail upon thy verge it is that juan 's chariot rolling like a drum in thunder holds the way it ca n't well miss through kennington and all the other `` tons '' which make us wish ourselves in town at once xxi through groves so called as being void of trees like lucus from no light through prospects nam'd mount pleasant as containing nought to please nor much to climb through little boxes fram'd of bricks to let the dust in at your ease with `` to be let '' upon their doors proclaim 'd through `` rows '' most modestly call 'd `` paradise '' which eve might quit without much sacrifice xxii through coaches drays chok 'd turnpikes and a whirl of wheels and roar of voices and confusion here taverns wooing to a pint of `` purl '' there mails fast flying off like a delusion there barbers blocks with periwigs in curl in windows here the lamplighter 's infusion slowly distill 'd into the glimmering glass for in those days we had not got to gas xxiii through this and much and more is the approach of travellers to mighty babylon whether they come by horse or chaise or coach with slight exceptions all the ways seem one i could say more but do not choose to encroach upon the guide-book 's privilege the sun had set some time and night was on the ridge of twilight as the party cross 'd the bridge xxiv that 's rather fine the gentle sound of thamis— who vindicates a moment too his stream— though hardly heard through multifarious `` damme 's '' the lamps of westminster 's more regular gleam the breadth of pavement and yon shrine where fame is a spectral resident—whose pallid beam in shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile— make this a sacred part of albion 's isle xxv the druid 's groves are gone—so much the better stonehenge is not—but what the devil is it — but bedlam still exists with its sage fetter that madmen may not bite you on a visit the bench too seats or suits full many a debtor the mansion house too though some people quiz it to me appears a stiff yet grand erection but then the abbey 's worth the whole collection xxvi the line of lights too up to charing cross pall mall and so forth have a coruscation like gold as in comparison to dross match 'd with the continent 's illumination whose cities night by no means deigns to gloss the french were not yet a lamp-lighting nation and when they grew so—on their new-found lantern instead of wicks they made a wicked man turn xxvii a row of gentlemen along the streets suspended may illuminate mankind as also bonfires made of country seats but the old way is best for the purblind the other looks like phosphorus on sheets a sort of ignis fatuus to the mind which though 't is certain to perplex and frighten must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten xxviii but london 's so well lit that if diogenes could recommence to hunt his honest man and found him not amidst the various progenies of this enormous city 's spreading spawn 'twere not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his yet undiscover 'd treasure what i can i 've done to find the same throughout life 's journey but see the world is only one attorney xxix over the stones still rattling up pall mall through crowds and carriages but waxing thinner as thunder 'd knockers broke the long seal 'd spell of doors 'gainst duns and to an early dinner admitted a small party as night fell don juan our young

when awful darkness and silence reign over the great gromboolian plain through the long long wintry nights — when the angry breakers roar as they beat on the rocky shore — when storm-clouds brood on the towering heights of the hills of the chankly bore — then through the vast and gloomy dark there moves what seems a fiery spark a lonely spark with silvery rays piercing the coal-black night — a meteor strange and bright — hither and thither the vision strays a single lurid light slowly it wander — pauses — creeps — anon it sparkles — flashes and leaps and ever as onward it gleaming goes a light on the bong-tree stems it throws and those who watch at that midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as the wild light passes along — '' the dong — the dong `` the wandering dong through the forest goes `` the dong the dong `` the dong with a luminous nose '' long years ago the dong was happy and gay till he fell in love with a jumbly girl who came to those shores one day for the jumblies came in a sieve they did — landing at eve near the zemmery fidd where the oblong oysters grow and the rocks are smooth and gray and all the woods and the valleys rang with the chorus they daily and nightly sang — '' far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve happily happily passed those days while the cheerful jumblies staid they danced in circlets all night long to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong in moonlight shine or shade for day and night he was always there by the side of the jumbly girl so fair with her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair till the morning came of that hateful day when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away and the dong was left on the cruel shore gazing — gazing for evermore — ever keeping his weary eyes on that pea-green sail on the far horizon — singing the jumbly chorus still as he sate all day on the grassy hill — '' far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve but when the sun was low in the west the dong arose and said — `` what little sense i once possessed has quite gone out of my head '' — and since that day he wanders still by lake and dorest marsh and hills singing — `` o somewhere in valley or plain '' might i find my jumbly girl again `` for ever i 'll seek by lake and shore '' till i find my jumbly girl once more '' playing a pipe with silvery squeaks since then his jumbly girl he seeks and because by night he could not see he gathered the bark of the twangum tree on the flowery plain that grows and he wove him a wondrous nose — a nose as strange as a nose could be of vast proportions and painted red and tied with cords to the back of his head — in a hollow rounded space it ended with a luminous lamp within suspended all fenced about with a bandage stout to prevent the wind from blowing it out — and with holes all round to send the light in gleaming rays on the dismal night and now each night and all night long over those plains still roams the dong and above the wail of the chimp and snipe you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe while ever he seeks but seeks in vain to meet with his jumbly girl again lonely and wild — all night he goes — the dong with a luminous nose and all who watch at the midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as they trace the meteor bright moving along through the dreary night — '' this is the hour when forth he goes '' the dong with a luminous nose `` yonder — over the plain he goes '' he goes `` he goes '' the dong with a luminous nose ''

here take my picture though i bid farewell thine in my heart where my soul dwells shall dwell 't is like me now but i dead 'twill be more when we are shadows both than 't was before when weather-beaten i come back my hand perhaps with rude oars torn or sun beams tann 'd my face and breast of haircloth and my head with care 's rash sudden storms being o'erspread my body'a sack of bones broken within and powder 's blue stains scatter 'd on my skin if rival fools tax thee to'have lov 'd a man so foul and coarse as oh i may seem then this shall say what i was and thou shalt say '' do his hurts reach me doth my worth decay or do they reach his judging mind that he should now love less what he did love to see that which in him was fair and delicate was but the milk which in love 's childish state did nurse it who now is grown strong enough to feed on that which to disus 'd tastes seems tough ''
`` who is it that this dark night underneath my window plaineth '' it is one who from thy sight being ah exil 'd disdaineth every other vulgar light `` why alas and are you he be not yet those fancies changed '' dear when you find change in me though from me you be estranged let my change to ruin be `` well in absence this will die leave to see and leave to wonder '' absence sure will help if i can learn how myself to sunder from what in my heart doth lie `` but time will these thoughts remove time doth work what no man knoweth '' time doth as the subject prove with time still the affection groweth in the faithful turtle-dove `` what if you new beauties see will not they stir new affection '' i will think they pictures be image-like of saints perfection poorly counterfeiting thee `` but your reason 's purest light bids you leave such minds to nourish '' dear do reason no such spite never doth thy beauty flourish more than in my reason 's sight `` but the wrongs love bears will make love at length leave undertaking '' no the more fools it do shake in a ground of so firm making deeper still they drive the stake `` peace i think that some give ear come no more lest i get anger '' bliss i will my bliss forbear fearing sweet you to endanger but my soul shall harbour there `` well begone begone i say lest that argus eyes perceive you '' oh unjust fortune 's sway which can make me thus to leave you and from louts to run away
in these deep solitudes and awful cells where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells and ever-musing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestal 's veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat yet yet i love —from abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name dear fatal name rest ever unreveal 'd nor pass these lips in holy silence seal 'd hide it my heart within that close disguise where mix 'd with god 's his lov 'd idea lies o write it not my hand—the name appears already written—wash it out my tears in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays her heart still dictates and her hand obeys relentless walls whose darksome round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn ye grots and caverns shagg 'd with horrid thorn shrines where their vigils pale-ey 'd virgins keep and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep though cold like you unmov 'd and silent grown i have not yet forgot myself to stone all is not heav'n 's while abelard has part still rebel nature holds out half my heart nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain soon as thy letters trembling i unclose that well-known name awakens all my woes oh name for ever sad for ever dear still breath 'd in sighs still usher 'd with a tear i tremble too where'er my own i find some dire misfortune follows close behind line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow led through a sad variety of woe now warm in love now with'ring in thy bloom lost in a convent 's solitary gloom there stern religion quench 'd th unwilling flame there died the best of passions love and fame yet write oh write me all that i may join griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away and is my abelard less kind than they tears still are mine and those i need not spare love but demands what else were shed in pray'r no happier task these faded eyes pursue to read and weep is all they now can do then share thy pain allow that sad relief ah more than share it give me all thy grief heav'n first taught letters for some wretch 's aid some banish 'd lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to its fires the virgin 's wish without her fears impart excuse the blush and pour out all the heart speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul and waft a sigh from indus to the pole thou know'st how guiltless first i met thy flame when love approach 'd me under friendship 's name my fancy form 'd thee of angelic kind some emanation of th all-beauteous mind those smiling eyes attemp'ring ev'ry day shone sweetly lambent with celestial day guiltless i gaz 'd heav'n listen 'd while you sung and truths divine came mended from that tongue from lips like those what precept fail 'd to move too soon they taught me 't was no sin to love back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran nor wish 'd an angel whom i lov 'd a man dim and remote the joys of saints i see nor envy them that heav'n i lose for thee how oft when press 'd to marriage have i said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame before true passion all those views remove fame wealth and honour what are you to love the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and bids them make mistaken mortals groan who seek in love for aught but love alone should at my feet the world 's great master fall himself his throne his world i 'd scorn 'em all not caesar 's empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love if there be yet another name more free more fond than mistress make me that to thee oh happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature law all then is full possessing and possess 'd no craving void left aching in the breast ev'n thought meets thought ere from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be and once the lot of abelard and me alas how chang 'd what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had oppos 'd the dire command barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain the crime was common common be the pain i can no more by shame by rage suppress 'd let tears and burning blushes speak the rest canst thou forget that sad that solemn day when victims at yon altar 's foot we lay canst thou forget what tears that moment fell when warm in youth i bade the world farewell as with cold lips i kiss 'd the sacred veil the shrines all trembl 'd and the lamps grew pale heav'n scarce believ 'd the conquest it survey 'd and saints with wonder heard the vows i made yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fix 'd but you not grace or zeal love only was my call and if i lose thy love i lose my all come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe those still at least are left thee to bestow still on that breast enamour 'd let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be press 'd give all thou canst—and let me dream the rest ah no instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care plants of thy hand and children of thy pray'r from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you rais 'd these hallow 'd walls the desert smil 'd and paradise was open 'd in the wild no weeping orphan saw his father 's stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors no silver saints by dying misers giv'n here brib 'd the rage of ill-requited heav'n but such plain roofs as piety could raise and only vocal with the maker 's praise in these lone walls their days eternal bound these moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown 'd where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffus 'd a reconciling ray and gleams of glory brighten 'd all the day but now no face divine contentment wears 'tis all blank sadness or continual tears see how the force of others pray'rs i try o pious fraud of am'rous charity but why should i on others pray'rs depend come thou my father brother husband friend ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move and all those tender names in one thy love the darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wand'ring streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinkling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid but o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves long-sounding aisles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a death-like silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades ev'ry flow'r and darkens ev'ry green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods yet here for ever ever must i stay sad proof how well a lover can obey death only death can break the lasting chain and here ev'n then shall my cold dust remain here all its frailties all its flames resign and wait till 't is no sin to mix with thine ah wretch believ 'd the spouse of god in vain confess 'd within the slave of love and man assist me heav'n but whence arose that pray'r sprung it from piety or from despair ev'n here where frozen chastity retires love finds an altar for forbidden fires i ought to grieve but can not what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault i view my crime but kindle at the view repent old pleasures and solicit new now turn 'd to heav'n i weep my past offence now think of thee and curse my innocence of all affliction taught a lover yet 'tis sure the hardest science to forget how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense and love th offender yet detest th offence how the dear object from the crime remove or how distinguish penitence from love unequal task a passion to resign for hearts so touch 'd so pierc 'd so lost as mine ere such a soul regains its peaceful state how often must it love how often hate how often hope despair resent regret conceal disdain—do all things but forget but let heav'n seize it all at once 't is fir 'd not touch 'd but rapt not waken 'd but inspir 'd oh come oh teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life myself—and you fill my fond heart with god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee how happy is the blameless vestal 's lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each pray'r accepted and each wish resign 'd labour and rest that equal periods keep '' obedient slumbers that can wake and weep '' desires compos 'd affections ever ev'n tears that delight and sighs that waft to heav'n grace shines around her with serenest beams and whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams for her th unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymeneals sing to sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy when at the close of each sad sorrowing day fancy restores what vengeance snatch 'd away then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee oh curs 'd dear horrors of all-conscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight provoking daemons all restraint remove and stir within me every source of love i hear thee view thee gaze o'er all thy charms and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms i wake—no more i hear no more i view the phantom flies me as unkind as you i call aloud it hears not what i say i stretch my empty arms it glides away to dream once more i close my willing eyes ye soft illusions dear deceits arise alas no more—methinks we wand'ring go through dreary wastes and weep each other 's woe where round some mould'ring tower pale ivy creeps and low-brow 'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps sudden you mount you beckon from the skies clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise i shriek start up the same sad prospect find and wake to all the griefs i left behind for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain thy life a long dead calm of fix 'd repose no pulse that riots and no blood that glows still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow or moving spirit bade the waters flow soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n and mild as opening gleams of promis 'd heav'n come abelard for what hast thou to dread the torch of venus burns not for the dead nature stands check 'd religion disapproves ev'n thou art cold—yet eloisa loves ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn to light the dead and warm th unfruitful urn what scenes appear where'er i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee thy image steals between my god and me thy voice i seem in ev'ry hymn to hear with ev'ry bead i drop too soft a tear when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priests tapers temples swim before my sight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drown 'd while altars blaze and angels tremble round while prostrate here in humble grief i lie kind virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye while praying trembling in the dust i roll and dawning grace is op'ning on my soul come if thou dar'st all charming as thou art oppose thyself to heav'n dispute my heart come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace those sorrows and those tears take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs snatch me just mounting from the blest abode assist the fiends and tear me from my god no fly me fly me far as pole from pole rise alps between us and whole oceans roll ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whate'er was mine fair eyes and tempting looks which yet i view long lov 'd ador 'd ideas all adieu oh grace serene oh virtue heav'nly fair divine oblivion of low-thoughted care fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky and faith our early immortality enter each mild each amicable guest receive and wrap me in eternal rest see in her cell sad eloisa spread propp 'd on some tomb a neighbour of the dead in each low wind methinks a spirit calls and more than echoes talk along the walls here as i watch 'd the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound `` come sister come '' it said or seem 'd to say '' thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and pray 'd love 's victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear for god not man absolves our frailties here '' i come i come prepare your roseate bow'rs celestial palms and ever-blooming flow'rs thither where sinners may have rest i go where flames refin 'd in breasts seraphic glow thou abelard the last sad office pay and smooth my passage to the realms of day see my lips tremble and my eye-balls roll suck my last breath and catch my flying soul ah no—in sacred vestments may'st thou stand the hallow 'd taper trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die ah then thy once-lov 'd eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me see from my cheek the transient roses fly see the last sparkle languish in my eye till ev'ry motion pulse and breath be o'er and ev'n my abelard be lov 'd no more o death all-eloquent you only prove what dust we dote on when 't is man we love then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy that cause of all my guilt and all my joy in trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown 'd bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round from op'ning skies may streaming glories shine and saints embrace thee with a love like mine may one kind grave unite each hapless name and graft my love immortal on thy fame then ages hence when all my woes are o'er when this rebellious heart shall beat no more if ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings to paraclete 's white walls and silver springs o'er the pale marble shall they join their heads and drink the falling tears each other sheds then sadly say with mutual pity mov 'd '' oh may we never love as these have lov 'd '' from the full choir when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice amid that scene if some relenting eye glance on the stone where our cold relics lie devotion 's self shall steal a thought from heav'n one human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n and sure if fate some future bard shall join in sad similitude of griefs to mine condemn 'd whole years in absence to deplore and image charms he must behold no more such if there be who loves so long so well let him our sad our tender story tell the well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost he best can paint 'em who shall feel 'em most
in love it may be dangerous to reckon on time to count on it time ’ s here and then it ’ s gone i ’ m not thinking of death or disaster but of the slippage the unpredictable disappearance of days on which we were depending for happiness
a poetic romance excerpt book i a thing of beauty is a joy for ever its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness but still will keep a bower quiet for us and a sleep full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing therefore on every morrow are we wreathing a flowery band to bind us to the earth spite of despondence of the inhuman dearth of noble natures of the gloomy days of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways made for our searching yes in spite of all some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits such the sun the moon trees old and young sprouting a shady boon for simple sheep and such are daffodils with the green world they live in and clear rills that for themselves a cooling covert make 'gainst the hot season the mid forest brake rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms and such too is the grandeur of the dooms we have imagined for the mighty dead all lovely tales that we have heard or read an endless fountain of immortal drink pouring unto us from the heaven 's brink nor do we merely feel these essences for one short hour no even as the trees that whisper round a temple become soon dear as the temple 's self so does the moon the passion poesy glories infinite haunt us till they become a cheering light unto our souls and bound to us so fast that whether there be shine or gloom o'ercast they always must be with us or we die therefore 't is with full happiness that i will trace the story of endymion the very music of the name has gone into my being and each pleasant scene is growing fresh before me as the green of our own valleys so i will begin now while i can not hear the city 's din now while the early budders are just new and run in mazes of the youngest hue about old forests while the willow trails its delicate amber and the dairy pails bring home increase of milk and as the year grows lush in juicy stalks i 'll smoothly steer my little boat for many quiet hours with streams that deepen freshly into bowers many and many a verse i hope to write before the daisies vermeil rimm 'd and white hide in deep herbage and ere yet the bees hum about globes of clover and sweet peas i must be near the middle of my story o may no wintry season bare and hoary see it half finish 'd but let autumn bold with universal tinge of sober gold be all about me when i make an end and now at once adventuresome i send my herald thought into a wilderness there let its trumpet blow and quickly dress my uncertain path with green that i may speed easily onward thorough flowers and weed
go dumb-born book tell her that sang me once that song of lawes hadst thou but song as thou hast subjects known then were there cause in thee that should condone even my faults that heavy upon me lie and build her glories their longevity tell her that sheds such treasure in the air recking naught else but that her graces give life to the moment i would bid them live as roses might in magic amber laid red overwrought with orange and all made one substance and one colour braving time tell her that goes with song upon her lips but sings not out the song nor knows the maker of it some other mouth may be as fair as hers might in new ages gain her worshippers when our two dusts with waller ’ s shall be laid siftings on siftings in oblivion till change hath broken down all things save beauty alone
at the midnight in the silence of the sleep-time when you set your fancies free will they pass to where—by death fools think imprisoned— low he lies who once so loved you whom you loved so —pity me oh to love so be so loved yet so mistaken what had i on earth to do with the slothful with the mawkish the unmanly like the aimless helpless hopeless did i drivel —being—who one who never turned his back but marched breast forward never doubted clouds would break never dreamed though right were worsted wrong would triumph held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better sleep to wake no at noonday in the bustle of man 's work-time greet the unseen with a cheer bid him forward breast and back as either should be '' strive and thrive '' cry `` speed —fight on fare ever there as here ''
my sister my sweet sister if a name dearer and purer were it should be thine mountains and seas divide us but i claim no tears but tenderness to answer mine go where i will to me thou art the same a lov 'd regret which i would not resign there yet are two things in my destiny— a world to roam through and a home with thee the first were nothing—had i still the last it were the haven of my happiness but other claims and other ties thou hast and mine is not the wish to make them less a strange doom is thy father 's son 's and past recalling as it lies beyond redress revers 'd for him our grandsire 's fate of yore— he had no rest at sea nor i on shore if my inheritance of storms hath been in other elements and on the rocks of perils overlook 'd or unforeseen i have sustain 'd my share of worldly shocks the fault was mine nor do i seek to screen my errors with defensive paradox i have been cunning in mine overthrow the careful pilot of my proper woe mine were my faults and mine be their reward my whole life was a contest since the day that gave me being gave me that which marr'd the gift—a fate or will that walk 'd astray and i at times have found the struggle hard and thought of shaking off my bonds of clay but now i fain would for a time survive if but to see what next can well arrive kingdoms and empires in my little day i have outliv 'd and yet i am not old and when i look on this the petty spray of my own years of trouble which have roll'd like a wild bay of breakers melts away something—i know not what—does still uphold a spirit of slight patience not in vain even for its own sake do we purchase pain perhaps the workings of defiance stir within me—or perhaps a cold despair brought on when ills habitually recur perhaps a kinder clime or purer air for even to this may change of soul refer and with light armour we may learn to bear have taught me a strange quiet which was not the chief companion of a calmer lot i feel almost at times as i have felt in happy childhood trees and flowers and brooks which do remember me of where i dwelt ere my young mind was sacrific 'd to books come as of yore upon me and can melt my heart with recognition of their looks and even at moments i could think i see some living thing to love—but none like thee here are the alpine landscapes which create a fund for contemplation to admire is a brief feeling of a trivial date but something worthier do such scenes inspire here to be lonely is not desolate for much i view which i could most desire and above all a lake i can behold lovelier not dearer than our own of old oh that thou wert but with me —but i grow the fool of my own wishes and forget the solitude which i have vaunted so has lost its praise in this but one regret there may be others which i less may show i am not of the plaintive mood and yet i feel an ebb in my philosophy and the tide rising in my alter 'd eye i did remind thee of our own dear lake by the old hall which may be mine no more leman 's is fair but think not i forsake the sweet remembrance of a dearer shore sad havoc time must with my memory make ere that or thou can fade these eyes before though like all things which i have lov 'd they are resign 'd for ever or divided far the world is all before me i but ask of nature that with which she will comply— it is but in her summer 's sun to bask to mingle with the quiet of her sky to see her gentle face without a mask and never gaze on it with apathy she was my early friend and now shall be my sister—till i look again on thee i can reduce all feelings but this one and that i would not for at length i see such scenes as those wherein my life begun the earliest—even the only paths for me— had i but sooner learnt the crowd to shun i had been better than i now can be the passions which have torn me would have slept i had not suffer 'd and thou hadst not wept with false ambition what had i to do little with love and least of all with fame and yet they came unsought and with me grew and made me all which they can make—a name yet this was not the end i did pursue surely i once beheld a nobler aim but all is over—i am one the more to baffled millions which have gone before and for the future this world 's future may from me demand but little of my care i have outliv 'd myself by many a day having surviv 'd so many things that were my years have been no slumber but the prey of ceaseless vigils for i had the share of life which might have fill 'd a century before its fourth in time had pass 'd me by and for the remnant which may be to come i am content and for the past i feel not thankless for within the crowded sum of struggles happiness at times would steal and for the present i would not benumb my feelings further nor shall i conceal that with all this i still can look around and worship nature with a thought profound for thee my own sweet sister in thy heart i know myself secure as thou in mine we were and are—i am even as thou art— beings who ne'er each other can resign it is the same together or apart from life 's commencement to its slow decline we are entwin'd—let death come slow or fast the tie which bound the first endures the last
st. agnes eve—ah bitter chill it was the owl for all his feathers was a-cold the hare limp 'd trembling through the frozen grass and silent was the flock in woolly fold numb were the beadsman 's fingers while he told his rosary and while his frosted breath like pious incense from a censer old seem 'd taking flight for heaven without a death past the sweet virgin 's picture while his prayer he saith his prayer he saith this patient holy man then takes his lamp and riseth from his knees and back returneth meagre barefoot wan along the chapel aisle by slow degrees the sculptur 'd dead on each side seem to freeze emprison 'd in black purgatorial rails knights ladies praying in dumb orat'ries he passeth by and his weak spirit fails to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails northward he turneth through a little door and scarce three steps ere music 's golden tongue flatter 'd to tears this aged man and poor but no—already had his deathbell rung the joys of all his life were said and sung his was harsh penance on st. agnes eve another way he went and soon among rough ashes sat he for his soul 's reprieve and all night kept awake for sinners sake to grieve that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft and so it chanc 'd for many a door was wide from hurry to and fro soon up aloft the silver snarling trumpets 'gan to chide the level chambers ready with their pride were glowing to receive a thousand guests the carved angels ever eager-eyed star 'd where upon their heads the cornice rests with hair blown back and wings put cross-wise on their breasts at length burst in the argent revelry with plume tiara and all rich array numerous as shadows haunting faerily the brain new stuff 'd in youth with triumphs gay of old romance these let us wish away and turn sole-thoughted to one lady there whose heart had brooded all that wintry day on love and wing 'd st. agnes saintly care as she had heard old dames full many times declare they told her how upon st. agnes eve young virgins might have visions of delight and soft adorings from their loves receive upon the honey 'd middle of the night if ceremonies due they did aright as supperless to bed they must retire and couch supine their beauties lily white nor look behind nor sideways but require of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire full of this whim was thoughtful madeline the music yearning like a god in pain she scarcely heard her maiden eyes divine fix 'd on the floor saw many a sweeping train pass by—she heeded not at all in vain came many a tiptoe amorous cavalier and back retir 'd not cool 'd by high disdain but she saw not her heart was otherwhere she sigh 'd for agnes dreams the sweetest of the year she danc 'd along with vague regardless eyes anxious her lips her breathing quick and short the hallow 'd hour was near at hand she sighs amid the timbrels and the throng 'd resort of whisperers in anger or in sport 'mid looks of love defiance hate and scorn hoodwink 'd with faery fancy all amort save to st. agnes and her lambs unshorn and all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn so purposing each moment to retire she linger 'd still meantime across the moors had come young porphyro with heart on fire for madeline beside the portal doors buttress 'd from moonlight stands he and implores all saints to give him sight of madeline but for one moment in the tedious hours that he might gaze and worship all unseen perchance speak kneel touch kiss—in sooth such things have been he ventures in let no buzz 'd whisper tell all eyes be muffled or a hundred swords will storm his heart love 's fev'rous citadel for him those chambers held barbarian hordes hyena foemen and hot-blooded lords whose very dogs would execrations howl against his lineage not one breast affords him any mercy in that mansion foul save one old beldame weak in body and in soul ah happy chance the aged creature came shuffling along with ivory-headed wand to where he stood hid from the torch 's flame behind a broad half-pillar far beyond the sound of merriment and chorus bland he startled her but soon she knew his face and grasp 'd his fingers in her palsied hand saying `` mercy porphyro hie thee from this place they are all here to-night the whole blood-thirsty race `` get hence get hence there 's dwarfish hildebrand he had a fever late and in the fit he cursed thee and thine both house and land then there 's that old lord maurice not a whit more tame for his gray hairs—alas me flit flit like a ghost away `` — '' ah gossip dear we 're safe enough here in this arm-chair sit and tell me how '' — '' good saints not here not here follow me child or else these stones will be thy bier '' he follow 'd through a lowly arched way brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume and as she mutter 'd `` well-a—well-a-day '' he found him in a little moonlight room pale lattic 'd chill and silent as a tomb `` now tell me where is madeline '' said he `` o tell me angela by the holy loom which none but secret sisterhood may see when they st. agnes wool are weaving piously '' `` st. agnes ah it is st. agnes eve— yet men will murder upon holy days thou must hold water in a witch 's sieve and be liege-lord of all the elves and fays to venture so it fills me with amaze to see thee porphyro —st agnes eve god 's help my lady fair the conjuror plays this very night good angels her deceive but let me laugh awhile i 've mickle time to grieve '' feebly she laugheth in the languid moon while porphyro upon her face doth look like puzzled urchin on an aged crone who keepeth clos 'd a wond'rous riddle-book as spectacled she sits in chimney nook but soon his eyes grew brilliant when she told his lady 's purpose and he scarce could brook tears at the thought of those enchantments cold and madeline asleep in lap of legends old sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose flushing his brow and in his pained heart made purple riot then doth he propose a stratagem that makes the beldame start `` a cruel man and impious thou art sweet lady let her pray and sleep and dream alone with her good angels far apart from wicked men like thee go go —i deem thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem '' `` i will not harm her by all saints i swear '' quoth porphyro `` o may i ne'er find grace when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer if one of her soft ringlets i displace or look with ruffian passion in her face good angela believe me by these tears or i will even in a moment 's space awake with horrid shout my foemen 's ears and beard them though they be more fang 'd than wolves and bears '' `` ah why wilt thou affright a feeble soul a poor weak palsy-stricken churchyard thing whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll whose prayers for thee each morn and evening were never miss 'd `` —thus plaining doth she bring a gentler speech from burning porphyro so woful and of such deep sorrowing that angela gives promise she will do whatever he shall wish betide her weal or woe which was to lead him in close secrecy even to madeline 's chamber and there hide him in a closet of such privacy that he might see her beauty unespy 'd and win perhaps that night a peerless bride while legion 'd faeries pac 'd the coverlet and pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey 'd never on such a night have lovers met since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt `` it shall be as thou wishest '' said the dame `` all cates and dainties shall be stored there quickly on this feast-night by the tambour frame her own lute thou wilt see no time to spare for i am slow and feeble and scarce dare on such a catering trust my dizzy head wait here my child with patience kneel in prayer the while ah thou must needs the lady wed or may i never leave my grave among the dead '' so saying she hobbled off with busy fear the lover 's endless minutes slowly pass 'd the dame return 'd and whisper 'd in his ear to follow her with aged eyes aghast from fright of dim espial safe at last through many a dusky gallery they gain the maiden 's chamber silken hush 'd and chaste where porphyro took covert pleas 'd amain his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade old angela was feeling for the stair when madeline st. agnes charmed maid rose like a mission 'd spirit unaware with silver taper 's light and pious care she turn 'd and down the aged gossip led to a safe level matting now prepare young porphyro for gazing on that bed she comes she comes again like ring-dove fray 'd and fled out went the taper as she hurried in its little smoke in pallid moonshine died she clos 'd the door she panted all akin to spirits of the air and visions wide no uttered syllable or woe betide but to her heart her heart was voluble paining with eloquence her balmy side as though a tongueless nightingale should swell her throat in vain and die heart-stifled in her dell a casement high and triple-arch 'd there was all garlanded with carven imag'ries of fruits and flowers and bunches of knot-grass and diamonded with panes of quaint device innumerable of stains and splendid dyes as are the tiger-moth 's deep-damask 'd wings and in the midst 'mong thousand heraldries and twilight saints and dim emblazonings a shielded scutcheon blush 'd with blood of queens and kings full on this casement shone the wintry moon and threw warm gules on madeline 's fair breast as down she knelt for heaven 's grace and boon rose-bloom fell on her hands together prest and on her silver cross soft amethyst and on her hair a glory like a saint she seem 'd a splendid angel newly drest save wings for heaven —porphyro grew faint she knelt so pure a thing so free from mortal taint anon his heart revives her vespers done of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees unclasps her warmed jewels one by one loosens her fragrant boddice by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees half-hidden like a mermaid in sea-weed pensive awhile she dreams awake and sees in fancy fair st. agnes in her bed but dares not look behind or all the charm is fled soon trembling in her soft and chilly nest in sort of wakeful swoon perplex 'd she lay until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd her soothed limbs and soul fatigued away flown like a thought until the morrow-day blissfully haven 'd both from joy and pain clasp 'd like a missal where swart paynims pray blinded alike from sunshine and from rain as though a rose should shut and be a bud again stol'n to this paradise and so entranced porphyro gaz 'd upon her empty dress and listen 'd to her breathing if it chanced to wake into a slumberous tenderness which when he heard that minute did he bless and breath 'd himself then from the closet crept noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness and over the hush 'd carpet silent stept and 'tween the curtains peep 'd where lo —how fast she slept then by the bed-side where the faded moon made a dim silver twilight soft he set a table and half anguish 'd threw thereon a cloth of woven crimson gold and jet — o for some drowsy morphean amulet the boisterous midnight festive clarion the kettle-drum and far-heard clarinet affray his ears though but in dying tone — the hall door shuts again and all the noise is gone and still she slept an azure-lidded sleep in blanched linen smooth and lavender 'd while he forth from the closet brought a heap of candied apple quince and plum and gourd with jellies soother than the creamy curd and lucent syrops tinct with cinnamon manna and dates in argosy transferr'd from fez and spiced dainties every one from silken samarcand to cedar 'd lebanon these delicates he heap 'd with glowing hand on golden dishes and in baskets bright of wreathed silver sumptuous they stand in the retired quiet of the night filling the chilly room with perfume light.— `` and now my love my seraph fair awake thou art my heaven and i thine eremite open thine eyes for meek st. agnes sake or i shall drowse beside thee so my soul doth ache '' thus whispering his warm unnerved arm sank in her pillow shaded was her dream by the dusk curtains —'twas a midnight charm impossible to melt as iced stream the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies it seem 'd he never never could redeem from such a stedfast spell his lady 's eyes so mus 'd awhile entoil 'd in woofed phantasies awakening up he took her hollow lute — tumultuous —and in chords that tenderest be he play 'd an ancient ditty long since mute in provence call 'd `` la belle dame sans mercy '' close to her ear touching the melody — wherewith disturb 'd she utter 'd a soft moan he ceas'd—she panted quick—and suddenly her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone upon his knees he sank pale as smooth-sculptured stone her eyes were open but she still beheld now wide awake the vision of her sleep there was a painful change that nigh expell'd the blisses of her dream so pure and deep at which fair madeline began to weep and moan forth witless words with many a sigh while still her gaze on porphyro would keep who knelt with joined hands and piteous eye fearing to move or speak she look 'd so dreamingly `` ah porphyro '' said she `` but even now thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear made tuneable with every sweetest vow and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear how chang 'd thou art how pallid chill and drear give me that voice again my porphyro those looks immortal those complainings dear oh leave me not in this eternal woe for if thy diest my love i know not where to go '' beyond a mortal man impassion 'd far at these voluptuous accents he arose ethereal flush 'd and like a throbbing star seen mid the sapphire heaven 's deep repose into her dream he melted as the rose blendeth its odour with the violet — solution sweet meantime the frost-wind blows like love 's alarum pattering the sharp sleet against the window-panes st. agnes moon hath set 't is dark quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet `` this is no dream my bride my madeline '' 't is dark the iced gusts still rave and beat `` no dream alas alas and woe is mine porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.— cruel what traitor could thee hither bring i curse not for my heart is lost in thine though thou forsakest a deceived thing — a dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing '' `` my madeline sweet dreamer lovely bride say may i be for aye thy vassal blest thy beauty 's shield heart-shap 'd and vermeil dyed ah silver shrine here will i take my rest after so many hours of toil and quest a famish 'd pilgrim —sav 'd by miracle though i have found i will not rob thy nest saving of thy sweet self if thou think'st well to trust fair madeline to no rude infidel `` hark 't is an elfin-storm from faery land of haggard seeming but a boon indeed arise—arise the morning is at hand — the bloated wassaillers will never heed — let us away my love with happy speed there are no ears to hear or eyes to see — drown 'd all in rhenish and the sleepy mead awake arise my love and fearless be for o'er the southern moors i have a home for thee '' she hurried at his words beset with fears for there were sleeping dragons all around at glaring watch perhaps with ready spears— down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.— in all the house was heard no human sound a chain-droop 'd lamp was flickering by each door the arras rich with horseman hawk and hound flutter 'd in the besieging wind 's uproar and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor they glide like phantoms into the wide hall like phantoms to the iron porch they glide where lay the porter in uneasy sprawl with a huge empty flaggon by his side the wakeful bloodhound rose and shook his hide but his sagacious eye an inmate owns by one and one the bolts full easy slide — the chains lie silent on the footworn stones — the key turns and the door upon its hinges groans and they are gone ay ages long ago these lovers fled away into the storm that night the baron dreamt of many a woe and all his warrior-guests with shade and form of witch and demon and large coffin-worm were long be-nightmar 'd angela the old died palsy-twitch 'd with meagre face deform the beadsman after thousand aves told for aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold
when love was a question the message arrived in the beak of a wire and plaster bird the coloratura was hardly to be believed for flight it took three stagehands two on the pulleys and one on the flute and you thought fancy rained like grace our fog machine lost in the parcel post we improvised with smoke the heroine dies of tuberculosis after all remorse and the raw night air any plausible tenor might cough the passions i take my clues from an obvious source may be less like climatic events than we conventionalize though i ’ ve heard of tornadoes that break the second-best glassware and leave everything else untouched there ’ s a finer conviction than seamlessness elicits the greeks knew a god by the clanking behind his descent the heart poor pump protests till you ’ d think it ’ s rusted past redemption but there ’ s tuning in these counterweights celebration ’ s assembled voice
to make a final conquest of all me love did compose so sweet an enemy in whom both beauties to my death agree joining themselves in fatal harmony that while she with her eyes my heart does bind she with her voice might captivate my mind i could have fled from one but singly fair my disentangled soul itself might save breaking the curled trammels of her hair but how should i avoid to be her slave whose subtle art invisibly can wreath my fetters of the very air i breathe it had been easy fighting in some plain where victory might hang in equal choice but all resistance against her is vain who has th ’ advantage both of eyes and voice and all my forces needs must be undone she having gained both the wind and sun
you flinch something flickers not fleeing your face my heart hammers at the ceiling telling my tongue to turn it down too late the something climbs leaps is falling now across us like the prank of an icy brainy lord i chose the wrong word i am wrong for not choosing merely to smile to pull you toward me and away from what you think of as that other me who wanders lost among ... among whom the many the rare i wish you didn ’ t care i watch you watching her her very shadow is a rage that trashes the rooms of your eyes do you claim surprise at what she wants the poor girl pelted with despair who flits from grief to grief isn ’ t it you she seeks and if you blame her know that she blames you for choosing not her but me love is never fair but do we — should we — care
what we have is what there is and who we are and who we is is love
stranger you who hide my love in the curved cheek of a smile and sleep with her upon a tongue of soft lies that beguile your paradisal ecstasy is justified is justified by hunger of the beasts beneath the overhanging cloud who to snatch quick pleasures run before their momentary sun be eclipsed by death lightly lightly from my sleep she stole our vows of dew to break upon a day of melting rain another love to take her happy happy perfidy was justified was justified since compulsive needs of sense clamour to be satisfied and she was never one to miss plausible happiness of a new experience i who stand beneath a bitter blasted tree with the green life of summer joy cut from my side by that self-justifying knife in my exiled misery were justified were justified if upon two lives i preyed or punished with my suicide or murdered pity in my heart or two other lives did part to make the world pay what i paid oh but supposing that i climb alone to a high room of clouds up a ladder of the time and lie upon a bed alone and tear a feather from a wing and listen to the world below and write round my high paper walls anything and everything which i know and do not know
ever let the fancy roam pleasure never is at home at a touch sweet pleasure melteth like to bubbles when rain pelteth then let winged fancy wander through the thought still spread beyond her open wide the mind 's cage-door she 'll dart forth and cloudward soar o sweet fancy let her loose summer 's joys are spoilt by use and the enjoying of the spring fades as does its blossoming autumn 's red-lipp 'd fruitage too blushing through the mist and dew cloys with tasting what do then sit thee by the ingle when the sear faggot blazes bright spirit of a winter 's night when the soundless earth is muffled and the caked snow is shuffled from the ploughboy 's heavy shoon when the night doth meet the noon in a dark conspiracy to banish even from her sky sit thee there and send abroad with a mind self-overaw 'd fancy high-commission 'd —send her she has vassals to attend her she will bring in spite of frost beauties that the earth hath lost she will bring thee all together all delights of summer weather all the buds and bells of may from dewy sward or thorny spray all the heaped autumn 's wealth with a still mysterious stealth she will mix these pleasures up like three fit wines in a cup and thou shalt quaff it —thou shalt hear distant harvest-carols clear rustle of the reaped corn sweet birds antheming the morn and in the same moment hark 't is the early april lark or the rooks with busy caw foraging for sticks and straw thou shalt at one glance behold the daisy and the marigold white-plum 'd lillies and the first hedge-grown primrose that hath burst shaded hyacinth alway sapphire queen of the mid-may and every leaf and every flower pearled with the self-same shower thou shalt see the field-mouse peep meagre from its celled sleep and the snake all winter-thin cast on sunny bank its skin freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see hatching in the hawthorn-tree when the hen-bird 's wing doth rest quiet on her mossy nest then the hurry and alarm when the bee-hive casts its swarm acorns ripe down-pattering while the autumn breezes sing oh sweet fancy let her loose every thing is spoilt by use where 's the cheek that doth not fade too much gaz 'd at where 's the maid whose lip mature is ever new where 's the eye however blue doth not weary where 's the face one would meet in every place where 's the voice however soft one would hear so very oft at a touch sweet pleasure melteth like to bubbles when rain pelteth let then winged fancy find thee a mistress to thy mind dulcet-ey 'd as ceres daughter ere the god of torment taught her how to frown and how to chide with a waist and with a side white as hebe 's when her zone slipt its golden clasp and down fell her kirtle to her feet while she held the goblet sweet and jove grew languid.—break the mesh of the fancy 's silken leash quickly break her prison-string and such joys as these she 'll bring.— let the winged fancy roam pleasure never is at home

i never knew the earth had so much gold— the fields run over with it and this hill hoary and old is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill such golden fires such yellow—lo how good this spendthrift world and what a lavish god this fringe of wood blazing with buttercup and goldenrod you too beloved are changed again i see your face grow mystical as on that night you turned to me and all the trembling world—and you—were white aye you are touched your singing lips grow dumb the fields absorb you color you entire and you become a goddess standing in a world of fire
afterwards you had that drunk drugged look my daughter used to get when she had let go of my nipple her mouth gone slack and her eyes turned vague and filmy as though behind them the milk was rising up to fill her whole head that would loll on the small white stalk of her neck so i would have to hold her closer amazed at the sheer power of satiety which was nothing like the needing to be fed the wild flailing and crying until she fastened herself to me and made the seal tight between us and sucked drawing the liquid down and out of my body no this was the crowning moment this giving of herself knowing she could show me how helpless she was—that ’ s what i saw that night when you pulled your mouth from mine and leaned back against a chain-link fence in front of a burned-out church a man who was going to be that vulnerable that easy and impossible to hurt
what i wanted seemed little enough at the time there was snow on the ground grayish and sticking to the mud—the promise of plenty to come snow gathered already in the corners of sills when she spoke what we had sensed for weeks without saying her voice fell clear unwavering soft as the day it hardly had to do with us anymore the crazy tilt of the carport across the alley was all i could see for awhile the weight on its wobbly roof like a terrible joke but that was wrong—that was wrong before long the snows shook down on what we had done what i wanted was to ignore it all sit there in stillness shepherding logs to the fire while the old ones went pink to white to gray

follow your saint follow with accents sweet haste you sad notes fall at her flying feet there wrapp 'd in cloud of sorrow pity move and tell the ravisher of my soul i perish for her love but if she scorns my never-ceasing pain then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again all that i sung still to her praise did tend still she was first still she my songs did end yet she my love and music both doth fly the music that her echo is and beauty 's sympathy then let my notes pursue her scornful flight it shall suffice that they were breath 'd and died for her delight
thank heaven the crisis the danger is past and the lingering illness is over at last— and the fever called `` living '' is conquered at last sadly i know i am shorn of my strength and no muscle i move as i lie at full length— but no matter —i feel i am better at length and i rest so composedly now in my bed that any beholder might fancy me dead— might start at beholding me thinking me dead the moaning and groaning the sighing and sobbing are quieted now with that horrible throbbing at heart —ah that horrible horrible throbbing the sickness—the nausea— the pitiless pain— have ceased with the fever that maddened my brain— with the fever called `` living '' that burned in my brain and oh of all tortures that torture the worst has abated—the terrible torture of thirst for the naphthaline river of passion accurst — i have drank of a water that quenches all thirst — of a water that flows with a lullaby sound from a spring but a very few feet under ground— from a cavern not very far down under ground and ah let it never be foolishly said that my room it is gloomy and narrow my bed for man never slept in a different bed— and to sleep you must slumber in just such a bed my tantalized spirit here blandly reposes forgetting or never regretting its roses— its old agitations of myrtles and roses for now while so quietly lying it fancies a holier odor about it of pansies— a rosemary odor commingled with pansies— with rue and the beautiful puritan pansies and so it lies happily bathing in many a dream of the truth and the beauty of annie— drowned in a bath of the tresses of annie she tenderly kissed me she fondly caressed and then i fell gently to sleep on her breast— deeply to sleep from the heaven of her breast when the light was extinguished she covered me warm and she prayed to the angels to keep me from harm— to the queen of the angels to shield me from harm and i lie so composedly now in my bed knowing her love that you fancy me dead— and i rest so contentedly now in my bed with her love at my breast that you fancy me dead— that you shudder to look at me thinking me dead — but my heart it is brighter than all of the many stars in the sky for it sparkles with annie— it glows with the light of the love of my annie— with the thought of the light of the eyes of my annie

siwashing it out once in siuslaw forest i slept under rhododendron all night blossoms fell shivering on a sheet of cardboard feet stuck in my pack hands deep in my pockets barely able to sleep i remembered when we were in school sleeping together in a big warm bed we were the youngest lovers when we broke up we were still nineteen now our friends are married you teach school back east i dont mind living this way green hills the long blue beach but sometimes sleeping in the open i think back when i had you a spring night in shokoku-ji eight years ago this may we walked under cherry blossoms at night in an orchard in oregon all that i wanted then is forgotten now but you here in the night in a garden of the old capital i feel the trembling ghost of yugao i remember your cool body naked under a summer cotton dress an autumn morning in shokoku-ji last night watching the pleiades breath smoking in the moonlight bitter memory like vomit choked my throat i unrolled a sleeping bag on mats on the porch under thick autumn stars in dream you appeared three times in nine years wild cold and accusing i woke shamed and angry the pointless wars of the heart almost dawn venus and jupiter the first time i have ever seen them close december at yase you said that october in the tall dry grass by the orchard when you chose to be free “ again someday maybe ten years. ” after college i saw you one time you were strange and i was obsessed with a plan now ten years and more have gone by i ’ ve always known where you were— i might have gone to you hoping to win your love back you still are single i didn ’ t i thought i must make it alone i have done that only in dream like this dawn does the grave awed intensity of our young love return to my mind to my flesh we had what the others all crave and seek for we left it behind at nineteen i feel ancient as though i had lived many lives and may never now know if i am a fool or have done what my karma demands
i love though for this you riddle me with darts and drag me at your chariot till i die — oh heavy prince oh panderer of hearts — yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie who shout you mighty thick about my hair day in day out your ominous arrows purr who still am free unto no querulous care a fool and in no temple worshiper i that have bared me to your quiver 's fire lifted my face into its puny rain do wreathe you impotent to evoke desire as you are powerless to elicit pain now will the god for blasphemy so brave punish me surely with the shaft i crave ii i think i should have loved you presently and given in earnest words i flung in jest and lifted honest eyes for you to see and caught your hand against my cheek and breast and all my pretty follies flung aside that won you to me and beneath your gaze naked of reticence and shorn of pride spread like a chart my little wicked ways i that had been to you had you remained but one more waking from a recurrent dream cherish no less the certain stakes i gained and walk your memory 's halls austere supreme a ghost in marble of a girl you knew who would have loved you in a day or two iii oh think not i am faithful to a vow faithless am i save to love 's self alone were you not lovely i would leave you now after the feet of beauty fly my own were you not still my hunger 's rarest food and water ever to my wildest thirst i would desert you — think not but i would — and seek another as i sought you first but you are mobile as the veering air and all your charms more changeful than the tide wherefore to be inconstant is no care i have but to continue at your side so wanton light and false my love are you i am most faithless when i most am true iv i shall forget you presently my dear so make the most of this your little day your little month your little half a year ere i forget or die or move away and we are done forever by and by i shall forget you as i said but now if you entreat me with your loveliest lie i will protest you with my favorite vow i would indeed that love were longer-lived and vows were not so brittle as they are but so it is and nature has contrived to struggle on without a break thus far — whether or not we find what we are seeking is idle biologically speaking
love while nothing satisfies not morning ’ s bleary mirror or the slick embrace at hand consider our mutual jewel an untouching a pouring into sweet emptied arms called worth and habit hey you there change of mind eh so it is these comic-book poses that promise softer years quite bearable as amnesia or sex sex tough talkers their brain-pans fried black from a constant heat turn out swell on the boulevard strolling in evening wear appearances being unavoidable as the urge to keep tuned even stars seems to itch for more for a squeeze of all our drizzling nothings save time time leaning out from this wayside planet you witness another life blown like glass without pattern or fatuous secret yet a limited edition of uncertain radius presume then to be home a part dismantled by continuity some guiding light phasing on and off like an unoriginal religion religion get far up and hard in the hole between dead of winter skies and beyond limits of ourselves documented by precinct greeted cordially by scandal too soon allegiance becomes resistance and otherwise meanwhile after a holy pinch in the ass you are often saved and perhaps in love
though friendships differ endless in degree the sorts methinks may be reduced to three ac quaintance many and con quaintance few but for in quaintance i know only two— the friend i 've mourned with and the maid i woo
whom should i choose for my judge the earnest impersonal reader who in the work forgets me and the world and himself ye who have eyes to detect and gall to chastise the imperfect have you the heart too that loves feels and rewards the compleat what is the meed of thy song 't is the ceaseless the thousandfold echo which from the welcoming hearts of the pure repeats and prolongs it each with a different tone compleat or in musical fragments
i. when his dogs leapt on actaeon he cried did he cry out —he flung his arm to command they tore his hand from the wrist stump tore guts from his belly through the tunic ripped the cry from his throat that ’ s how we know a god when the facts leap at the tenderest innards and we know the god is what we can ’ t change you stood over me as i woke i opened my eyes i saw that i ’ d seen and that it was too late the seeing of you in the doorway with weak electric light fanning behind you in the hall and my room and narrow pallet steeped in shadow were what i couldn ’ t change and distantly i wanted you and as distantly i heard the dogs baying ii and yet the fountain spends itself and it is in the clear light of its losing that we seem to take delight you dipped your hand in its running braid to sprinkle my forehead my lips garden deities observed us three nymphs with moss staining their haunches a pug-nosed faun the wound in water closed perfectly around your gesture erasing it so that only the glimmer swiftly drying on my face recalled our interruption of the faultless cold passionate perpetual idea of the stream ’ s descent— which unlike ours would always be renewed iii i kissed a flame what did i expect those days you painted in fire tangerine gold one would have had to be a pilgrim to walk through that wall of molten glass and purification could be conceived if not attained only after many years in autumn in a fire greater than yours though menstrual blood still tinged the threshold and our ex-votos were sordid—scraps of blistered flesh taped to kitsch prayer cards—and neither of us knew the object of this exercise except having inadvertently each of us burned we recognized the smell of wood smoke the slow swirl flakes of wood ash make in heavy air and we were ready each in a private way to make the gifts the season required mine was the scene of my young self in your arms eyes in your eyes clutched in the effort to give each other away—when i glimpsed behind your pleasure fear behind fear anger and knew in a bolt some gifts conceal a greater gift i have kept it now i am ready to give it back into darker flame in this season of goldenrod the ardent weed and queen anne ’ s lace in its mantilla of ash and yet how lumpishly how stupidly i stand how much that is human will never burn iv and if you should answer i listened years before i knew you to the whine of wind through the high stony pastures above my childhood village i breathed lavender and thyme and burned my bare legs on nettles scraped them on thistles and rubbed the sore skin till it reddened all the more when we walked the uplands together you burned your hand and i kissed the crimsoning nettle-rash “ we are the lords of need ” you said hafiz said and i believed you and we were in the rugs of your country carmine is crushed from insects cochineal saffron gold is boiled from crocus stamens and indigo of heaven and fountain pools is soaked hours upon hours from indigo leaves “ like the angel harut ” you said “ we are in the calamity of love-desire. ” the angel is chained by neck and knees head down in the pit of babel for falling in love your carpets told a different story scarlet and saffron blush as in paradise and god reveals himself in wine flame tulips and the light in a mortal eye all night you held me sleepless on my childhood cot in the stone house all night the wind seethed through crags and twisted olive trees high on the scents of thyme and goat droppings “ all night ” hafiz sang “ i hope the breeze of dawn will cherish the lovers. ” but the breeze of dawn is the angel of death you are in your far landscape now i am in mine the wind complains and i can ’ t understand the words and if you should answer you ten years away in a different wind “ we are in the calamity ” hafiz sang “ but tell the tale of the minstrel and of wine and leave time alone time is a mystery no skill will solve. ” we should thread words like pearls you said and the grateful sky would scatter the pleiades upon us though we couldn ’ t see and that was long ago v. the carpet is not a story it is a place garden of crisscrossed pathways labyrinth fountain pool and stream as though the fabric had ripped at the vanishing point at the top of the street of ashen façades and slate-sloped roofs you stepped through the gap out of your own world i had already lost my world we met in a torn design which we tore further pulling the tall warp thread wrapped tightly around our fingers until it bit the flesh and the rue de lille unravelled i know about design it ’ s my job arranging other people ’ s letters in star charts that phosphoresce in the dark between the closed covers of books you knew about design from the holes blown through your country we spoke in a language of no country on earth you moved slowly in shadow teaching the shadows to echo my name you ripped my shirt at the neck was it the beloved i held holding you down the middle of the carpet the river weaves a thousand gray glimmers into the deeper green the river knows about mourning that ’ s its job how many years has it practiced with such fleet fingers a man woke me at dawn this morning sobbing and cursing in the street reeling from sidewalk to gutter and back again on my long gray street the rue de lille where i still live
tulsidas the poet was wandering deep in thought by the ganges in that lonely spot where they burn their dead he found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband gaily dressed as for a wedding she rose as she saw him bowed to him and said `` permit me master with your blessing to follow my husband to heaven '' `` why such hurry my daughter '' asked tulsidas `` is not this earth also his who made heaven '' `` for heaven i do not long '' said the woman `` i want my husband '' tulsidas smiled and said to her `` go back to your home my child before the month is over you will find your husband '' the woman went back with glad hope tulsidas came to her every day and gave her high thoughts to think till her heart was filled to the brim with divine love when the month was scarcely over her neighbours came to her asking `` woman have you found your husband '' the widow smiled and said `` i have '' eagerly they asked `` where is he '' `` in my heart is my lord one with me '' said the woman
i eventually we must combine nightmares an angel smoking a cigarette on the steps of the last national bank said to me i put her out with my thumb i don ’ t need that cheap talk i ’ ve got my own problems it was sad exciting and horrible it was exciting horrible and sad it was horrible sad and exciting it was inviting mad and deplorable it was adorable glad and enticing eventually we must smoke a thumb cheap talk i ’ ve got my own angel on the steps of the problems the bank said to me i don ’ t need that i will take this one window with its sooty maps and scratches so that my dreams will remember one another and so that my eyes will not become blinded by the new world ii the flames don ’ t dance or slither they have painted the room green beautiful and naked the wives are sleeping before the fire now it is out the men have returned to the shacks slaved creatures from the forest floor across their white stationwagons that just about does it says the other dumping her bucket over her head well i guess we got everything says one feeling around in the mud as if for a child now they remember they want that mud who can ’ t remember what they got up for they parcel it out when they are drunk enough they go into town with a bucket of mud saying we can slice it up into windmills like a bloated cow later they paint the insides of the shack black and sit sucking eggs all night they want something real useful but there isn ’ t anything iii i will engineer the sunrise they have disassembled our shadows our echoes are erased from the walls your nipples are the skeletons of olives your nipples are an oriental delight your nipples blow away like cigarette papers your nipples are the mouths of mutes so i am not here any longer skein of lightning memory ’ s dark ink in your last smile where the stars have swallowed their train schedule where the stars have drowned in their dark petticoats like a sock of hamburger receiving the lightning into his clitoris red on red the prisoner confesses his waltz through the corkscrew lightning nevermind the lightning in your teeth let ’ s waltz i am the hashish pinball machine that rapes a piano
whoever comes to shroud me do not harm nor question much that subtle wreath of hair which crowns my arm the mystery the sign you must not touch for 't is my outward soul viceroy to that which then to heaven being gone will leave this to control and keep these limbs her provinces from dissolution for if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall through every part can tie those parts and make me one of all those hairs which upward grew and strength and art have from a better brain can better do'it except she meant that i by this should know my pain as prisoners then are manacled when they'are condemn 'd to die whate'er she meant by'it bury it with me for since i am love 's martyr it might breed idolatry if into other hands these relics came as 't was humility to afford to it all that a soul can do so 't is some bravery that since you would have none of me i bury some of you
i went to the garden of love and saw what i never had seen a chapel was built in the midst where i used to play on the green and the gates of this chapel were shut and thou shalt not writ over the door so i turn 'd to the garden of love that so many sweet flowers bore and i saw it was filled with graves and tomb-stones where flowers should be and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds and binding with briars my joys desires

my love once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his mind alas i was not careful and it struck your ringing anklets and came to grief it broke up into scraps of songs and lay scattered at your feet all my cargo of the stories of old wars was tossed by the laughing waves and soaked in tears and sank you must make this loss good to me my love if my claims to immortal fame after death are shattered make me immortal while i live and i will not mourn for my loss nor blame you
after pavese under the trellised arbor and our supper ’ s over in the memory i ’ ve found myself inside l not speaking and beside us the river sliding softly by now the light will fade to moonlit water and in memory i work to make this lingering accurate and sweet white ouzo and her hand that lifts the grapes first to her lips then to mine i may as well speak to moonlight as to her and the walls of bruges light up again a costume jewelry pearl string her profile and her shawl hugged tight against the breeze in memory ’ s flammable celluloid—flaring and gone replaced by bread and grapes a checkered tablecloth the two chairs stare each other down empty now upon which moonlight flickered all night the bread and grapes drip mist as dawn carves the morning with a chilly wind slicing away both moon and fog now someone without a name appears—first the fevered hands dustdevil quick that grope for the food in vain then the pale light shows the open mouth and rippling throat white face on black water sparrow-flock fast its spiraling path but the bread and grapes stay where they were their smell tormenting that famished ghost helpless to even lick away the dew that gathers on the grapes blue fluted sides of the wineglasses dawnlight everything dripping wet and the chairs stare at each other alone sometimes on the riverbank you can sense an odor—of grapes or sex or memory it swirls through the moonlit grass and now wakes someone always mute someone without a body weaving also through the half-lit grass the hoarse wail of someone who can not speak who reaches out but can not touch the grass and only the nostrils flare now the dawn will break late autumn cold to crave so endlessly the warmth— the blood-pulsing fingertip the body to embrace the pungent smells commingling to rise like breath and slither through the trees and tangle every branch in this unappeasable longing this endless lust for touch and smell which afflicts the dead the souls in the trees face the gathering light other times in the ground the rain torments them
when she rises in the morning i linger to watch her she spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window and the sunbeams catch her glistening white on the shoulders while down her sides the mellow golden shadow glows as she stoops to the sponge and her swung breasts sway like full-blown yellow gloire de dijon roses she drips herself with water and her shoulders glisten as silver they crumple up like wet and falling roses and i listen for the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals in the window full of sunlight concentrates her golden shadow fold on fold until it glows as mellow as the glory roses
king francis was a hearty king and loved a royal sport and one day as his lions fought sat looking on the court the nobles filled the benches and the ladies in their pride and 'mongst them sat the count de lorge with one for whom he sighed and truly 't was a gallant thing to see that crowning show valour and love and a king above and the royal beasts below ramped and roared the lions with horrid laughing jaws they bit they glared gave blows like beams a wind went with their paws with wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother the bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air said francis then `` faith gentlemen we 're better here than there '' de lorge 's love o'erheard the king a beauteous lively dame with smiling lips and sharp bright eyes which always seemed the same she thought the count my lover is brave as brave can be he surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me king ladies lovers all look on the occasion is divine i 'll drop my glove to prove his love great glory will be mine she dropped her glove to prove his love then looked at him and smiled he bowed and in a moment leaped among the lions wild the leap was quick return was quick he has regained his place then threw the glove but not with love right in the lady 's face `` by god '' said francis `` rightly done '' and he rose from where he sat '' no love '' quoth he `` but vanity sets love a task like that ''
i wonder by my troth what thou and i did till we loved were we not weaned till then but sucked on country pleasures childishly or snorted we in the seven sleepers ’ den ’ twas so but this all pleasures fancies be if ever any beauty i did see which i desired and got ’ twas but a dream of thee and now good-morrow to our waking souls which watch not one another out of fear for love all love of other sights controls and makes one little room an everywhere let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone let maps to other worlds on worlds have shown let us possess one world each hath one and is one my face in thine eye thine in mine appears and true plain hearts do in the faces rest where can we find two better hemispheres without sharp north without declining west whatever dies was not mixed equally if our two loves be one or thou and i love so alike that none do slacken none can die
on the long shore lit by the moon to show them properly alone two lovers suddenly embraced so that their shadows were as one the ordinary night was graced for them by the swift tide of blood that silently they took at flood and for a little time they prized themselves emparadised then as if shaken by stage-fright beneath the hard moon ’ s bony light they stood together on the sand embarrassed in each other ’ s sight but still conspiring hand in hand until they saw there underfoot as though the world had found them out the goose fish turning up though dead his hugely grinning head there in the china light he lay most ancient and corrupt and grey they hesitated at his smile wondering what it seemed to say to lovers who a little while before had thought to understand by violence upon the sand the only way that could be known to make a world their own it was a wide and moony grin together peaceful and obscene they knew not what he would express so finished a comedian he might mean failure or success but took it for an emblem of their sudden new and guilty love to be observed by when they kissed that rigid optimist so he became their patriarch dreadfully mild in the half-dark his throat that the sand seemed to choke his picket teeth these left their mark but never did explain the joke that so amused him lying there while the moon went down to disappear along the still and tilted track that bears the zodiac
if but some vengeful god would call to me from up the sky and laugh “ thou suffering thing know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy that thy love 's loss is my hate 's profiting ” then would i bear it clench myself and die steeled by the sense of ire unmerited half-eased in that a powerfuller than i had willed and meted me the tears i shed but not so how arrives it joy lies slain and why unblooms the best hope ever sown —crass casualty obstructs the sun and rain and dicing time for gladness casts a moan these purblind doomsters had as readily strown blisses about my pilgrimage as pain

if you undo your do you would be strange hair has been on my mind i used to lean in the doorway and watch my stony woman wind the copper through the black and play with my understanding show me she cóuld take a cup of river water and watch it shimmy watch it change turn around and become ash bone wind in the cottonwoods wakes me to a day so thin its breastbone shows so paid out it shakes me free of its blue dust i will arrange that river water bottom juice i conjure my head in the stream and ride with the silk feel of it as my woman bathes me and shaves away the scorn sponges the grit of solitude from my skin laves the salt water of self-esteem over my feathering body how like joy to come upon me in remembering a head of hair and the way water would caress it and stress beauty in the flair and cut of the only witness to my dance under sorrow 's tree this swift darkness is spring 's first hour i carried my life like a stone in a ragged pocket but i had a true weaving song a sly way with rhythm a healing tone

my mare when she was in heat would travel the fenceline for hours wearing the impatience in her feet into the ground not a stallion for miles i ’ d assure her give it up she ’ d widen her nostrils sieve the wind for news be moving again her underbelly darkening with sweat then stop at the gate a moment wait to see what i might do oh i knew how it was for her easily recognized myself in that wide lust came to stand in the pasture just to see it played offered a hand a bucket of grain— a minute ’ s distraction from passion the most i gave then she ’ d return to what burned her the fence the fence so hoping i might see might let her free i ’ d envy her then to be so restlessly sure of heat and need and what it takes to feed the wanting that we are— only a gap to open the width of a mare the rest would take care of itself surely surely i knew that who had the power of bucket and bridle— she would beseech me sidle up be gone as life is short but desire desire is long
the first sestiad excerpt on hellespont guilty of true love 's blood in view and opposite two cities stood sea-borderers disjoin 'd by neptune 's might the one abydos the other sestos hight at sestos

artificial flowers and leaves whose workmanship both man and beast deceives many would praise the sweet smell as she past when 't was the odour which her breath forth cast and there for honey bees have sought in vain and beat from thence have lighted there again about her neck hung chains of pebble-stone which lighten 'd by her neck like diamonds shone she ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind would burn or parch her hands but to her mind or warm or cool them for they took delight to play upon those hands they were so white buskins of shells all silver 'd used she and branch 'd with blushing coral to the knee where sparrows perch 'd of hollow pearl and gold such as the world would wonder to behold those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills which as she went would chirrup

part one the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor and the highwayman came riding— riding—riding— the highwayman came riding up to the old inn-door he ’ d a french cocked-hat on his forehead a bunch of lace at his chin a coat of the claret velvet and breeches of brown doe-skin they fitted with never a wrinkle his boots were up to the thigh and he rode with a jewelled twinkle his pistol butts a-twinkle his rapier hilt a-twinkle under the jewelled sky over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard he tapped with his whip on the shutters but all was locked and barred he whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting there but the landlord ’ s black-eyed daughter bess the landlord ’ s daughter plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair and dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked where tim the ostler listened his face was white and peaked his eyes were hollows of madness his hair like mouldy hay but he loved the landlord ’ s daughter the landlord ’ s red-lipped daughter dumb as a dog he listened and he heard the robber say— “ one kiss my bonny sweetheart i ’ m after a prize to-night but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light yet if they press me sharply and harry me through the day then look for me by moonlight watch for me by moonlight i ’ ll come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way. ” he rose upright in the stirrups he scarce could reach her hand but she loosened her hair in the casement his face burnt like a brand as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast and he kissed its waves in the moonlight o sweet black waves in the moonlight then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight and galloped away to the west part two he did not come in the dawning he did not come at noon and out of the tawny sunset before the rise of the moon when the road was a gypsy ’ s ribbon looping the purple moor a red-coat troop came marching— marching—marching— king george ’ s men came marching up to the old inn-door they said no word to the landlord they drank his ale instead but they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed two of them knelt at her casement with muskets at their side there was death at every window and hell at one dark window for bess could see through her casement the road that he would ride they had tied her up to attention with many a sniggering jest they had bound a musket beside her with the muzzle beneath her breast “ now keep good watch ” and they kissed her she heard the doomed man say— look for me by moonlight watch for me by moonlight i ’ ll come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way she twisted her hands behind her but all the knots held good she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood they stretched and strained in the darkness and the hours crawled by like years till now on the stroke of midnight cold on the stroke of midnight the tip of one finger touched it the trigger at least was hers the tip of one finger touched it she strove no more for the rest up she stood up to attention with the muzzle beneath her breast she would not risk their hearing she would not strive again for the road lay bare in the moonlight blank and bare in the moonlight and the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love ’ s refrain tlot-tlot tlot-tlot had they heard it the horsehoofs ringing clear tlot-tlot tlot-tlot in the distance were they deaf that they did not hear down the ribbon of moonlight over the brow of the hill the highwayman came riding— riding—riding— the red coats looked to their priming she stood up straight and still tlot-tlot in the frosty silence tlot-tlot in the echoing night nearer he came and nearer her face was like a light her eyes grew wide for a moment she drew one last deep breath then her finger moved in the moonlight her musket shattered the moonlight shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death he turned he spurred to the west he did not know who stood bowed with her head o ’ er the musket drenched with her own blood not till the dawn he heard it and his face grew grey to hear how bess the landlord ’ s daughter the landlord ’ s black-eyed daughter had watched for her love in the moonlight and died in the darkness there back he spurred like a madman shrieking a curse to the sky with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high blood red were his spurs in the golden noon wine-red was his velvet coat when they shot him down on the highway down like a dog on the highway and he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat and still of a winter ’ s night they say when the wind is in the trees when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor a highwayman comes riding— riding—riding— a highwayman comes riding up to the old inn-door over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard he taps with his whip on the

the sun frets a fat wafer falling like a trap of failed mesh i watch the pin-glare of a mockingbird ’ s eye cut sharply descend on the blank water then emerge from himself naked as a girl who shimmered here once for me if we come back like penitents to kneel over water bass swirling scattering the mayflies that often in silence graze lips what is the word floating out from the mouth unbearable as a bird ’ s black grin or a madman ’ s lust the word is not we but me giving it again and again brings no one out of the willows and i willing to believe like a sap in whatever dives or rises hear no voice but the mist sizzling on stones i lift my head for echoes out of trees for the flashed recoil of flesh hung cheap and gaudy wingless above the stab of water that crunched her like a beer can toads honk the only answer among them a boy i felt the grotesque pull of the moon all night peeled and went slowly down in terror rising falling through the pulpy leaves until the sun caught me drained and i was no one wanted so walked away from all knowing walked into town and drank calmly an illegal beer then slept the hooks in hairy hands clawed it smooth as a dish a super- human search by flood and fire light what could they find like many i have been out of town a long time i wish the face floating above the chill at my knees opened the door of a drab hotel i wish it said go to hell or do you know what time it is anything that if i heard it i could kneel to and swear to be faithful
show me dear christ thy spouse so bright and clear what is it she which on the other shore goes richly painted or which robb 'd and tore laments and mourns in germany and here sleeps she a thousand then peeps up one year is she self-truth and errs now new now outwore doth she and did she and shall she evermore on one on seven or on no hill appear dwells she with us or like adventuring knights first travel we to seek and then make love betray kind husband thy spouse to our sights and let mine amorous soul court thy mild dove who is most true and pleasing to thee then when she'is embrac 'd and open to most men

sometimes she is a child within mine arms cowering beneath dark wings that love must chase — with still tears showering and averted face inexplicably fill 'd with faint alarms and oft from mine own spirit 's hurtling harms i crave the refuge of her deep embrace — against all ills the fortified strong place and sweet reserve of sovereign counter-charms and love our light at night and shade at noon lulls us to rest with songs and turns away all shafts of shelterless tumultuous day like the moon 's growth his face gleams through his tune and as soft waters warble to the moon our answering spirits chime one roundelay
like labour-laden moonclouds faint to flee from winds that sweep the winter-bitten wold — like multiform circumfluence manifold of night 's flood-tide —like terrors that agree of hoarse-tongued fire and inarticulate sea — even such within some glass dimm 'd by our breath our hearts discern wild images of death shadows and shoals that edge eternity howbeit athwart death 's imminent shade doth soar one power than flow of stream or flight of dove sweeter to glide around to brood above tell me my heart —what angel-greeted door or threshold of wing-winnow 'd threshing-floor hath guest fire-fledg 'd as thine whose lord is love

i dreamed that i was old in stale declension fallen from my prime when company was mine cat-nimbleness and green invention before time took my leafy hours away my wisdom ripe with body ’ s ruin found itself tart recompense for what was lost in false exchange since wisdom in the ground has no apocalypse or pentecost i wept for my youth sweet passionate young thought and cozy women dead that by my side once lay i wept with bitter longing not remembering how in my youth i cried

i hid my love when young till i could n't bear the buzzing of a fly i hid my love to my despite till i could not bear to look at light i dare not gaze upon her face but left her memory in each place where'er i saw a wild flower lie i kissed and bade my love good-bye i met her in the greenest dells where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells the lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye the bee kissed and went singing by a sunbeam found a passage there a gold chain round her neck so fair as secret as the wild bee 's song she lay there all the summer long i hid my love in field and town till e'en the breeze would knock me down the bees seemed singing ballads o'er the fly 's bass turned a lion 's roar and even silence found a tongue to haunt me all the summer long the riddle nature could not prove was nothing else but secret love
i saw in louisiana a live-oak growing all alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green and its look rude unbending lusty made me think of myself but i wonder ’ d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near for i knew i could not and i broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and twined around it a little moss and brought it away and i have placed it in sight in my room it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends for i believe lately i think of little else than of them yet it remains to me a curious token it makes me think of manly love for all that and though the live-oak glistens there in louisiana solitary in a wide flat space uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near i know very well i could not

hips and wrists it is in his walk the carriage of his neck the flex of his waist and knees dress does not hide him the strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth to see him

dagonet the fool whom gawain in his mood had made mock-knight of arthur 's table round at camelot high above the yellowing woods danced like a wither 'd leaf before the hall and toward him from the hall with harp in hand and from the crown thereof a carcanet of ruby swaying to and fro the prize of tristram in the jousts of yesterday came tristram saying `` why skip ye so sir fool '' for arthur and sir lancelot riding once far down beneath a winding wall of rock heard a child wail a stump of oak half-dead from roots like some black coil of carven snakes clutch 'd at the crag and started thro mid air bearing an eagle 's nest and thro the tree rush 'd ever a rainy wind and thro the wind pierced ever a child 's cry and crag and tree scaling sir lancelot from the perilous nest this ruby necklace thrice around her neck and all unscarr 'd from beak or talon brought a maiden babe which arthur pitying took then gave it to his queen to rear the queen but coldly acquiescing in her white arms received and after loved it tenderly and named it nestling so forgot herself a moment and her cares till that young life being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold past from her and in time the carcanet vext her with plaintive memories of the child so she delivering it to arthur said '' take thou the jewels of this dead innocence and make them an thou wilt a tourney-prize '' to whom the king `` peace to thine eagle-borne dead nestling and this honour after death following thy will but o my queen i muse why ye not wear on arm or neck or zone those diamonds that i rescued from the tarn and lancelot won methought for thee to wear '' `` would rather you had let them fall '' she cried '' plunge and be lost—ill-fated as they were a bitterness to me —ye look amazed not knowing they were lost as soon as given— slid from my hands when i was leaning out above the river—that unhappy child past in her barge but rosier luck will go with these rich jewels seeing that they came not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer but the sweet body of a maiden babe perchance—who knows —the purest of thy knights may win them for the purest of my maids '' she ended and the cry of a great jousts with trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways from camelot in among the faded fields to furthest towers and everywhere the knights arm 'd for a day of glory before the king but on the hither side of that loud morn into the hall stagger 'd his visage ribb'd from ear to ear with dogwhip-weals his nose bridge-broken one eye out and one hand off and one with shatter 'd fingers dangling lame a churl to whom indignantly the king `` my churl for whom christ died what evil beast hath drawn his claws athwart thy face or fiend man was it who marr 'd heaven 's image in thee thus '' then sputtering thro the hedge of splinter 'd teeth yet strangers to the tongue and with blunt stump pitch-blacken 'd sawing the air said the maim 'd churl `` he took them and he drave them to his tower— some hold he was a table-knight of thine— a hundred goodly ones—the red knight he— lord i was tending swine and the red knight brake in upon me and drave them to his tower and when i call 'd upon thy name as one that doest right by gentle and by churl maim 'd me and maul 'd and would outright have slain save that he sware me to a message saying 'tell thou the king and all his liars that i have founded my round table in the north and whatsoever his own knights have sworn my knights have sworn the counter to it—and say my tower is full of harlots like his court but mine are worthier seeing they profess to be none other than themselves—and say my knights are all adulterers like his own but mine are truer seeing they profess to be none other and say his hour is come the heathen are upon him his long lance broken and his excalibur a straw `` then arthur turn 'd to kay the seneschal '' take thou my churl and tend him curiously like a king 's heir till all his hurts be whole the heathen—but that ever-climbing wave hurl 'd back again so often in empty foam hath lain for years at rest—and renegades thieves bandits leavings of confusion whom the wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere friends thro your manhood and your fealty —now make their last head like satan in the north my younger knights new-made in whom your flower waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds move with me toward their quelling which achieved the loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore but thou sir lancelot sitting in my place enchair 'd to-morrow arbitrate the field for wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it only to yield my queen her own again speak lancelot thou art silent is it well '' thereto sir lancelot answer 'd `` it is well yet better if the king abide and leave the leading of his younger knights to me else for the king has will 'd it it is well '' then arthur rose and lancelot follow 'd him and while they stood without the doors the king turn 'd to him saying `` is it then so well or mine the blame that oft i seem as he of whom was written 'a sound is in his ears the foot that loiters bidden go —the glance that only seems half-loyal to command — a manner somewhat fall'n from reverence— or have i dream 'd the bearing of our knights tells of a manhood ever less and lower or whence the fear lest this my realm uprear 'd by noble deeds at one with noble vows from flat confusion and brute violences reel back into the beast and be no more '' he spoke and taking all his younger knights down the slope city rode and sharply turn'd north by the gate in her high bower the queen working a tapestry lifted up her head watch 'd her lord pass and knew not that she sigh 'd then ran across her memory the strange rhyme of bygone merlin `` where is he who knows from the great deep to the great deep he goes '' but when the morning of a tournament by these in earnest those in mockery call'd the tournament of the dead innocence brake with a wet wind blowing lancelot round whose sick head all night like birds of prey the words of arthur flying shriek 'd arose and down a streetway hung with folds of pure white samite and by fountains running wine where children sat in white with cups of gold moved to the lists and there with slow sad steps ascending fill 'd his double-dragon 'd chair he glanced and saw the stately galleries dame damsel each thro worship of their queen white-robed in honour of the stainless child and some with scatter 'd jewels like a bank of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire he look 'd but once and vail 'd his eyes again the sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream to ears but half-awaked then one low roll of autumn thunder and the jousts began and ever the wind blew and yellowing leaf and gloom and gleam and shower and shorn plume went down it sighing weariedly as one who sits and gazes on a faded fire when all the goodlier guests are past away sat their great umpire looking o'er the lists he saw the laws that ruled the tournament broken but spake not once a knight cast down before his throne of arbitration cursed the dead babe and the follies of the king and once the laces of a helmet crack 'd and show 'd him like a vermin in its hole modred a narrow face anon he heard the voice that billow 'd round the barriers roar an ocean-sounding welcome to one knight but newly-enter 'd taller than the rest and armour 'd all in forest green whereon there tript a hundred tiny silver deer and wearing but a holly-spray for crest with ever-scattering berries and on shield a spear a harp a bugle—tristram—late from overseas in brittany return 'd and marriage with a princess of that realm isolt the white—sir tristram of the woods— whom lancelot knew had held sometime with pain his own against him and now yearn 'd to shake the burthen off his heart in one full shock with tristram ev'n to death his strong hands gript and dinted the gilt dragons right and left until he groan 'd for wrath—so many of those that ware their ladies colours on the casque drew from before sir tristram to the bounds and there with gibes and flickering mockeries stood while he mutter 'd `` craven crests o shame what faith have these in whom they sware to love the glory of our round table is no more '' so tristram won and lancelot gave the gems not speaking other word than `` hast thou won art thou the purest brother see the hand wherewith thou takest this is red '' to whom tristram half plagued by lancelot 's languorous mood made answer `` ay but wherefore toss me this like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound let be thy fair queen 's fantasy strength of heart and might of limb but mainly use and skill are winners in this pastime of our king my hand—belike the lance hath dript upon it— no blood of mine i trow but o chief knight right arm of arthur in the battlefield great brother thou nor i have made the world be happy in thy fair queen as i in mine '' and tristram round the gallery made his horse caracole then bow 'd his homage bluntly saying '' fair damsels each to him who worships each sole queen of beauty and of love behold this day my queen of beauty is not here '' and most of these were mute some anger 'd one murmuring `` all courtesy is dead '' and one '' the glory of our round table is no more '' then fell thick rain plume droopt and mantle clung and pettish cries awoke and the wan day went glooming down in wet and weariness but under her black brows a swarthy one laugh 'd shrilly crying `` praise the patient saints our one white day of innocence hath past tho somewhat draggled at the skirt so be it the snowdrop only flowering thro the year would make the world as blank as winter-tide come—let us gladden their sad eyes our queen's and lancelot 's at this night 's solemnity with all the kindlier colours of the field '' so dame and damsel glitter 'd at the feast variously gay for he that tells the tale liken 'd them saying as when an hour of cold falls on the mountain in midsummer snows and all the purple slopes of mountain flowers pass under white till the warm hour returns with veer of wind and all are flowers again so dame and damsel cast the simple white and glowing in all colours the live grass rose-campion bluebell kingcup poppy glanced about the revels and with mirth so loud beyond all use that half-amazed the queen and wroth at tristram and the lawless jousts brake up their sports then slowly to her bower parted and in her bosom pain was lord and little dagonet on the morrow morn high over all the yellowing autumn-tide danced like a wither 'd leaf before the hall then tristram saying `` why skip ye so sir fool '' wheel 'd round on either heel dagonet replied '' belike for lack of wiser company or being fool and seeing too much wit makes the world rotten why belike i skip to know myself the wisest knight of all '' `` ay fool '' said tristram `` but 't is eating dry to dance without a catch a roundelay to dance to '' then he twangled on his harp and while he twangled little dagonet stood quiet as any water-sodden log stay 'd in the wandering warble of a brook but when the twangling ended skipt again and being ask 'd `` why skipt ye not sir fool '' made answer `` i had liefer twenty years skip to the broken music of my brains than any broken music thou canst make '' then tristram waiting for the quip to come '' good now what music have i broken fool '' and little dagonet skipping `` arthur the king 's for when thou playest that air with queen isolt thou makest broken music with thy bride her daintier namesake down in brittany— and so thou breakest arthur 's music too '' `` save for that broken music in thy brains sir fool '' said tristram `` i would break thy head fool i came late the heathen wars were o'er the life had flown we sware but by the shell— i am but a fool to reason with a fool— come thou art crabb 'd and sour but lean me down sir dagonet one of thy long asses ears and harken if my music be not true `` 'free love—free field—we love but while we may the woods are hush 'd their music is no more the leaf is dead the yearning past away new leaf new life—the days of frost are o'er new life new love to suit the newer day new loves are sweet as those that went before free love—free field—we love but while we may `` ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune not stood stockstill i made it in the woods and heard it ring as true as tested gold '' but dagonet with one foot poised in his hand '' friend did ye mark that fountain yesterday made to run wine —but this had run itself all out like a long life to a sour end— and them that round it sat with golden cups to hand the wine to whosoever came— the twelve small damosels white as innocence in honour of poor innocence the babe who left the gems which innocence the queen lent to the king and innocence the king gave for a prize—and one of those white slips handed her cup and piped the pretty one 'drink drink sir fool and thereupon i drank spat—pish—the cup was gold the draught was mud '' and tristram `` was it muddier than thy gibes is all the laughter gone dead out of thee — not marking how the knighthood mock thee fool— 'fear god honour the king—his one true knight— sole follower of the vows'—for here be they who knew thee swine enow before i came smuttier than blasted grain but when the king had made thee fool thy vanity so shot up it frighted all free fool from out thy heart which left thee less than fool and less than swine a naked aught—yet swine i hold thee still for i have flung thee pearls and find thee swine '' and little dagonet mincing with his feet '' knight an ye fling those rubies round my neck in lieu of hers i 'll hold thou hast some touch of music since i care not for thy pearls swine i have wallow 'd i have wash'd—the world is flesh and shadow—i have had my day the dirty nurse experience in her kind hath foul 'd me—an i wallow 'd then i wash'd— i have had my day and my philosophies— and thank the lord i am king arthur 's fool swine say ye swine goats asses rams and geese troop 'd round a paynim harper once who thrumm'd on such a wire as musically as thou some such fine song—but never a king 's fool '' and tristram `` then were swine goats asses geese the wiser fools seeing thy paynim bard had such a mastery of his mystery that he could harp his wife up out of hell '' then dagonet turning on the ball of his foot '' and whither harp'st thou thine down and thyself down and two more a helpful harper thou that harpest downward dost thou know the star we call the harp of arthur up in heaven '' and tristram `` ay sir fool for when our king was victor wellnigh day by day the knights glorying in each new glory set his name high on all hills and in the signs of heaven '' and dagonet answer 'd `` ay and when the land was freed and the queen false ye set yourself to babble about him all to show your wit— and whether he were king by courtesy or king by right—and so went harping down the black king 's highway got so far and grew so witty that we play 'd at ducks and drakes with arthur 's vows on the great lake of fire tuwhoo do ye see it do ye see the star '' `` nay fool '' said tristram `` not in open day '' and dagonet `` nay nor will i see it and hear it makes a silent music up in heaven and i and arthur and the angels hear and then we skip '' `` lo fool '' he said `` ye talk fool 's treason is the king thy brother fool '' then little dagonet clapt his hands and shrill 'd '' ay ay my brother fool the king of fools conceits himself as god that he can make figs out of thistles silk from bristles milk from burning spurge honey from hornet-combs and men from beasts—long live the king of fools '' and down the city dagonet danced away but thro the slowly-mellowing avenues and solitary passes of the wood rode tristram toward lyonnesse and the west before him fled the face of queen isolt with ruby-circled neck but evermore past as a rustle or twitter in the wood made dull his inner keen his outer eye for all that walk 'd or crept or perch 'd or flew anon the face as when a gust hath blown unruffling waters re-collect the shape of one that in them sees himself return 'd but at the slot or fewmets of a deer or ev'n a fall'n feather vanish 'd again so on for all that day from lawn to lawn thro many a league-long bower he rode at length a lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs furze-cramm 'd and bracken-rooft the which himself built for a summer day with queen isolt against a shower dark in the golden grove appearing sent his fancy back to where she lived a moon in that low lodge with him till mark her lord had past the cornish king with six or seven when tristram was away and snatch 'd her thence yet dreading worse than shame her warrior tristram spake not any word but bode his hour devising wretchedness and now that desert lodge to tristram lookt so sweet that halting in he past and sank down on a drift of foliage random-blown but could not rest for musing how to smoothe and sleek his marriage over to the queen perchance in lone tintagil far from all the tonguesters of the court she had not heard but then what folly had sent him overseas after she left him lonely here a name was it the name of one in brittany isolt the daughter of the king `` isolt of the white hands '' they call 'd her the sweet name allured him first and then the maid herself who served him well with those white hands of hers and loved him well until himself had thought he loved her also wedded easily but left her all as easily and return 'd the black-blue irish hair and irish eyes had drawn him home—what marvel then he laid his brows upon the drifted leaf and dream 'd he seem 'd to pace the strand of brittany between isolt of britain and his bride and show 'd them both the ruby-chain and both began to struggle for it till his queen graspt it so hard that all her hand was red then cried the breton `` look her hand is red these be no rubies this is frozen blood and melts within her hand—her hand is hot with ill desires but this i gave thee look is all as cool and white as any flower '' follow 'd a rush of eagle 's wings and then a whimpering of the spirit of the child because the twain had spoil 'd her carcanet he dream 'd but arthur with a hundred spears rode far till o'er the illimitable reed and many a glancing plash and sallowy isle the wide-wing 'd sunset of the misty marsh glared on a huge machicolated tower that stood with open doors whereout was roll'd a roar of riot as from men secure amid their marshes ruffians at their ease among their harlot-brides an evil song `` lo there '' said one of arthur 's youth for there high on a grim dead tree before the tower a goodly brother of the table round swung by the neck and on the boughs a shield showing a shower of blood in a field noir and therebeside a horn inflamed the knights at that dishonour done the gilded spur till each would clash the shield and blow the horn but arthur waved them back alone he rode then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn that sent the face of all the marsh aloft an ever upward-rushing storm and cloud of shriek and plume the red knight heard and all even to tipmost lance and topmost helm in blood-red armour sallying howl 'd to the king `` the teeth of hell flay bare and gnash thee flat — lo art thou not that eunuch-hearted king who fain had clipt free manhood from the world— the woman-worshipper yea god 's curse and i slain was the brother of my paramour by a knight of thine and i that heard her whine and snivel being eunuch-hearted too sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell and stings itself to everlasting death to hang whatever knight of thine i fought and tumbled art thou king —look to thy life '' he ended arthur knew the voice the face wellnigh was helmet-hidden and the name went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind and arthur deign 'd not use of word or sword but let the drunkard as he stretch 'd from horse to strike him overbalancing his bulk down from the causeway heavily to the swamp fall as the crest of some slow-arching wave heard in dead night along that table-shore drops flat and after the great waters break whitening for half a league and thin themselves far over sands marbled with moon and cloud from less and less to nothing thus he fell head-heavy then the knights who watch 'd him roar'd and shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n there trampled out his face from being known and sank his head in mire and slimed themselves nor heard the king for their own cries but sprang thro open doors and swording right and left men women on their sodden faces hurl'd the tables over and the wines and slew till all the rafters rang with woman-yells and all the pavement stream 'd with massacre then echoing yell with yell they fired the tower which half that autumn night like the live north red-pulsing up thro alioth and alcor made all above it and a hundred meres about it as the water moab saw come round by the east and out beyond them flush'd the long low dune and lazy-plunging sea so all the ways were safe from shore to shore but in the heart of arthur pain was lord then out of tristram waking the red dream fled with a shout and that low lodge return 'd mid-forest and the wind among the boughs he whistled his good warhorse left to graze among the forest greens vaulted upon him and rode beneath an ever-showering leaf till one lone woman weeping near a cross stay 'd him `` why weep ye '' `` lord '' she said `` my man hath left me or is dead '' whereon he thought— '' what if she hate me now i would not this what if she love me still i would not that i know not what i would '' —but said to her '' yet weep not thou lest if thy mate return he find thy favour changed and love thee not '' — then pressing day by day thro lyonnesse last in a roky hollow belling heard the hounds of mark and felt the goodly hounds yelp at his heart but turning past and gain'd tintagil half in sea and high on land a crown of towers down in a casement sat a low sea-sunset glorying round her hair and glossy-throated grace isolt the queen and when she heard the feet of tristram grind the spiring stone that scaled about her tower flush 'd started met him at the doors and there belted his body with her white embrace crying aloud `` not mark—not mark my soul the footstep flutter 'd me at first not he catlike thro his own castle steals my mark but warrior-wise thou stridest thro his halls who hates thee as i him—ev'n to the death my soul i felt my hatred for my mark quicken within me and knew that thou wert nigh '' to whom sir tristram smiling `` i am here let be thy mark seeing he is not thine '' and drawing somewhat backward she replied '' can he be wrong 'd who is not ev'n his own but save for dread of thee had beaten me scratch 'd bitten blinded marr 'd me somehow—mark what rights are his that dare not strike for them not lift a hand—not tho he found me thus but harken have ye met him hence he went to-day for three days hunting—as he said— and so returns belike within an hour mark 's way my soul —but eat not thou with mark because he hates thee even more than fears nor drink and when thou passest any wood close vizor lest an arrow from the bush should leave me all alone with mark and hell my god the measure of my hate for mark is as the measure of my love for thee '' so pluck 'd one way by hate and one by love drain 'd of her force again she sat and spake to tristram as he knelt before her saying '' o hunter and o blower of the horn harper and thou hast been a rover too for ere i mated with my shambling king ye twain had fallen out about the bride of one—his name is out of me—the prize if prize she were— what marvel—she could see — thine friend and ever since my craven seeks to wreck thee villainously but o sir knight what dame or damsel have ye kneel 'd to last '' and tristram `` last to my queen paramount here now to my queen paramount of love and loveliness—ay lovelier than when first her light feet fell on our rough lyonnesse sailing from ireland '' softly laugh 'd isolt '' flatter me not for hath not our great queen my dole of beauty trebled '' and he said '' her beauty is her beauty and thine thine and thine is more to me—soft gracious kind— save when thy mark is kindled on thy lips most gracious but she haughty ev'n to him lancelot for i have seen him wan enow to make one doubt if ever the great queen have yielded him her love '' to whom isolt '' ah then false hunter and false harper thou who brakest thro the scruple of my bond calling me thy white hind and saying to me that guinevere had sinn 'd against the highest and i—misyoked with such a want of man— that i could hardly sin against the lowest '' he answer 'd `` o my soul be comforted if this be sweet to sin in leading-strings if here be comfort and if ours be sin crown 'd warrant had we for the crowning sin that made us happy but how ye greet me—fear and fault and doubt—no word of that fond tale— thy deep heart-yearnings thy sweet memories of tristram in that year he was away '' and saddening on the sudden spake isolt '' i had forgotten all in my strong joy to see thee—yearnings —ay for hour by hour here in the never-ended afternoon o sweeter than all memories of thee deeper than any yearnings after thee seem 'd those far-rolling westward-smiling seas watch 'd from this tower isolt of britain dash'd before isolt of brittany on the strand would that have chill 'd her bride-kiss wedded her fought in her father 's battles wounded there the king was all fulfill 'd with gratefulness and she my namesake of the hands that heal'd thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress— well—can i wish her any huger wrong than having known thee her too hast thou left to pine and waste in those sweet memories o were i not my mark 's by whom all men are noble i should hate thee more than love '' and tristram fondling her light hands replied '' grace queen for being loved she loved me well did i love her the name at least i loved isolt —i fought his battles for isolt the night was dark the true star set isolt the name was ruler of the dark—isolt care not for her patient and prayerful meek pale-blooded she will yield herself to god '' and isolt answer 'd `` yea and why not i mine is the larger need who am not meek pale-blooded prayerful let me tell thee now here one black mute midsummer night i sat lonely but musing on thee wondering where murmuring a light song i had heard thee sing and once or twice i spake thy name aloud then flash 'd a levin-brand and near me stood in fuming sulphur blue and green a fiend— mark 's way to steal behind one in the dark— for there was mark 'he has wedded her he said not said but hiss 'd it then this crown of towers so shook to such a roar of all the sky that here in utter dark i swoon 'd away and woke again in utter dark and cried 'i will flee hence and give myself to god'— and thou wert lying in thy new leman 's arms '' then tristram ever dallying with her hand '' may god be with thee sweet when old and gray and past desire '' a saying that anger 'd her `` 'may god be with thee sweet when thou art old and sweet no more to me i need him now for when had lancelot utter 'd aught so gross ev'n to the swineherd 's malkin in the mast the greater man the greater courtesy far other was the tristram arthur 's knight but thou thro ever harrying thy wild beasts— save that to touch a harp tilt with a lance becomes thee well—art grown wild beast thyself how darest thou if lover push me even in fancy from thy side and set me far in the gray distance half a life away her to be loved no more unsay it unswear flatter me rather seeing me so weak broken with mark and hate and solitude thy marriage and mine own that i should suck lies like sweet wines lie to me i believe will ye not lie not swear as there ye kneel and solemnly as when ye sware to him the man of men our king—my god the power was once in vows when men believed the king they lied not then who sware and thro their vows the king prevailing made his realm —i say swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old gray-hair 'd and past desire and in despair '' then tristram pacing moodily up and down '' vows did you keep the vow you made to mark more than i mine lied say ye nay but learnt the vow that binds too strictly snaps itself— my knighthood taught me this—ay being snapt— we run more counter to the soul thereof than had we never sworn i swear no more i swore to the great king and am forsworn for once—ev'n to the height—i honour 'd him 'man is he man at all methought when first i rode from our rough lyonnesse and beheld that victor of the pagan throned in hall— his hair a sun that ray 'd from off a brow like hillsnow high in heaven the steel-blue eyes the golden beard that clothed his lips with light— moreover that weird legend of his birth with merlin 's mystic babble about his end amazed me then his foot was on a stool shaped as a dragon he seem 'd to me no man but michaël trampling satan so i sware being amazed but this went by—the vows o ay—the wholesome madness of an hour— they served their use their time for every knight believed himself a greater than himself and every follower eyed him as a god till he being lifted up beyond himself did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done and so the realm was made but then their vows— first mainly thro that sullying of our queen— began to gall the knighthood asking whence had arthur right to bind them to himself dropt down from heaven wash 'd up from out the deep they fail 'd to trace him thro the flesh and blood of our old kings whence then a doubtful lord to bind them by inviolable vows which flesh and blood perforce would violate for feel this arm of mine—the tide within red with free chase and heather-scented air pulsing full man can arthur make me pure as any maiden child lock up my tongue from uttering freely what i freely hear bind me to one the wide world laughs at it and worldling of the world am i and know the ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour woos his own end we are not angels here nor shall be vows—i am woodman of the woods and hear the garnet-headed yaffingale mock them my soul we love but while we may and therefore is my love so large for thee seeing it is not bounded save by love '' here ending he moved toward her and she said '' good an i turn 'd away my love for thee to some one thrice as courteous as thyself— for courtesy wins woman all as well as valour may but he that closes both is perfect he is lancelot—taller indeed rosier and comelier thou—but say i loved this knightliest of all knights and cast thee back thine own small saw 'we love but while we may well then what answer '' he that while she spake mindful of what he brought to adorn her with the jewels had let one finger lightly touch the warm white apple of her throat replied '' press this a little closer sweet until— come i am hunger 'd and half-anger'd—meat wine wine—and i will love thee to the death and out beyond into the dream to come '' so then when both were brought to full accord she rose and set before him all he will 'd and after these had comforted the blood with meats and wines and satiated their hearts— now talking of their woodland paradise the deer the dews the fern the founts the lawns now mocking at the much ungainliness and craven shifts and long crane legs of mark— then tristram laughing caught the harp and sang `` ay ay o ay—the winds that bend the brier a star in heaven a star within the mere ay ay o ay—a star was my desire and one was far apart and one was near ay ay o ay—the winds that bow the grass and one was water and one star was fire and one will ever shine and one will pass ay ay o ay—the winds that move the mere '' then in the light 's last glimmer tristram show'd and swung the ruby carcanet she cried '' the collar of some order which our king hath newly founded all for thee my soul for thee to yield thee grace beyond thy peers '' `` not so my queen '' he said `` but the red fruit grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven and won by tristram as a tourney-prize and hither brought by tristram for his last love-offering and peace-offering unto thee '' he spoke he turn 'd then flinging round her neck claspt it and cried `` thine order o my queen '' but while he bow 'd to kiss the jewell 'd throat out of the dark just as the lips had touch 'd behind him rose a shadow and a shriek— '' mark 's way '' said mark and clove him thro the brain that night came arthur home and while he climb 'd all in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom the stairway to the hall and look 'd and saw the great queen 's bower was dark —about his feet a voice clung sobbing till he question 'd it '' what art thou '' and the voice about his feet sent up an answer sobbing `` i am thy fool and i shall never make thee smile again ''
“ i have heard but not believed the spirits of the dead may walk again. ” winter ’ s tale if spirits walk love when the night climbs slow the slant footpath where we were wont to go be sure that i shall take the self-same way to the hill-crest and shoreward down the gray sheer gravelled slope where vetches straggling grow look for me not when gusts of winter blow when at thy pane beat hands of sleet and snow i would not come thy dear eyes to affray if spirits walk but when in june the pines are whispering low and when their breath plays with thy bright hair so as some one 's fingers once were used to play— that hour when birds leave song and children pray keep the old tryst sweetheart and thou shalt know if spirits walk

you have not conquered me—it is the surge of love itself that beats against my will it is the sting of conflict the old urge that calls me still it is not you i love—it is the form and shadow of all lovers who have died that gives you all the freshness of a warm and unfamiliar bride it is your name i breathe your hands i seek it will be you when you are gone and yet the dream the name i never speak is that that lures me on it is the golden summons the bright wave of banners calling me anew it is all beauty perilous and grave— it is not you
know celia since thou art so proud 'twas i that gave thee thy renown thou hadst in the forgotten crowd of common beauties liv 'd unknown had not my verse exhal 'd thy name and with it imp 'd the wings of fame that killing power is none of thine i gave it to thy voice and eyes thy sweets thy graces all are mine thou art my star shin'st in my skies then dart not from thy borrow 'd sphere lightning on him that fix 'd thee there tempt me with such affrights no more lest what i made i uncreate let fools thy mystic forms adore i 'll know thee in thy mortal state wise poets that wrapp 'd truth in tales knew her themselves through all her veils
thin are the night-skirts left behind by daybreak hours that onward creep and thin alas the shred of sleep that wavers with the spirit 's wind but in half-dreams that shift and roll and still remember and forget my soul this hour has drawn your soul a little nearer yet our lives most dear are never near our thoughts are never far apart though all that draws us heart to heart seems fainter now and now more clear to-night love claims his full control and with desire and with regret my soul this hour has drawn your soul a little nearer yet is there a home where heavy earth melts to bright air that breathes no pain where water leaves no thirst again and springing fire is love 's new birth if faith long bound to one true goal may there at length its hope beget my soul that hour shall draw your soul for ever nearer yet
you ever wake up with your footie pjs warming your neck like a noose ever upchuck after a home-cooked meal or notice how the blood on the bottoms of your feet just won ’ t seem to go away love it used to be you could retire your toothbrush for like two or three days and still i ’ d push my downy face into your neck used to be i hung on your every word sing you ’ d say and i was a bird freedom you ’ d say and i never really knew what that meant but liked the way it rang like a rusty bell used to be but now i can tell you your breath stinks and you ’ re full of shit you have more lies about yourself than bodies beneath your bed rooting for the underdog team player hook line and sinker love you helped design the brick that built the walls around the castle in the basement of which is a vault inside of which is another vault inside of which you get my point your tongue is made of honey but flicks like a snake ’ s voice like a bird but everyone ’ s ears are bleeding from the inside your house shines and shines but from outside you can see it ’ s built from bones from out here it looks like a graveyard and the garden ’ s all ash and besides your breath stinks we ’ re through
first snow—i release her into it— i know released she wo n't come back this is different from letting what already we count as lost go it is nothing like that also it is not like wanting to learn what losing a thing we love feels like oh yes i love her released she seems for a moment as if some part of me that almost i would n't mind understanding better is that not love she seems a part of me and then she seems entirely like what she is a white dog less white suddenly against the snow who wo n't come back i know that and knowing it i release her it 's as if i release her because i know

we were apart yet day by day i bade my heart more constant be i bade it keep the world away and grow a home for only thee nor fear 'd but thy love likewise grew like mine each day more tried more true the fault was grave i might have known what far too soon alas i learn'd— the heart can bind itself alone and faith may oft be unreturn 'd self-sway 'd our feelings ebb and swell— thou lov'st no more —farewell farewell farewell —and thou thou lonely heart which never yet without remorse even for a moment didst depart from thy remote and spher e d course to haunt the place where passions reign— back to thy solitude again back with the conscious thrill of shame which luna felt that summer-night flash through her pure immortal frame when she forsook the starry height to hang over endymion 's sleep upon the pine-grown latmian steep yet she chaste queen had never proved how vain a thing is mortal love wandering in heaven far removed but thou hast long had place to prove this truth—to prove and make thine own '' thou hast been shalt be art alone '' or if not quite alone yet they which touch thee are unmating things— ocean and clouds and night and day lorn autumns and triumphant springs and life and others joy and pain and love if love of happier men of happier men—for they at least have dream 'd two human hearts might blend in one and were through faith released from isolation without end prolong 'd nor knew although not less alone than thou their loneliness

it should have a woman 's name something to tell us how the green skirt of land has bound its hips when the day lowers its vermilion tapestry over the west ridge the water has the sound of leaves shaken in a sack and the child 's voice that you have heard below sings of the sea by slow movements of the earth 's crust or is it that her hip bones have been shaped by a fault of engineering some coquetry cycles this blue edge a spring ready to come forth to correct love 's mathematics saturday rises immaculately the water 's jade edge plays against corn-colored picnic baskets rose and lemon bottles red balloons dancers in purple tights a roan mare out of its field it is not the moment to think of bahia and the gray mother with her water explanation not far from here the city a mass of swift water in its own depression licks its sores still i would be eased by reasons sand dunes in drifts lava cuts its own bed at a mountain base blindness enters where the light refuses to go in loch lomond the water flowers with algae and a small life has taken the name of a star you will hear my star-slow heart empty itself with a light-swift pitch where the water thins to a silence and the woman who will not be named screams in the birth of her fading away

there were distinctive dips and shivers in the various foliage syncopated almost cadenced in the way that once made him invent “ understanding. ” now the boss could say “ parameters ” and mean something like “ i ’ ll pinch. ” by repeating the gesture exactly the woman awakened an excited suspicion in the infant when he awakened she was just returning from one of her little trips it ’ s common to confuse the distance with flirtation that expectant solemnity which seems to invite a kiss he stroked her carapace with his claw they had developed a code in which each word appeared to refer to some abdicated function thus in a department store petite impressions might neighbor town square but he exaggerated it by mincing words like “ micturition ” setting scenes in which the dainty lover would pretend to leave was it sadness or fear he still wasn ’ t back the act of identification she recognized was always a pleasure but this lasting difference between sense and recognition made her unhappy or afraid once she was rewarded by the beams of headlights flitting in play

in the clear light that confuses everything only you dark laurel shadow my house lifting your arms in the anguish of nature at the stake and at night quivering with tears you are like the tree called tasso ’ s crippled and hooped with iron it stands on peter ’ s hill when the lovers prop their bicycles and sit on the high benches that look across to eternity that tree makes their own torsion seem natural and so they ’ re comforted 2 one of the local philosophers ... he says “ in california we have the old anarchist tradition. ” what can he mean is there an anarchist tradition and why would an anarchist want one o california is there a tree without opinions come let me clasp you let me feel the idea breathing i too cry o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts— “ the sayling pine the cedar proud and tall. ” like the girls in our neighborhood they ’ re beautiful and silent 3 as i was digging in the back yard i thought of a man in china a lifetime it seemed we gazed at each other i could see and hear his heartbeats like a spade hurling clods he pointed behind him and i saw that the hills were covered with armed men and they were all on the other side of the life that i held dear he said “ we are as various as the twigs of a tree but now the tree moves as one man it walks and the earth trembles when a race of slaves is leaving. ” 4 i said “ yet all these people will fall down as one man when the entrails of a bomb are breathing when we came down from chosin carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear and all the dead we had to it was a time of forgetfulness like a plucked string it was a river of darkness was it not so on your side when you came to the sea that was covered with ships let us speak to each other let the word rise making dark strokes in the air that bird flies over the heads of the armed men. ” 5 one part of the tree grows outward the other i saw when with a light i explored the cellar—shattering roots they had broken through the wall as though there were something in my rubbish that life would have at last i must be patient with shapes of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles these things are the beginning of things not visible to the naked eye it was so in the time of tobit— the dish glowed when the angel held it it is so that spiritual messengers deliver their meaning

speck wherein the pained blood falters and goes out soft and stung softly — fairer for a fleck but though my lips shut sucking on the place there is no vein at work upon her face her eyelids are so peaceable no doubt deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways lo this is she that was the world 's delight the old grey years were parcels of her might the strewings of the ways wherein she trod were the twain seasons of the day and night lo she was thus when her clear limbs enticed all lips that now grow sad with kissing christ stained with blood fallen from the feet of god the feet and hands whereat our souls were priced alas lord surely thou art great and fair but lo her wonderfully woven hair and thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss but see now lord her mouth is lovelier she is right fair what hath she done to thee nay fair lord christ lift up thine eyes and see had now thy mother such a lip — like this thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me inside the horsel here the air is hot right little peace one hath for it god wot the scented dusty daylight burns the air and my heart chokes me till i hear it not behold my venus my soul 's body lies with my love laid upon her garment-wise feeling my love in all her limbs and hair and shed between her eyelids through her eyes she holds my heart in her sweet open hands hanging asleep hard by her head there stands crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire love wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands — hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume that shift and steam — loose clots of arid fume from the sea 's panting mouth of dry desire there stands he like one labouring at a loom the warp holds fast across and every thread that makes the woof up has dry specks of red always the shuttle cleaves clean through and he weaves with the hair of many a ruined head love is not glad nor sorry as i deem labouring he dreams and labours in the dream till when the spool is finished lo i see his web reeled off curls and goes out like steam night falls like fire the heavy lights run low and as they drop my blood and body so shake as the flame shakes full of days and hours that sleep not neither weep they as they go ah yet would god this flesh of mine might be where air might wash and long leaves cover me where tides of grass break into foam of flowers or where the wind 's feet shine along the sea ah yet would god that stems and roots were bred out of my weary body and my head that sleep were sealed upon me with a seal and i were as the least of all his dead would god my blood were dew to feed the grass mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass my body broken as a turning wheel and my mouth stricken ere it saith alas ah god that love were as a flower or flame that life were as the naming of a name that death were not more pitiful than desire that these things were not one thing and the same behold now surely somewhere there is death for each man hath some space of years he saith a little space of time ere time expire a little day a little way of breath and lo between the sundawn and the sun his day 's work and his night 's work are undone and lo between the nightfall and the light he is not and none knoweth of such an one ah god that i were as all souls that be as any herb or leaf of any tree as men that toil through hours of labouring night as bones of men under the deep sharp sea outside it must be winter among men for at the gold bars of the gates again i heard all night and all the hours of it the wind 's wet wings and fingers drip with rain knights gather riding sharp for cold i know the ways and woods are strangled with the snow and with short song the maidens spin and sit until christ 's birthnight lily-like arow the scent and shadow shed about me make the very soul in all my senses ache the hot hard night is fed upon my breath and sleep beholds me from afar awake alas but surely where the hills grow deep or where the wild ways of the sea are steep or in strange places somewhere there is death and on death 's face the scattered hair of sleep there lover-like with lips and limbs that meet they lie they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat but me the hot and hungry days devour and in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet no fruit of theirs but fruit of my desire for her love 's sake whose lips through mine respire her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire so lie we not as sleep that lies by death with heavy kisses and with happy breath not as man lies by woman when the bride laughs low for love 's sake and the words he saith for she lies laughing low with love she lies and turns his kisses on her lips to sighs to sighing sound of lips unsatisfied and the sweet tears are tender with her eyes ah not as they but as the souls that were slain in the old time having found her fair who sleeping with her lips upon their eyes heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair their blood runs round the roots of time like rain she casts them forth and gathers them again with nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain her little chambers drip with flower-like red her girdles and the chaplets of her head her armlets and her anklets with her feet she tramples all that winepress of the dead her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires with loves burnt out and unassuaged desires between her lips the steam of them is sweet the languor in her ears of many lyres her beds are full of perfume and sad sound her doors are made with music and barred round with sighing and with laughter and with tears with tears whereby strong souls of men are bound there is the knight adonis that was slain with flesh and blood she chains him for a chain the body and the spirit in her ears cry for her lips divide him vein by vein yea all she slayeth yea every man save me me love thy lover that must cleave to thee till the ending of the days and ways of earth the shaking of the sources of the sea me most forsaken of all souls that fell me satiated with things insatiable me for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth yea laughter kindles at the heart of hell alas thy beauty for thy mouth 's sweet sake my soul is bitter to me my limbs quake as water as the flesh of men that weep as their heart 's vein whose heart goes nigh to break ah god that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips would crush the fruit of death upon my lips ah god that death would tread the grapes of sleep and wring their juice upon me as it drips there is no change of cheer for many days but change of chimes high up in the air that sways rung by the running fingers of the wind and singing sorrows heard on hidden ways day smiteth day in twain night sundereth night and on mine eyes the dark sits as the light yea lord thou knowest i know not having sinned if heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight yea as if earth were sprinkled over me such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea each pore doth yearn and the dried blood thereof gasps by sick fits my heart swims heavily there is a feverish famine in my veins below her bosom where a crushed grape stains the white and blue there my lips caught and clove an hour since and what mark of me remains i dare not always touch her lest the kiss leave my lips charred yea lord a little bliss brief bitter bliss one hath for a great sin nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is sin is it sin whereby men 's souls are thrust into the pit yet had i a good trust to save my soul before it slipped therein trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust for if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath i look between the iron sides of death into sad hell where all sweet love hath end all but the pain that never finisheth there are the naked faces of great kings the singing folk with all their lute-playings there when one cometh he shall have to friend the grave that covets and the worm that clings there sit the knights that were so great of hand the ladies that were queens of fair green land grown grey and black now brought unto the dust soiled without raiment clad about with sand there is one end for all of them they sit naked and sad they drink the dregs of it trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust trampled and trodden by the fiery feet i see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell cities and people whom the gods loved well yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold and for their sakes on her the fire of hell and softer than the egyptian lote-leaf is the queen whose face was worth the world to kiss wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold and large pale lips of strong semiramis curled like a tiger 's that curl back to feed red only where the last kiss made them bleed her hair most thick with many a carven gem deep in the mane great-chested like a steed yea with red sin the faces of them shine but in all these there was no sin like mine no not in all the strange great sins of them that made the wine-press froth and foam with wine for i was of christ 's choosing i god 's knight no blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light i can well see for all the dusty days gone past the clean great time of goodly fight i smell the breathing battle sharp with blows with shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows the fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways sounds and long lights are shed between the rows of beautiful mailed men the edged light slips most like a snake that takes short breath and dips sharp from the beautifully bending head with all its gracious body lithe as lips that curl in touching you right in this wise my sword doth seeming fire in mine own eyes leaving all colours in them brown and red and flecked with death then the keen breaths like sighs the caught-up choked dry laughters following them when all the fighting face is grown a flame for pleasure and the pulse that stuns the ears and the heart 's gladness of the goodly game let me think yet a little i do know these things were sweet but sweet such years ago their savour is all turned now into tears yea ten years since where the blue ripples blow the blue curled eddies of the blowing rhine i felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine touch my blood too and sting me with delight through all this waste and weary body of mine that never feels clear air right gladly then i rode alone a great way off my men and heard the chiming bridle smite and smite and gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again till my song shifted to that iron one seeing there rode up between me and the sun some certain of my foe 's men for his three white wolves across their painted coats did run the first red-bearded with square cheeks — alack i made my knave 's blood turn his beard to black the slaying of him was a joy to see perchance too when at night he came not back some woman fell a-weeping whom this thief would beat when he had drunken yet small grief hath any for the ridding of such knaves yea if one wept i doubt her teen was brief this bitter love is sorrow in all lands draining of eyelids wringing of drenched hands sighing of hearts and filling up of graves a sign across the head of the world he stands an one that hath a plague-mark on his brows dust and spilt blood do track him to his house down under earth sweet smells of lip and cheek like a sweet snake 's breath made more poisonous with chewing of some perfumed deadly grass are shed all round his passage if he pass and their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was as one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds and tracking ever slotwise the warm smell is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds his head far down the hot sweet throat of her — so one tracks love whose breath is deadlier and lo one springe and you are fast in hell fast as the gin 's grip of a wayfarer i think now as the heavy hours decease one after one and bitter thoughts increase one upon one of all sweet finished things the breaking of the battle the long peace wherein we sat clothed softly each man 's hair crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair the sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings and noise of singing in the late sweet air i sang of love too knowing nought thereof '' sweeter '' i said `` the little laugh of love than tears out of the eyes of magdalen or any fallen feather of the dove `` the broken little laugh that spoils a kiss the ache of purple pulses and the bliss of blinded eyelids that expand again — love draws them open with those lips of his '' lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown of one same fire and colour with their own then ere one sleep appeased with sacrifice where his lips wounded there his lips atone '' i sang these things long since and knew them not '' lo here is love or there is love god wot this man and that finds favour in his eyes '' i said `` but i what guerdon have i got `` the dust of praise that is blown everywhere in all men 's faces with the common air the bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet before they wind it in a singer 's hair '' so that one dawn i rode forth sorrowing i had no hope but of some evil thing and so rode slowly past the windy wheat and past the vineyard and the water-spring up to the horsel a great elder-tree held back its heaps of flowers to let me see the ripe tall grass and one that walked therein naked with hair shed over to the knee she walked between the blossom and the grass i knew the beauty of her what she was the beauty of her body and her sin and in my flesh the sin of hers alas alas for sorrow is all the end of this o sad kissed mouth how sorrowful it is o breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings red with the bitter blossom of a kiss ah with blind lips i felt for you and found about my neck your hands and hair enwound the hands that stifle and the hair that stings i felt them fasten sharply without sound yea for my sin i had great store of bliss rise up make answer for me let thy kiss seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is yet i waxed faint with fume of barren bowers and murmuring of the heavy-headed hours and let the dove 's beak fret and peck within my lips in vain and love shed fruitless flowers so that god looked upon me when your hands were hot about me yea god brake my bands to save my soul alive and i came forth like a man blind and naked in strange lands that hears men laugh and weep and knows not whence nor wherefore but is broken in his sense howbeit i met folk riding from the north towards rome to purge them of their souls offence and rode with them and spake to none the day stunned me like lights upon some wizard way and ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight so rode i hearing all these chant and pray and marvelled till before us rose and fell white cursed hills like outer skirts of hell seen where men 's eyes look through the day to night like a jagged shell 's lips harsh untunable blown in between by devils wrangling breath nathless we won well past that hell and death down to the sweet land where all airs are good even unto rome where god 's grace tarrieth then came each man and worshipped at his knees who in the lord god 's likeness bears the keys to bind or loose and called on christ 's shed blood and so the sweet-souled father gave him ease but when i came i fell down at his feet saying `` father though the lord 's blood be right sweet the spot it takes not off the panther 's skin nor shall an ethiop 's stain be bleached with it `` lo i have sinned and have spat out at god wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod more sharp because of mine exceeding sin and all his raiment redder than bright blood '' before mine eyes yea for my sake i wot the heat of hell is waxen seven times hot through my great sin '' then spake he some sweet word giving me cheer which thing availed me not yea scarce i wist if such indeed were said for when i ceased — lo as one newly dead who hears a great cry out of hell i heard the crying of his voice across my head `` until this dry shred staff that hath no whit of leaf nor bark bear blossom and smell sweet seek thou not any mercy in god 's sight for so long shalt thou be cast out from it '' yea what if dried-up stems wax red and green shall that thing be which is not nor has been yea what if sapless bark wax green and white shall any good fruit grow upon my sin nay though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree and though men drew sweet waters of the sea there should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem this waste wan body and shaken soul of me yea though god search it warily enough there is not one sound thing in all thereof though he search all my veins through searching them he shall find nothing whole therein but love for i came home right heavy with small cheer and lo my love mine own soul 's heart more dear than mine own soul more beautiful than god who hath my being between the hands of her — fair still but fair for no man saving me as when she came out of the naked sea making the foam as fire whereon she trod and as the inner flower of fire was she yea she laid hold upon me and her mouth clove unto mine as soul to body doth and laughing made her lips luxurious her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south strange spice and flower strange savour of crushed fruit and perfume the swart kings tread underfoot for pleasure when their minds wax amorous charred frankincense and grated sandal-root and i forgot fear and all weary things all ended prayers and perished thanksgivings feeling her face with all her eager hair cleave to me clinging as a fire that clings to the body and to the raiment burning them as after death i know that such-like flame shall cleave to me for ever yea what care albeit i burn then having felt the same ah love there is no better life than this to have known love how bitter a thing it is and afterward be cast out of god 's sight yea these that know not shall they have such bliss high up in barren heaven before his face as we twain in the heavy-hearted place remembering love and all the dead delight and all that time was sweet with for a space for till the thunder in the trumpet be soul may divide from body but not we one from another i hold thee with my hand i let mine eyes have all their will of thee i seal myself upon thee with my might abiding alway out of all men 's sight until god loosen over sea and land the thunder of the trumpets of the night
from certain sonnets leave me o love which reachest but to dust and thou my mind aspire to higher things grow rich in that which never taketh rust whatever fades but fading pleasure brings draw in thy beams and humble all thy might to that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light that both doth shine and give us sight to see o take fast hold let that light be thy guide in this small course which birth draws out to death and think how evil becometh him to slide who seeketh heav'n and comes of heav'nly breath then farewell world thy uttermost i see eternal love maintain thy life in me
let us go hence my songs she will not hear let us go hence together without fear keep silence now for singing-time is over and over all old things and all things dear she loves not you nor me as all we love her yea though we sang as angels in her ear she would not hear let us rise up and part she will not know let us go seaward as the great winds go full of blown sand and foam what help is here there is no help for all these things are so and all the world is bitter as a tear and how these things are though ye strove to show she would not know let us go home and hence she will not weep we gave love many dreams and days to keep flowers without scent and fruits that would not grow saying 'if thou wilt thrust in thy sickle and reap all is reaped now no grass is left to mow and we that sowed though all we fell on sleep she would not weep let us go hence and rest she will not love she shall not hear us if we sing hereof nor see love 's ways how sore they are and steep come hence let be lie still it is enough love is a barren sea bitter and deep and though she saw all heaven in flower above she would not love let us give up go down she will not care though all the stars made gold of all the air and the sea moving saw before it move one moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair though all those waves went over us and drove deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair she would not care let us go hence go hence she will not see sing all once more together surely she she too remembering days and words that were will turn a little toward us sighing but we we are hence we are gone as though we had not been there nay and though all men seeing had pity on me she would not see
stand still and i will read to thee a lecture love in love 's philosophy these three hours that we have spent walking here two shadows went along with us which we ourselves produc 'd but now the sun is just above our head we do those shadows tread and to brave clearness all things are reduc 'd so whilst our infant loves did grow disguises did and shadows flow from us and our cares but now 't is not so that love has not attain 'd the high'st degree which is still diligent lest others see except our loves at this noon stay we shall new shadows make the other way as the first were made to blind others these which come behind will work upon ourselves and blind our eyes if our loves faint and westwardly decline to me thou falsely thine and i to thee mine actions shall disguise the morning shadows wear away but these grow longer all the day but oh love 's day is short if love decay love is a growing or full constant light and his first minute after noon is night
escape me never— beloved while i am i and you are you so long as the world contains us both me the loving and you the loth while the one eludes must the other pursue my life is a fault at last i fear it seems too much like a fate indeed though i do my best i shall scarce succeed but what if i fail of my purpose here it is but to keep the nerves at strain to dry one 's eyes and laugh at a fall and baffled get up and begin again — so the chase takes up one 's life that 's all while look but once from your farthest bound at me so deep in the dust and dark no sooner the old hope goes to ground than a new one straight to the self-same mark i shape me— ever removed
she left me at the silent time when the moon had ceas 'd to climb the azure path of heaven 's steep and like an albatross asleep balanc 'd on her wings of light hover 'd in the purple night ere she sought her ocean nest in the chambers of the west she left me and i stay 'd alone thinking over every tone which though silent to the ear the enchanted heart could hear like notes which die when born but still haunt the echoes of the hill and feeling ever—oh too much — the soft vibration of her touch as if her gentle hand even now lightly trembled on my brow and thus although she absent were memory gave me all of her that even fancy dares to claim her presence had made weak and tame all passions and i lived alone in the time which is our own the past and future were forgot as they had been and would be not but soon the guardian angel gone the daemon reassum 'd his throne in my faint heart i dare not speak my thoughts but thus disturb 'd and weak i sat and saw the vessels glide over the ocean bright and wide like spirit-winged chariots sent o'er some serenest element for ministrations strange and far as if to some elysian star sailed for drink to medicine such sweet and bitter pain as mine and the wind that wing 'd their flight from the land came fresh and light and the scent of winged flowers and the coolness of the hours of dew and sweet warmth left by day were scatter 'd o'er the twinkling bay and the fisher with his lamp and spear about the low rocks damp crept and struck the fish which came to worship the delusive flame too happy they whose pleasure sought extinguishes all sense and thought of the regret that pleasure leaves destroying life alone not peace
you wept in your mother 's arms and i knew that from then on i was to forget myself listening to your sobs i was resolved against my will to do well by us and so i said without thinking in great panic to do wrong in one 's own judgment though others thrive by it is the right road to blessedness not to submit to error is in itself wrong and pride standing beside you i took an oath to make your life simpler by complicating mine and what i always thought would happen did i was lifted up in joy

the longë love that in my thought doth harbour and in mine hert doth keep his residence into my face presseth with bold pretence and therein campeth spreading his banner she that me learneth to love and suffer and will that my trust and lustës negligence be rayned by reason shame and reverence with his hardiness taketh displeasure wherewithall unto the hert 's forest he fleeth leaving his enterprise with pain and cry and there him hideth and not appeareth what may i do when my master feareth but in the field with him to live and die for good is the life ending faithfully
strephon kissed me in the spring robin in the fall but colin only looked at me and never kissed at all strephon 's kiss was lost in jest robin 's lost in play but the kiss in colin 's eyes haunts me night and day
all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred flame oft in my waking dreams do i live o'er again that happy hour when midway on the mount i lay beside the ruined tower the moonshine stealing o'er the scene had blended with the lights of eve and she was there my hope my joy my own dear genevieve she leant against the arm 'e d man the statue of the arm 'e d knight she stood and listened to my lay amid the lingering light few sorrows hath she of her own my hope my joy my genevieve she loves me best whene'er i sing the songs that make her grieve i played a soft and doleful air i sang an old and moving story— an old rude song that suited well that ruin wild and hoary she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace for well she knew i could not choose but gaze upon her face i told her of the knight that wore upon his shield a burning brand and that for ten long years he wooed the lady of the land i told her how he pined and ah the deep the low the pleading tone with which i sang another 's love interpreted my own she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace and she forgave me that i gazed too fondly on her face but when i told the cruel scorn that crazed that bold and lovely knight and that he crossed the mountain-woods nor rested day nor night that sometimes from the savage den and sometimes from the darksome shade and sometimes starting up at once in green and sunny glade — there came and looked him in the face an angel beautiful and bright and that he knew it was a fiend this miserable knight and that unknowing what he did he leaped amid a murderous band and saved from outrage worse than death the lady of the land and how she wept and clasped his knees and how she tended him in vain— and ever strove to expiate the scorn that crazed his brain — and that she nursed him in a cave and how his madness went away when on the yellow forest-leaves a dying man he lay — his dying words—but when i reached that tenderest strain of all the ditty my faltering voice and pausing harp disturbed her soul with pity all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled my guileless genevieve the music and the doleful tale the rich and balmy eve and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued subdued and cherished long she wept with pity and delight she blushed with love and virgin-shame and like the murmur of a dream i heard her breathe my name her bosom heaved—she stepped aside as conscious of my look she stepped— then suddenly with timorous eye she fled to me and wept she half enclosed me with her arms she pressed me with a meek embrace and bending back her head looked up and gazed upon my face 't was partly love and partly fear and partly 't was a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart i calmed her fears and she was calm and told her love with virgin pride and so i won my genevieve my bright and beauteous bride
where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles miles and miles on the solitary pastures where our sheep half-asleep tinkle homeward thro the twilight stray or stop as they crop— was the site once of a city great and gay so they say of our country 's very capital its prince ages since held his court in gathered councils wielding far peace or war now the country does not even boast a tree as you see to distinguish slopes of verdure certain rills from the hills intersect and give a name to else they run into one where the domed and daring palace shot its spires up like fires o'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall bounding all made of marble men might march on nor be prest twelve abreast and such plenty and perfection see of grass never was such a carpet as this summer-time o'er-spreads and embeds every vestige of the city guessed alone stock or stone— where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe long ago lust of glory pricked their hearts up dread of shame struck them tame and that glory and that shame alike the gold bought and sold now—the single little turret that remains on the plains by the caper overrooted by the gourd overscored while the patching houseleek 's head of blossom winks through the chinks— marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time sprang sublime and a burning ring all round the chariots traced as they raced and the monarch and his minions and his dames viewed the games and i know while thus the quiet-coloured eve smiles to leave to their folding all our many-tinkling fleece in such peace and the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey melt away— that a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair waits me there in the turret whence the charioteers caught soul for the goal when the king looked where she looks now breathless dumb till i come but he looked upon the city every side far and wide all the mountains topped with temples all the glades' colonnades all the causeys bridges aqueducts —and then all the men when i do come she will speak not she will stand either hand on my shoulder give her eyes the first embrace of my face ere we rush ere we extinguish sight and speech each on each in one year they sent a million fighters forth south and north and they built their gods a brazen pillar high as the sky yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force— gold of course o heart oh blood that freezes blood that burns earth 's returns for whole centuries of folly noise and sin shut them in with their triumphs and their glories and the rest love is best
song from abdelazar love in fantastic triumph sat whilst bleeding hearts around him flowed for whom fresh pains he did create and strange tyrannic power he showed from thy bright eyes he took his fire which round about in sport he hurled but ’ twas from mine he took desire enough to undo the amorous world from me he took his sighs and tears from thee his pride and cruelty from me his languishments and fears and every killing dart from thee thus thou and i the god have armed and set him up a deity but my poor heart alone is harmed whilst thine the victor is and free
two hands lie still the hairy and the white and soon down ladders of reflected light the sleepers climb in silence gradually they separate on paths of long ago each winding on his arm the unpleasant clew that leads live as a nerve to memory but often when too steep her dream descends perhaps to the grotto where her father bends to pick her up the husband wakes as though he had forgotten something in the house motionless he eyes the room that glows with the little animals of light that prowl this way and that soft are the beasts of light but softer still her hand that drifts so white upon the whiteness how like a water-plant it floats upon the black canal of sleep suspended upward from the distant deep in pure achievement of its lovely want quietly then he plucks it and it folds and is again a hand small as a child ’ s he would revive it but it barely stirs and so he carries it off a little way and breaks it open gently now he can see the sweetness of the fruit his hand eats hers
immortal heat o let thy greater flame attract the lesser to it let those fires which shall consume the world first make it tame and kindle in our hearts such true desires as may consume our lusts and make thee way then shall our hearts pant thee then shall our brain all her invention on thine altar lay and there in hymns send back thy fire again our eyes shall see thee which before saw dust dust blown by wit till that they both were blind thou shalt recover all thy goods in kind who wert disseized by usurping lust all knees shall bow to thee all wits shall rise and praise him who did make and mend our eyes
highlight actions disable annotations love bade me welcome yet my soul drew back guilty of dust and sin but quick-eyed love observing me grow slack from my first entrance in drew nearer to me sweetly questioning if i lacked any thing a guest i answered worthy to be here love said you shall be he i the unkind ungrateful ah my dear i can not look on thee love took my hand and smiling did reply who made the eyes but i truth lord but i have marred them let my shame go where it doth deserve and know you not says love who bore the blame my dear then i will serve you must sit down says love and taste my meat so i did sit and eat
i room after room i hunt the house through we inhabit together heart fear nothing for heart thou shalt find her— next time herself —not the trouble behind her left in the curtain the couch 's perfume as she brushed it the cornice-wreath blossomed anew yon looking-glass gleamed at the wave of her feather ii yet the day wears and door succeeds door i try the fresh fortune— range the wide house from the wing to the centre still the same chance she goes out as i enter spend my whole day in the quest —who cares but 't is twilight you see —with such suites to explore such closets to search such alcoves to importune
under yonder beech-tree single on the green-sward couched with her arms behind her golden head knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly lies my young love sleeping in the shade had i the heart to slide an arm beneath her press her parting lips as her waist i gather slow waking in amazement she could not but embrace me then would she hold me and never let me go shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow swift as the swallow along the river 's light circleting the surface to meet his mirrored winglets fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine-tops wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun she whom i love is hard to catch and conquer hard but o the glory of the winning were she won when her mother tends her before the laughing mirror tying up her laces looping up her hair often she thinks were this wild thing wedded more love should i have and much less care when her mother tends her before the lighted mirror loosening her laces combing down her curls often she thinks were this wild thing wedded i should miss but one for many boys and girls heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon no she is athirst and drinking up her wonder earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon deals she an unkindness 't is but her rapid measure even as in a dance and her smile can heal no less like the swinging may-cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones off a sunny border she was made to bruise and bless lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping wavy in the dusk lit by one large star lone on the fir-branch his rattle-note unvaried brooding o'er the gloom spins the brown eve-jar darker grows the valley more and more forgetting so were it with me if forgetting could be willed tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well-spring tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled stepping down the hill with her fair companions arm in arm all against the raying west boldly she sings to the merry tune she marches brave in her shape and sweeter unpossessed sweeter for she is what my heart first awaking whispered the world was morning light is she love that so desires would fain keep her changeless fain would fling the net and fain have her free happy happy time when the white star hovers low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew near the face of dawn that draws athwart the darkness threading it with colour as yewberries the yew thicker crowd the shades while the grave east deepens glowing and with crimson a long cloud swells maiden still the morn is and strange she is and secret strange her eyes her cheeks are cold as cold sea-shells sunrays leaning on our southern hills and lighting wild cloud-mountains that drag the hills along oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter chill as a dull face frowning on a song ay but shows the south-west a ripple-feathered bosom blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend scaling the mid-heavens as they stream there comes a sunset rich deep like love in beauty without end when at dawn she sighs and like an infant to the window turns grave eyes craving light released from dreams beautiful she looks like a white water-lily bursting out of bud in havens of the streams when from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle in her long nightgown sweet as boughs of may beautiful she looks like a tall garden lily pure from the night and splendid for the day mother of the dews dark eye-lashed twilight low-lidded twilight o'er the valley 's brim rounding on thy breast sings the dew-delighted skylark clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers let me hear her laughter i would have her ever cool as dew in twilight the lark above the flowers all the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose up lanes woods through they troop in joyful bands my sweet leads she knows not why but now she totters eyes the bent anemones and hangs her hands such a look will tell that the violets are peeping coming the rose and unaware a cry springs in her bosom for odours and for colour covert and the nightingale she knows not why kerchiefed head and chin she darts between her tulips streaming like a willow grey in arrowy rain some bend beaten cheek to gravel and their angel she will be she lifts them and on she speeds again black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway she is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth so when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder saw i once a white dove sole light of earth prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden trained to stand in rows and asking if they please i might love them well but for loving more the wild ones o my wild ones they tell me more than these you my wild one you tell of honied field-rose violet blushing eglantine in life and even as they they by the wayside are earnest of your goodness you are of life 's on the banks that line the way peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three parted is the window she sleeps the starry jasmine breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me sweeter unpossessed have i said of her my sweetest not while she sleeps while she sleeps the jasmine breathes luring her to love she sleeps the starry jasmine bears me to her pillow under white rose-wreaths yellow with birdfoot-trefoil are the grass-glades yellow with cinquefoil of the dew-grey leaf yellow with stonecrop the moss-mounds are yellow blue-necked the wheat sways yellowing to the sheaf green-yellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens thinking of the harvest i look and think of mine this i may know her dressing and undressing such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport shift from cloud to moonlight or edging over thunder slips a ray of sun or sweeping into port white sails furl or on the ocean borders white sails lean along the waves leaping green visions of her shower before me but from eyesight guarded she would be like the sun were she seen front door and back of the mossed old farmhouse open with the morn and in a breezy link freshly sparkles garden to stripe-shadowed orchard green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink busy in the grass the early sun of summer swarms and the blackbird 's mellow fluting notes call my darling up with round and roguish challenge quaintest richest carol of all the singing throats cool was the woodside cool as her white dairy keeping sweet the cream-pan and there the boys from school cricketing below rushed brown and red with sunshine o the dark translucence of the deep-eyed cool spying from the farm herself she fetched a pitcher full of milk and tilted for each in turn the beak then a little fellow mouth up and on tiptoe said `` i will kiss you '' she laughed and leaned her cheek doves of the fir-wood walling high our red roof through the long noon coo crooning through the coo loose droop the leaves and down the sleepy roadway sometimes pipes a chaffinch loose droops the blue cows flap a slow tail knee-deep in the river breathless given up to sun and gnat and fly nowhere is she seen and if i see her nowhere lightning may come straight rains and tiger sky o the golden sheaf the rustling treasure-armful o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced o the treasure-tresses one another over nodding o the girdle slack about the waist slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet quick amid the wheatears wound about the waist gathered see these brides of earth one blush of ripeness o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced large and smoky red the sun 's cold disk drops clipped by naked hills on violet shaded snow eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow nightlong on black print-branches our beech-tree gazes in this whiteness nightlong could i. here may life on death or death on life be painted let me clasp her soul to know she can not die gossips count her faults they scour a narrow chamber where there is no window read not heaven or her `` when she was a tiny '' one aged woman quavers plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear faults she had once as she learnt to run and tumbled faults of feature some see beauty not complete yet good gossips beauty that makes holy earth and air may have faults from head to feet hither she comes she comes to me she lingers deepens her brown eyebrows while in new surprise high rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger yet am i the light and living of her eyes something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming nets her in her blushes and wounds her and tames.— sure of her haven o like a dove alighting arms up she dropped our souls were in our names soon will she lie like a white-frost sunrise yellow oats and brown wheat barley pale as rye long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher felt the girdle loosened seen the tresses fly soon will she lie like a blood-red sunset swift with the to-morrow green-winged spring sing from the south-west bring her back the truants nightingale and swallow song and dipping wing soft new beech-leaves up to beamy april spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain you lucid in the moon raise lilies to the skyfields youngest green transfused in silver shining through fairer than the lily than the wild white cherry fair as in image my seraph love appears borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears could i find a place to be alone with heaven i would speak my heart out heaven is my need every woodland tree is flushing like the dog-wood flashing like the whitebeam swaying like the reed flushing like the dog-wood crimson in october streaming like the flag-reed south-west blown flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted white beam all seem to know what is for heaven alone
snow hurries the strawberries from the bush star-wet water rides you into summer into my autumn your cactus hands are at my heart again lady i court my dream of you in lilies and in rain i vest myself in your oldest memory and in my oldest need and in my passion you are the deepest blue of the oldest rose star circle me an axe i can not cut myself from any of your emblems it will soon be cold here and dark here the grass will lie flat to search for its spring head i will bow again in the winter of your eyes if there is music it will be the weather 's bells to call me to the abandoned chapel of your simple body
between the hands between the brows between the lips of love-lily a spirit is born whose birth endows my blood with fire to burn through me who breathes upon my gazing eyes who laughs and murmurs in mine ear at whose least touch my colour flies and whom my life grows faint to hear within the voice within the heart within the mind of love-lily a spirit is born who lifts apart his tremulous wings and looks at me who on my mouth his finger lays and shows while whispering lutes confer that eden of love 's watered ways whose winds and spirits worship her brows hands and lips heart mind and voice kisses and words of love-lily — oh bid me with your joy rejoice till riotous longing rest in me ah let not hope be still distraught but find in her its gracious goal whose speech truth knows not from her thought nor love her body from her soul
some that have deeper digg 'd love 's mine than i say where his centric happiness doth lie i have lov 'd and got and told but should i love get tell till i were old i should not find that hidden mystery oh 't is imposture all and as no chemic yet th'elixir got but glorifies his pregnant pot if by the way to him befall some odoriferous thing or medicinal so lovers dream a rich and long delight but get a winter-seeming summer 's night our ease our thrift our honour and our day shall we for this vain bubble 's shadow pay ends love in this that my man can be as happy'as i can if he can endure the short scorn of a bridegroom 's play that loving wretch that swears 'tis not the bodies marry but the minds which he in her angelic finds would swear as justly that he hears in that day 's rude hoarse minstrelsy the spheres hope not for mind in women at their best sweetness and wit they'are but mummy possess 'd
like a lone arab old and blind some caravan had left behind who sits beside a ruin 'd well where the shy sand-asps bask and swell and now he hangs his ag 'e d head aslant and listens for a human sound—in vain and now the aid which heaven alone can grant upturns his eyeless face from heaven to gain — even thus in vacant mood one sultry hour resting my eye upon a drooping plant with brow low-bent within my garden-bower i sate upon the couch of camomile and—whether 't was a transient sleep perchance flitted across the idle brain the while i watch 'd the sickly calm with aimless scope in my own heart or that indeed a trance turn 'd my eye inward—thee o genial hope love 's elder sister thee did i behold drest as a bridesmaid but all pale and cold with roseless cheek all pale and cold and dim lie lifeless at my feet and then came love a sylph in bridal trim and stood beside my seat she bent and kiss 'd her sister 's lips as she was wont to do — alas 't was but a chilling breath woke just enough of life in death to make hope die anew
i long to talk with some old lover 's ghost who died before the god of love was born i can not think that he who then lov 'd most sunk so low as to love one which did scorn but since this god produc 'd a destiny and that vice-nature custom lets it be i must love her that loves not me sure they which made him god meant not so much nor he in his young godhead practis 'd it but when an even flame two hearts did touch his office was indulgently to fit actives to passives correspondency only his subject was it can not be love till i love her that loves me but every modern god will now extend his vast prerogative as far as jove to rage to lust to write to to commend all is the purlieu of the god of love o were we waken 'd by this tyranny to ungod this child again it could not be i should love her who loves not me rebel and atheist too why murmur i as though i felt the worst that love could do love might make me leave loving or might try a deeper plague to make her love me too which since she loves before i'am loth to see falsehood is worse than hate and that must be if she whom i love should love me

s ’ io credesse che mia risposta fosse a persona che mai tornasse al mondo questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse ma percioche giammai di questo fondo non torno vivo alcun s ’ i ’ odo il vero senza tema d ’ infamia ti rispondo let us go then you and i when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherized upon a table let us go through certain half-deserted streets the muttering retreats of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells streets that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent to lead you to an overwhelming question ... oh do not ask “ what is it ” let us go and make our visit in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes licked its tongue into the corners of the evening lingered upon the pools that stand in drains let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys slipped by the terrace made a sudden leap and seeing that it was a soft october night curled once about the house and fell asleep and indeed there will be time for the yellow smoke that slides along the street rubbing its back upon the window-panes there will be time there will be time to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet there will be time to murder and create and time for all the works and days of hands that lift and drop a question on your plate time for you and time for me and time yet for a hundred indecisions and for a hundred visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo and indeed there will be time to wonder “ do i dare ” and “ do i dare ” time to turn back and descend the stair with a bald spot in the middle of my hair — they will say “ how his hair is growing thin ” my morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin my necktie rich and modest but asserted by a simple pin — they will say “ but how his arms and legs are thin ” do i dare disturb the universe in a minute there is time for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse for i have known them all already known them all have known the evenings mornings afternoons i have measured out my life with coffee spoons i know the voices dying with a dying fall beneath the music from a farther room so how should i presume and i have known the eyes already known them all— the eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase and when i am formulated sprawling on a pin when i am pinned and wriggling on the wall then how should i begin to spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways and how should i presume and i have known the arms already known them all— arms that are braceleted and white and bare but in the lamplight downed with light brown hair is it perfume from a dress that makes me so digress arms that lie along a table or wrap about a shawl and should i then presume and how should i begin shall i say i have gone at dusk through narrow streets and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes of lonely men in shirt-sleeves leaning out of windows ... i should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas and the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully smoothed by long fingers asleep ... tired ... or it malingers stretched on the floor here beside you and me should i after tea and cakes and ices have the strength to force the moment to its crisis but though i have wept and fasted wept and prayed though i have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter i am no prophet — and here ’ s no great matter i have seen the moment of my greatness flicker and i have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snicker and in short i was afraid and would it have been worth it after all after the cups the marmalade the tea among the porcelain among some talk of you and me would it have been worth while to have bitten off the matter with a smile to have squeezed the universe into a ball to roll it towards some overwhelming question to say “ i am lazarus come from the dead come back to tell you all i shall tell you all ” — if one settling a pillow by her head should say “ that is not what i meant at all that is not it at all. ” and would it have been worth it after all would it have been worth while after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets after the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the floor— and this and so much more — it is impossible to say just what i mean but as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen would it have been worth while if one settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl and turning toward the window should say “ that is not it at all that is not what i meant at all. ” no i am not prince hamlet nor was meant to be am an attendant lord one that will do to swell a progress start a scene or two advise the prince no doubt an easy tool deferential glad to be of use politic cautious and meticulous full of high sentence but a bit obtuse at times indeed almost ridiculous— almost at times the fool i grow old ... i grow old ... i shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled shall i part my hair behind do i dare to eat a peach i shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach i have heard the mermaids singing each to each i do not think that they will sing to me i have seen them riding seaward on the waves combing the white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and black we have lingered in the chambers of the sea by sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown till human voices wake us and we drown

if yet i have not all thy love dear i shall never have it all i can not breathe one other sigh to move nor can intreat one other tear to fall and all my treasure which should purchase thee— sighs tears and oaths and letters—i have spent yet no more can be due to me than at the bargain made was meant if then thy gift of love were partial that some to me some should to others fall dear i shall never have thee all or if then thou gavest me all all was but all which thou hadst then but if in thy heart since there be or shall new love created be by other men which have their stocks entire and can in tears in sighs in oaths and letters outbid me this new love may beget new fears for this love was not vow 'd by thee and yet it was thy gift being general the ground thy heart is mine whatever shall grow there dear i should have it all yet i would not have all yet he that hath all can have no more and since my love doth every day admit new growth thou shouldst have new rewards in store thou canst not every day give me thy heart if thou canst give it then thou never gavest it love 's riddles are that though thy heart depart it stays at home and thou with losing savest it but we will have a way more liberal than changing hearts to join them so we shall be one and one another 's all
magdalen ’ s epistle of love ’ s discrete occasions we observe sufficient catalogue a likely-sounding lexicon pronounced so as to implicate a wealth of difference where reclines instead a common element itself quite like those elements partaken at the table served by jesus on the night he was betrayed—like those in that the bread was breakable the wine was red and wet and met the tongue with bright intoxicating sweetness quite like ... wine none of what i write arrives to compromise that sacrament the mystery of spirit graved in what is commonplace and plain— the broken brittle crust the cup quite otherwise i choose instead to bear again the news that each each was still itself substantial in the simplest sense by now you will have learned of magdalen a name recalled for having won a touch of favor from the one we call the son of man and what you ’ ve heard is true enough i met him first as mute he scribbled in the dust to shame some village hypocrites toward leaving me unbloodied if ill-disposed to taking up again a prior circumstance i met him in the house of one who was a pharisee and not prepared to suffer quietly my handling of the master ’ s feet much later in the garden when having died and risen he spoke as to a maid and asked me why i wept when at any meeting with the christ was i not weeping for what i only speculate —brief inability to speak a weak and giddy troubling near the throat a wash of gratitude and early on i think some slight abiding sense of shame a sop i have inferred more recently to do without lush poverty i think that this is what i ’ m called to say this mild exhortation that one should still abide all love ’ s embarrassments and so resist the new temptation—dangerous inexpedient mask—of shame and well perhaps one other thing i have received some little bit about the glib divisions which so lately have occurred to you as right as necessary fit that the body is something less than honorable say in its ... appetites that the spirit is something pure and—if all goes well— potentially unencumbered by the body ’ s bawdy tastes this disposition then has led to a banal and pious lack of charity and worse has led more than a few to attempt some soul-preserving severance—harsh mortifications manglings all manner of ritual excision lately undertaken to prevent the body ’ s claim upon the heart or mind or blasphemy spirit— whatever name you fix upon the supposéd bodiless i fear that you presume—dissecting the person unto something less complex i think that you forget you are not greek i think that you forget the very issue which induced the christ to take on flesh all loves are bodily require that the lips part and press their trace of secrecy upon the one beloved—the one or many endless array whose aspects turn to face the one who calls the one whose choice it was one day to lift my own bruised body from the dust where it seems to me i must have met my death thereafter this subsequent life and late disinclination toward simple reductions in the name of jesus whose image i work daily to retain i have kissed his feet i have looked long into the trouble of his face and met in that intersection the sacred place—where body and spirit both abide both yield in mutual obsession yes if you ’ ll recall your hebrew word just long enough to glimpse in its dense figure power to produce you ’ ll see as well the damage greek has wrought upon your tongue stolen from your sense of what is holy wholly good fully animal— the body which he now prepares
i went to the dances at chandlerville and played snap-out at winchester one time we changed partners driving home in the moonlight of middle june and then i found davis we were married and lived together for seventy years enjoying working raising the twelve children eight of whom we lost ere i had reached the age of sixty i spun i wove i kept the house i nursed the sick i made the garden and for holiday rambled over the fields where sang the larks and by spoon river gathering many a shell and many a flower and medicinal weed — shouting to the wooded hills singing to the green valleys at ninety-six i had lived enough that is all and passed to a sweet repose what is this i hear of sorrow and weariness anger discontent and drooping hopes degenerate sons and daughters life is too strong for you — it takes life to love life
no eye that sees could fail to remark you like any leaf the rain leaves fixed to and flat against the barn ’ s gray shingle but what leaf this time of year is so pale the pale of leaves when they ’ ve lost just enough green to become the green that means loss and more loss approaching give up the flesh enough times and whatever is lost gets forgotten that was the thought that i woke to those words in my head i rose i did not dress i left no particular body sleeping and stepping into the hour i saw you strange sign at once transparent and impossible to entirely see through and how still the still of being unmoved and then the still of no longer being able to be moved if i think of a heart his as i ’ ve found it ... if i think of increasingly my own ... if i look at you now as from above and see the diva when she is caught in mid- triumph arms half-raised the body as if set at last free of the green sheath that has— how many nights —held her it is not without remembering another i once saw like you except that something a bird some wild and necessary hunger had gotten to it and like the diva but now broken splayed and torn the green torn piecemeal from her i remember the hands and—how small they seemed bringing the small ripped thing to me
an attempt to explain the former changes of the earth 's surface by causes now in operation —subtitle of lyell principles of geology the mountain road ends here broken away in the chasm where the bridge washed out years ago the first scarlet larkspur glitters in the first patch of april morning sunlight the engorged creek roars and rustles like a military ball here by the waterfall insuperable life flushed with the equinox sentient and sentimental falls away to the sea and death the tissue of sympathy and agony that binds the flesh in its nessus shirt the clotted cobweb of unself and self sheds itself and flecks the sun 's bed with darts of blossom like flagellant blood above the water bursting in the vibrant air this ego bound by personal tragedy and the vast impersonal vindictiveness of the ruined and ruining world pauses in this immortality as passionate as apathetic as the lava flow that burned here once and stopped here and said 'this far and no further and spoke thereafter in the simple diction of stone naked in the warm april air we lie under the redwoods in the sunny lee of a cliff as you kneel above me i see tiny red marks on your flanks like bites where the redwood cones have pressed into your flesh you can find just the same marks in the lignite in the cliff over our heads sequoia langsdorfii before the ice and sempervirens afterwards there is little difference except for all those years here in the sweet moribund fetor of spring flowers washed flotsam and jetsam together cool and naked together under this tree for a moment we have escaped the bitterness of love and love lost and love betrayed and what might have been and what might be fall equally away with what is and leave only these ideograms printed on the immortal hydrocarbons of flesh and stone

for john ashbery “ good barber of the pea ” i exhumed high into the vag where the barber keeps his pea — “ good sprout ” his mouth his gray hunted tongue always in the distance — “ no use denying we master the particular service we deny ourselves in the shade of this pea the sum of his shade and the gavel flexing above his head i will become a milliner to cover what work i ’ ve done or else i ’ ll begin anew at the infant chin where nothing grows but chins outside snails vines surpass me and must — gaining pews upon pews but don ’ t think for a sec i don ’ t know the way out of here that release is one hair — spiral stair — top of which cleavage evaporates ”
swimming the english channel struggling to make it to calais i swam into laura halfway across my body oiled for warmth black rubber cap on my head eyes hidden behind goggles i was exhausted ready to drown when i saw her coming toward me bobbing up and down between waves effortlessly doing a breaststroke headed for dover treading water i asked in french if she spoke english and she said “ yes i ’ m an american. ” i said “ hey me too ” then asked her out for coffee
i ’ m not yet comfortable with the word its short clean woosh that sounds like life at dinner last night my single girls said in admonition “ it ’ s not wife-approved ” about a friend ’ s upcoming trip their eyes rolled up and over and out their pretty young heads wife why does it sound like a job “ i need a wife ” the famous feminist wrote “ a wife that will keep my clothes clean ironed mended replaced if need be. ” a word that could be made easily into maid a wife that does fixes soothes honors obeys housewife fishwife bad wife good wife what ’ s the word for someone who stares long into the morning unable to even fix tea some days the kettle steaming over loud like a train whistle she who cries in the mornings she who tears a hole in the earth and can not stop grieving the one who wants to love you but often isn ’ t good at even that the one who doesn ’ t want to be diminished by how much she wants to be yours
the man who married magdalene had not forgiven her god might pardon every sin ... love is no pardoner her hands were hollow pale and blue her mouth like watered wine he watched to see if she were true and waited for a sign it was old harlotry he guessed that drained her strength away so gladly for the dark she dressed so sadly for the day their quarrels made her dull and weak and soon a man might fit a penny in the hollow cheek and never notice it at last as they exhausted slept death granted the divorce and nakedly the woman leapt upon that narrow horse but when he woke and woke alone he wept and would deny the loose behavior of the bone and the immodest thigh

why should a foolish marriage vow which long ago was made oblige us to each other now when passion is decay 'd we lov 'd and we lov 'd as long as we could till our love was lov 'd out in us both but our marriage is dead when the pleasure is fled 'twas pleasure first made it an oath if i have pleasures for a friend and farther love in store what wrong has he whose joys did end and who could give no more 't is a madness that he should be jealous of me or that i should bar him of another for all we can gain is to give our selves pain when neither can hinder the other

a monodrama come into the garden maud for the black bat night has flown come into the garden maud i am here at the gate alone and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad and the musk of the rose is blown for a breeze of morning moves and the planet of love is on high beginning to faint in the light that she loves in a bed of daffodil sky to faint in the light of the sun she loves to faint in his light and to die all night have the roses heard the flute violin bassoon all night has the casement jessamine stirr'd to the dancers dancing in tune till a silence fell with the waking bird and a hush with the setting moon i said to the lily `` there is but one with whom she has heart to be gay when will the dancers leave her alone she is weary of dance and play '' now half to the setting moon are gone and half to the rising day low on the sand and loud on the stone the last wheel echoes away i said to the rose `` the brief night goes in babble and revel and wine o young lord-lover what sighs are those for one that will never be thine but mine but mine '' so i sware to the rose `` for ever and ever mine '' and the soul of the rose went into my blood as the music clash 'd in the hall and long by the garden lake i stood for i heard your rivulet fall from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood our wood that is dearer than all from the meadow your walks have left so sweet that whenever a march-wind sighs he sets the jewel-print of your feet in violets blue as your eyes to the woody hollows in which we meet and the valleys of paradise the slender acacia would not shake one long milk-bloom on the tree the white lake-blossom fell into the lake as the pimpernel dozed on the lea but the rose was awake all night for your sake knowing your promise to me the lilies and roses were all awake they sigh 'd for the dawn and thee queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls come hither the dances are done in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls queen lily and rose in one shine out little head sunning over with curls to the flowers and be their sun there has fallen a splendid tear from the passion-flower at the gate she is coming my dove my dear she is coming my life my fate the red rose cries `` she is near she is near '' and the white rose weeps `` she is late '' the larkspur listens `` i hear i hear '' and the lily whispers `` i wait '' she is coming my own my sweet were it ever so airy a tread my heart would hear her and beat were it earth in an earthy bed my dust would hear her and beat had i lain for a century dead would start and tremble under her feet and blossom in purple and red
a monodrama o that 'twere possible after long grief and pain to find the arms of my true love round me once again when i was wont to meet her in the silent woody places by the home that gave me birth we stood tranced in long embraces mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter than anything on earth a shadow flits before me not thou but like to thee ah christ that it were possible for one short hour to see the souls we loved that they might tell us what and where they be it leads me forth at evening it lightly winds and steals in a cold white robe before me when all my spirit reels at the shouts the leagues of lights and the roaring of the wheels half the night i waste in sighs half in dreams i sorrow after the delight of early skies in a wakeful doze i sorrow for the hand the lips the eyes for the meeting of the morrow the delight of happy laughter the delight of low replies 't is a morning pure and sweet and a dewy splendour falls on the little flower that clings to the turrets and the walls 'tis a morning pure and sweet and the light and shadow fleet she is walking in the meadow and the woodland echo rings in a moment we shall meet she is singing in the meadow and the rivulet at her feet ripples on in light and shadow to the ballad that she sings so i hear her sing as of old my bird with the shining head my own dove with the tender eye but there rings on a sudden a passionate cry there is some one dying or dead and a sullen thunder is roll 'd for a tumult shakes the city and i wake my dream is fled in the shuddering dawn behold without knowledge without pity by the curtains of my bed that abiding phantom cold get thee hence nor come again mix not memory with doubt pass thou deathlike type of pain pass and cease to move about 't is the blot upon the brain that will show itself without then i rise the eave-drops fall and the yellow vapours choke the great city sounding wide the day comes a dull red ball wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke on the misty river-tide thro the hubbub of the market i steal a wasted frame it crosses here it crosses there thro all that crowd confused and loud the shadow still the same and on my heavy eyelids my anguish hangs like shame alas for her that met me that heard me softly call came glimmering thro the laurels at the quiet evenfall in the garden by the turrets of the old manorial hall would the happy spirit descend from the realms of light and song in the chamber or the street as she looks among the blest should i fear to greet my friend or to say `` forgive the wrong '' or to ask her `` take me sweet to the regions of thy rest '' but the broad light glares and beats and the shadow flits and fleets and will not let me be and i loathe the squares and streets and the faces that one meets hearts with no love for me always i long to creep into some still cavern deep there to weep and weep and weep my whole soul out to thee
if faith is a tree that sorrow grows and women repentant or not are swamps a man who comes for solace here will be up to his knees and slow getting out a name can turn on anyone but say that a woman washes the dust from a stranger ’ s feet and sits quite dry-eyed in front of her mirror at night the candle flame moves with her breath as does the hand of the painter who sees in the flame his chance for virtuosity she lets him leave her shoulder bare bedlam ’ s distilled from a mary too st. mary ’ s of bethlehem shelter for all the afflicted and weak of mind the donors conceived of as magi no doubt the mad and the newborn serve equally well for show a whore with a heart the rich with a conscience the keepers of language and hospitals badly embarrassed at times by their charge the mirror refuses the candle you see and tears on another ’ s behalf are not the mirrors he ’ s pleased to regard who loves his ironies buxom and grave must hate the foolish water of her eyes
give me more love or more disdain the torrid or the frozen zone bring equal ease unto my pain the temperate affords me none either extreme of love or hate is sweeter than a calm estate give me a storm if it be love like danae in that golden show'r i swim in pleasure if it prove disdain that torrent will devour my vulture-hopes and he 's possess'd of heaven that 's but from hell releas 'd then crown my joys or cure my pain give me more love or more disdain
i the grey sea and the long black land and the yellow half-moon large and low and the startled little waves that leap in fiery ringlets from their sleep as i gain the cove with pushing prow and quench its speed i the slushy sand ii then a mile of warm sea-scented beach three fields to cross till a farm appears a tap at the pane the quick sharp scratch and blue spurt of a lighted match and a voice less loud thro its joys and fears than the two hearts beating each to each
you are the problem i propose my dear the text my musings glose i call you for convenience love by definition you ’ re a cause inferred by necessary laws— you are so to the saints above but in this shadowy lower life i sleep with a terrestrial wife and earthy children i beget love is a fiction i must use a privilege i can abuse and sometimes something i forget now in the heavenly other place love is in the eternal mind the luminous form whose shade she is a ghost discarnate thought defined she was so to my early bliss she is so while i comprehend the forms my senses apprehend and in the end she will be so her whom my hands embrace i kiss her whom my mind infers i know the one exists in time and space and as she was she will not be the other is in her own grace and is she is eternally plato you shall not plague my life i married a terrestrial wife and hume she is not mere sensation in sequence of observed relation she has two forms—ah thank you duns — i know her in both ways at once i knew her yes before i knew her and by both means i must construe her and none among you shall undo her
thus piteously love closed what he begat the union of this ever-diverse pair these two were rapid falcons in a snare condemned to do the flitting of the bat lovers beneath the singing sky of may they wandered once clear as the dew on flowers but they fed not on the advancing hours their hearts held cravings for the buried day then each applied to each that fatal knife deep questioning which probes to endless dole ah what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certainties in this our life — in tragic hints here see what evermore moves dark as yonder midnight ocean 's force thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse to throw that faint thin line upon the shore
what soul would bargain for a cure that brings contempt the nobler agony to kill rather let me bear on the bitter ill and strike this rusty bosom with new stings it seems there is another veering fit since on a gold-haired lady 's eyeballs pure i looked with little prospect of a cure the while her mouth 's red bow loosed shafts of wit just heaven can it be true that jealousy has decked the woman thus and does her head swim somewhat for possessions forfeited madam you teach me many things that be i open an old book and there i find that `` women still may love whom they deceive '' such love i prize not madam by your leave the game you play at is not to my mind
at last we parley we so strangely dumb in such a close communion it befell about the sounding of the matin-bell and lo her place was vacant and the hum of loneliness was round me then i rose and my disordered brain did guide my foot to that old wood where our first love-salute was interchanged the source of many throes there did i see her not alone i moved toward her and made proffer of my arm she took it simply with no rude alarm and that disturbing shadow passed reproved i felt the pained speech coming and declared my firm belief in her ere she could speak a ghastly morning came into her cheek while with a widening soul on me she stared
in our old shipwrecked days there was an hour when in the firelight steadily aglow joined slackly we beheld the red chasm grow among the clicking coals our library-bower that eve was left to us and hushed we sat as lovers to whom time is whispering from sudden-opened doors we heard them sing the nodding elders mixed good wine with chat well knew we that life 's greatest treasure lay with us and of it was our talk `` ah yes love dies '' i said i never thought it less she yearned to me that sentence to unsay then when the fire domed blackening i found her cheek was salt against my kiss and swift up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift — now am i haunted by that taste that sound
i am not of those miserable males who sniff at vice and daring not to snap do therefore hope for heaven i take the hap of all my deeds the wind that fills my sails propels but i am helmsman am i wrecked i know the devil has sufficient weight to bear i lay it not on him or fate besides he 's damned that man i do suspect a coward who would burden the poor deuce with what ensues from his own slipperiness i have just found a wanton-scented tress in an old desk dusty for lack of use of days and nights it is demonstrative that like some aged star gleam luridly if for those times i must ask charity have i not any charity to give
what may the woman labour to confess there is about her mouth a nervous twitch 't is something to be told or hidden —which i get a glimpse of hell in this mild guess she has desires of touch as if to feel that all the household things are things she knew she stops before the glass what sight in view a face that seems the latest to reveal for she turns from it hastily and tossed irresolute steals shadow-like to where i stand and wavering pale before me there her tears fall still as oak-leaves after frost she will not speak i will not ask we are league-sundered by the silent gulf between yon burly lovers on the village green yours is a lower and a happier star
love ere he bleeds an eagle in high skies has earth beneath his wings from reddened eve he views the rosy dawn in vain they weave the fatal web below while far he flies but when the arrow strikes him there 's a change he moves but in the track of his spent pain whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain binding him to the ground with narrow range a subtle serpent then has love become i had the eagle in my bosom erst henceforward with the serpent i am cursed i can interpret where the mouth is dumb speak and i see the side-lie of a truth perchance my heart may pardon you this deed but be no coward —you that made love bleed you must bear all the venom of his tooth
madam would speak with me so now it comes the deluge or else fire she 's well she thanks my husbandship our chain on silence clanks time leers between above his twiddling thumbs am i quite well most excellent in health the journals too i diligently peruse vesuvius is expected to give news niagara is no noisier by stealth our eyes dart scrutinizing snakes she 's glad i 'm happy says her quivering under-lip `` and are not you '' `` how can i be '' `` take ship for happiness is somewhere to be had '' `` nowhere for me '' her voice is barely heard i am not melted and make no pretence with commonplace i freeze her tongue and sense niagara or vesuvius is deferred
drunken laughter escapes behind the fence woven with honeysuckle up to where i stand daddy ’ s running-buddy carson is beside him in the time it takes to turn watch a woman tiptoe pull a sheer blouse off the clothesline to see her sun-lit dress ride up peasant legs like the last image of mercy three are drinking from the mason jar that ’ s the oak we planted the day before i left town as if father son needed staking down to earth if anything could now plumb distance that tree comes close recounting lost friends as they turn into mist the woman stands in a kitchen folding a man ’ s trousers— her chin tucked to hold the cuffs straight i ’ m lonely as those storytellers in my father ’ s backyard i shall join soon alone as they are tilting back heads to let the burning ease down the names of women melt in their mouths like hot mints as if we didn ’ t know old man pagget ’ s stoopdown is doctored with slivers of red devil lye
i have studied the tight curls on the back of your neck moving away from me beyond anger or failure your face in the evening schools of longing through mornings of wish and ripen we were always saying goodbye in the blood in the bone over coffee before dashing for elevators going in opposite directions without goodbyes do not remember me as a bridge nor a roof as the maker of legends nor as a trap door to that world where black and white clericals hang on the edge of beauty in five oclock elevators twitching their shoulders to avoid other flesh and now there is someone to speak for them moving away from me into tomorrows morning of wish and ripen your goodbye is a promise of lightning in the last angels hand unwelcome and warning the sands have run out against us we were rewarded by journeys away from each other into desire into mornings alone where excuse and endurance mingle conceiving decision do not remember me as disaster nor as the keeper of secrets i am a fellow rider in the cattle cars watching you move slowly out of my bed saying we can not waste time only ourselves
my mind was once the true survey of all these meadows fresh and gay and in the greenness of the grass did see its hopes as in a glass when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me but these while i with sorrow pine grew more luxuriant still and fine that not one blade of grass you spy ’ d but had a flower on either side when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me unthankful meadows could you so a fellowship so true forgo and in your gaudy may-games meet while i lay trodden under feet when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me but what you in compassion ought shall now by my revenge be wrought and flow ’ rs and grass and i and all will in one common ruin fall for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me and thus ye meadows which have been companions of my thoughts more green shall now the heraldry become with which i shall adorn my tomb for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me
ye living lamps by whose dear light the nightingale does sit so late and studying all the summer night her matchless songs does meditate ye country comets that portend no war nor prince ’ s funeral shining unto no higher end than to presage the grass ’ s fall ye glow-worms whose officious flame to wand ’ ring mowers shows the way that in the night have lost their aim and after foolish fires do stray your courteous lights in vain you waste since juliana here is come for she my mind hath so displac ’ d that i shall never find my home

i now think love is rather deaf than blind for else it could not be that she whom i adore so much should so slight me and cast my love behind i 'm sure my language to her was as sweet and every close did meet in sentence of as subtle feet as hath the youngest he that sits in shadow of apollo 's tree o but my conscious fears that fly my thoughts between tell me that she hath seen my hundred of gray hairs told seven and forty years read so much waste as she can not embrace my mountain belly and my rocky face and all these through her eyes have stopp 'd her ears
the wallful of quoted passages from his work with the requisite specimens pinned next to their literary cameo appearances was too good a temptation to resist and if the curator couldn ’ t why should we the prose dipped and shimmered and the “ flies ” as i heard a buff call them stood at lurid attention on their pins if you love to read and look you could be happy a month in that small room one of the nabokov photos i ’ d never seen he ’ s writing left-handed why did i never trouble to find out at his stand-up desk in the hotel apartment in montreux the picture ’ s mostly of his back and the small wedge of face that shows brims with indifference to anything not on the page the window ’ s shut a tiny lamp trails a veil of light over the page too far away for us to read we also liked the chest of specimen drawers labeled as if for apprentice freudians “ genitalia ” wherein languished in phials the thousands he examined for his monograph on the lycaenidae the silver-studded blues and there in the center of the room a carillon of blues rang mutely out there must have been three hundred of them amanda ’ s blue was there and the chalk hill blue the karner blue lycaeides melissa samuelis nabokov a violet-tinged copper the mourning cloak an echo azure the white-lined green hairstreak the cretan argus known only from mt ida in the series nabokov did on this beauty he noted for each specimen the altitude at which it had been taken and as the ads and lovers say “ and much much more. ” the stilled belle of the tower was a lycaeides melissa melissa no doubt it ’ s an accident melissa rhymes sort of with lolita the scant hour we could lavish on the blues flew by and we improvised a path through cars and slush and boot-high berms of mud-blurred snow to wherever we went next i must have been mute or whatever i said won from silence nothing it mourned to lose i was back in that small room vast by love of each flickering detail each genital dusting to nothing the turn like a worm ’ s or caterpillar ’ s of each phrase i stood up to my ankles in sludge pooled over a stopped sewer grate and thought— wouldn ’ t you know it—about love and art you can be ruined “ rurnt ” as we said in south- western ohio by a book or improved by a butterfly you can dodder in the slop septic with a rage not for order but for the love the senses bear for what they do for detail that ’ s never annexed like a reluctant crumb to a vacuum cleaner to a coherence you can be bead after bead on perception ’ s rosary this is the sweet ache that hurts most the way desire burns bluely at its phosphorescent core just as you ’ re having what you wanted most you want it more and more until that ’ s more than you or it or both of you can bear

watching that frenzy of insects above the bush of white flowers bush i see everywhere on hill after hill all i can think of is how terrifying spring is in its tireless mindless replications everywhere emergence seed case chrysalis uterus endless manufacturing and the wrapped stacks of styrofoam cups in the grocery lately i can ’ t stand them the shelves of canned beans and soups freezers of identical dinners then the snowflake-diamond-snowflake of the rug beneath my chair rows of books turning their backs even my two feet how they mirror each other oppresses me the way they fit so perfectly together how i can nestle one big toe into the other like little continents that have drifted my god the unity of everything my hands and eyes yours doesn ’ t that frighten you sometimes remembering the pleasure of nakedness in fresh sheets all the lovers there before you beside you crowding you out and the scouring griefs don ’ t look at them all or they ’ ll kill you you can barely encompass your own i ’ m saying i know all about you whoever you are it ’ s spring and it ’ s starting again the longing that begins and begins and begins
i the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea in a beautiful pea-green boat they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a five-pound note the owl looked up to the stars above and sang to a small guitar '' o lovely pussy o pussy my love what a beautiful pussy you are you are you are what a beautiful pussy you are '' ii pussy said to the owl `` you elegant fowl how charmingly sweet you sing o let us be married too long we have tarried but what shall we do for a ring '' they sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the bong-tree grows and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood with a ring at the end of his nose his nose his nose with a ring at the end of his nose iii '' dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling your ring '' said the piggy `` i will '' so they took it away and were married next day by the turkey who lives on the hill they dined on mince and slices of quince which they ate with a runcible spoon and hand in hand on the edge of the sand they danced by the light of the moon the moon the moon they danced by the light of the moon
ere on my bed my limbs i lay it hath not been my use to pray with moving lips or bended knees but silently by slow degrees my spirit i to love compose in humble trust mine eye-lids close with reverential resignation no wish conceived no thought exprest only a sense of supplication a sense o'er all my soul imprest that i am weak yet not unblest since in me round me every where eternal strength and wisdom are but yester-night i prayed aloud in anguish and in agony up-starting from the fiendish crowd of shapes and thoughts that tortured me a lurid light a trampling throng sense of intolerable wrong and whom i scorned those only strong thirst of revenge the powerless will still baffled and yet burning still desire with loathing strangely mixed on wild or hateful objects fixed fantastic passions maddening brawl and shame and terror over all deeds to be hid which were not hid which all confused i could not know whether i suffered or i did for all seemed guilt remorse or woe my own or others still the same life-stifling fear soul-stifling shame so two nights passed the night 's dismay saddened and stunned the coming day sleep the wide blessing seemed to me distemper 's worst calamity the third night when my own loud scream had waked me from the fiendish dream o'ercome with sufferings strange and wild i wept as i had been a child and having thus by tears subdued my anguish to a milder mood such punishments i said were due to natures deepliest stained with sin — for aye entempesting anew the unfathomable hell within the horror of their deeds to view to know and loathe yet wish and do such griefs with such men well agree but wherefore wherefore fall on me to be loved is all i need and whom i love i love indeed

we have gone out in boats upon the sea at night lost and the vast waters close traps of fear about us the boats are driven apart and we are alone at last under the incalculable sky listless diseased with stars let the oars be idle my love and forget at this time our love like a knife between us defining the boundaries that we can never cross nor destroy as we drift into the heart of our dream cutting the silence slyly the bitter rain in our mouths and the dark wound closed in behind us forget depth-bombs death and promises we made gardens laid waste and over the wastelands westward the rooms where we had come together bombd but even as we leave your love turns back i feel your absence like the ringing of bells silenced and salt over your eyes and the scales of salt between us now you pass with ease into the destructive world there is a dry crash of cement the light fails falls into the ruins of cities upon the distant shore and within the indestructible night i am alone

i walk down the garden paths and all the daffodils are blowing and the bright blue squills i walk down the patterned garden paths in my stiff brocaded gown with my powdered hair and jewelled fan i too am a rare pattern as i wander down the garden paths my dress is richly figured and the train makes a pink and silver stain on the gravel and the thrift of the borders just a plate of current fashion tripping by in high-heeled ribboned shoes not a softness anywhere about me only whale-bone and brocade and i sink on a seat in the shade of a lime tree for my passion wars against the stiff brocade the daffodils and squills flutter in the breeze as they please and i weep for the lime tree is in blossom and one small flower has dropped upon my bosom and the splashing of waterdrops in the marble fountain comes down the garden paths the dripping never stops underneath my stiffened gown is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin a basin in the midst of hedges grown so thick she can not see her lover hiding but she guesses he is near and the sliding of the water seems the stroking of a dear hand upon her what is summer in a fine brocaded gown i should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground all the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground i would be the pink and silver as i ran along the paths and he would stumble after bewildered by my laughter i should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes i would choose to lead him in a maze along the patterned paths a bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover till he caught me in the shade and the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me aching melting unafraid with the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops and the plopping of the waterdrops all about us in the open afternoon i am very like to swoon with the weight of this brocade for the sun sifts through the shade underneath the fallen blossom in my bosom is a letter i have hid it was brought to me this morning by a rider from the duke “ madam we regret to inform you that lord hartwell died in action thursday sen ’ night. ” as i read it in the white morning sunlight the letters squirmed like snakes “ any answer madam ” said my footman “ no ” l told him “ see that the messenger takes some refreshment no no answer. ” and i walked into the garden up and down the patterned paths in my stiff correct brocade the blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun each one i stood upright too held rigid to the pattern by the stiffness of my gown up and down i walked up and down in a month he would have been my husband in a month here underneath this lime we would have broke the pattern he for me and i for him he as colonel i as lady on this shady seat he had a whim that sunlight carried blessing and i answered “ it shall be as you have said. ” now he is dead in summer and in winter i shall walk up and down the patterned garden paths in my stiff brocaded gown the squills and daffodils will give place to pillared roses and to asters and to snow i shall go up and down in my gown gorgeously arrayed boned and stayed and the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace by each button hook and lace for the man who should loose me is dead fighting with the duke in flanders in a pattern called a war christ what are patterns for

in sixth grade mrs. walker slapped the back of my head and made me stand in the corner for not knowing the difference between persimmon and precision how to choose persimmons this is precision ripe ones are soft and brown-spotted sniff the bottoms the sweet one will be fragrant how to eat put the knife away lay down newspaper peel the skin tenderly not to tear the meat chew the skin suck it and swallow now eat the meat of the fruit so sweet all of it to the heart donna undresses her stomach is white in the yard dewy and shivering with crickets we lie naked face-up face-down i teach her chinese crickets chiu chiu dew i ’ ve forgotten naked i ’ ve forgotten ni wo you and me i part her legs remember to tell her she is beautiful as the moon other words that got me into trouble were fight and fright wren and yarn fight was what i did when i was frightened fright was what i felt when i was fighting wrens are small plain birds yarn is what one knits with wrens are soft as yarn my mother made birds out of yarn i loved to watch her tie the stuff a bird a rabbit a wee man mrs. walker brought a persimmon to class and cut it up so everyone could taste a chinese apple knowing it wasn ’ t ripe or sweet i didn ’ t eat but watched the other faces my mother said every persimmon has a sun inside something golden glowing warm as my face once in the cellar i found two wrapped in newspaper forgotten and not yet ripe i took them and set both on my bedroom windowsill where each morning a cardinal sang the sun the sun finally understanding he was going blind my father sat up all one night waiting for a song a ghost i gave him the persimmons swelled heavy as sadness and sweet as love this year in the muddy lighting of my parents ’ cellar i rummage looking for something i lost my father sits on the tired wooden stairs black cane between his knees hand over hand gripping the handle he ’ s so happy that i ’ ve come home i ask how his eyes are a stupid question all gone he answers under some blankets i find a box inside the box i find three scrolls i sit beside him and untie three paintings by my father hibiscus leaf and a white flower two cats preening two persimmons so full they want to drop from the cloth he raises both hands to touch the cloth asks which is this this is persimmons father oh the feel of the wolftail on the silk the strength the tense precision in the wrist i painted them hundreds of times eyes closed these i painted blind some things never leave a person scent of the hair of one you love the texture of persimmons in your palm the ripe weight
i just as my fingers on these keys make music so the selfsame sounds on my spirit make a music too music is feeling then not sound and thus it is that what i feel here in this room desiring you thinking of your blue-shadowed silk is music it is like the strain waked in the elders by susanna of a green evening clear and warm she bathed in her still garden while the red-eyed elders watching felt the basses of their beings throb in witching chords and their thin blood pulse pizzicati of hosanna ii in the green water clear and warm susanna lay she searched the touch of springs and found concealed imaginings she sighed for so much melody upon the bank she stood in the cool of spent emotions she felt among the leaves the dew of old devotions she walked upon the grass still quavering the winds were like her maids on timid feet fetching her woven scarves yet wavering a breath upon her hand muted the night she turned— a cymbal crashed and roaring horns iii soon with a noise like tambourines came her attendant byzantines they wondered why susanna cried against the elders by her side and as they whispered the refrain was like a willow swept by rain anon their lamps uplifted flame revealed susanna and her shame and then the simpering byzantines fled with a noise like tambourines iv beauty is momentary in the mind— the fitful tracing of a portal but in the flesh it is immortal the body dies the body 's beauty lives so evenings die in their green going a wave interminably flowing so gardens die their meek breath scenting the cowl of winter done repenting so maidens die to the auroral celebration of a maiden 's choral susanna 's music touched the bawdy strings of those white elders but escaping left only death 's ironic scraping now in its immortality it plays on the clear viol of her memory and makes a constant sacrament of praise
the jaunty crop-haired graying women in grocery stores their clothes boyish and neat new mittens or clean sneakers clean hands hips not bad still buying ice cream steaks soda fresh melons and soap—or the big balding young men in work shoes and green work pants beer belly and white t-shirt the porky walk back to the truck polite possible to feel briefly like jesus a gust of diffuse tenderness crossing the dark spaces to where the dry self burrows or nests something that stirs watching the kinds of people on the street for a while— but how love falters and flags when anyone ’ s difficult eyes come into focus terrible gaze of a unique soul its need unlovable my friend in his divorced schoolteacher apartment his own unsuspected paintings hung everywhere which his wife kept in a closet— not he says that she wasn ’ t perfectly right or me mis-hearing my rock radio sing my self-pity “ the angels wished him dead ” —all the hideous sudden stare of self soul showing through like the lizard ancestry showing in the frontal gaze of a robin busy on the lawn in the movies when the sensitive young jewish soldier nearly drowns trying to rescue the thrashing anti-semitic bully swimming across the river raked by nazi fire the awful part is the part truth hate my whole kind but me love me for myself the weather changes in the black of night and the dream-wind bowling across the sopping open spaces of roads golf courses parking lots flails a commotion in the dripping treetops tries a half-rotten shingle or a down-hung branch and we all dream it the dark wind crossing the wide spaces between us
at night chinamen jump on asia with a thump while in our willful way we in secret play affectionate games and bruise our knees like china ’ s shoes the birds push apples through grass the moon turns blue these apples roll beneath our buttocks like a heath full of chinese thrushes flushed from china ’ s bushes as we love at night birds sing out of sight chinese rhythms beat through us in our heat the apples and the birds move us like soft words we couple in the grace of that mysterious race
the rain set early in to-night the sullen wind was soon awake it tore the elm-tops down for spite and did its worst to vex the lake i listened with heart fit to break when glided in porphyria straight she shut the cold out and the storm and kneeled and made the cheerless grate blaze up and all the cottage warm which done she rose and from her form withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl and laid her soiled gloves by untied her hat and let the damp hair fall and last she sat down by my side and called me when no voice replied she put my arm about her waist and made her smooth white shoulder bare and all her yellow hair displaced and stooping made my cheek lie there and spread o'er all her yellow hair murmuring how she loved me — she too weak for all her heart 's endeavour to set its struggling passion free from pride and vainer ties dissever and give herself to me for ever but passion sometimes would prevail nor could to-night 's gay feast restrain a sudden thought of one so pale for love of her and all in vain so she was come through wind and rain be sure i looked up at her eyes happy and proud at last i knew porphyria worshipped me surprise made my heart swell and still it grew while i debated what to do that moment she was mine mine fair perfectly pure and good i found a thing to do and all her hair in one long yellow string i wound three times her little throat around and strangled her no pain felt she i am quite sure she felt no pain as a shut bud that holds a bee i warily oped her lids again laughed the blue eyes without a stain and i untightened next the tress about her neck her cheek once more blushed bright beneath my burning kiss i propped her head up as before only this time my shoulder bore her head which droops upon it still the smiling rosy little head so glad it has its utmost will that all it scorned at once is fled and i its love am gained instead porphyria 's love she guessed not how her darling one wish would be heard and thus we sit together now and all night long we have not stirred and yet god has not said a word
thou hast committed — fornication but that was in another country and besides the wench is dead the jew of malta i among the smoke and fog of a december afternoon you have the scene arrange itself — as it will seem to do— with `` i have saved this afternoon for you '' and four wax candles in the darkened room four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead an atmosphere of juliet 's tomb prepared for all the things to be said or left unsaid we have been let us say to hear the latest pole transmit the preludes through his hair and finger-tips `` so intimate this chopin that i think his soul should be resurrected only among friends some two or three who will not touch the bloom that is rubbed and questioned in the concert room '' —and so the conversation slips among velleities and carefully caught regrets through attenuated tones of violins mingled with remote cornets and begins `` you do not know how much they mean to me my friends and how how rare and strange it is to find in a life composed so much so much of odds and ends for indeed i do not love it ... you knew you are not blind how keen you are to find a friend who has these qualities who has and gives those qualities upon which friendship lives how much it means that i say this to you — without these friendships — life what cauchemar '' among the winding of the violins and the ariettes of cracked cornets inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins absurdly hammering a prelude of its own capricious monotone that is at least one definite `` false note '' — let us take the air in a tobacco trance admire the monuments discuss the late events correct our watches by the public clocks then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks ii now that lilacs are in bloom she has a bowl of lilacs in her room and twists one in her fingers while she talks `` ah my friend you do not know you do not know what life is you who hold it in your hands '' slowly twisting the lilac stalks '' you let it flow from you you let it flow and youth is cruel and has no remorse and smiles at situations which it can not see '' i smile of course and go on drinking tea `` yet with these april sunsets that somehow recall my buried life and paris in the spring i feel immeasurably at peace and find the world to be wonderful and youthful after all '' the voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune of a broken violin on an august afternoon '' i am always sure that you understand my feelings always sure that you feel sure that across the gulf you reach your hand you are invulnerable you have no achilles heel you will go on and when you have prevailed you can say at this point many a one has failed but what have i but what have i my friend to give you what can you receive from me only the friendship and the sympathy of one about to reach her journey 's end i shall sit here serving tea to friends ... '' i take my hat how can i make a cowardly amends for what she has said to me you will see me any morning in the park reading the comics and the sporting page particularly i remark an english countess goes upon the stage a greek was murdered at a polish dance another bank defaulter has confessed i keep my countenance i remain self-possessed except when a street-piano mechanical and tired reiterates some worn-out common song with the smell of hyacinths across the garden recalling things that other people have desired are these ideas right or wrong iii the october night comes down returning as before except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease i mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door and feel as if i had mounted on my hands and knees `` and so you are going abroad and when do you return but that 's a useless question you hardly know when you are coming back you will find so much to learn '' my smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac `` perhaps you can write to me '' my self-possession flares up for a second this is as i had reckoned `` i have been wondering frequently of late but our beginnings never know our ends why we have not developed into friends '' i feel like one who smiles and turning shall remark suddenly his expression in a glass my self-possession gutters we are really in the dark `` for everybody said so all our friends they all were sure our feelings would relate so closely i myself can hardly understand we must leave it now to fate you will write at any rate perhaps it is not too late i shall sit here serving tea to friends '' and i must borrow every changing shape to find expression ... dance dance like a dancing bear cry like a parrot chatter like an ape let us take the air in a tobacco trance— well and what if she should die some afternoon afternoon grey and smoky evening yellow and rose should die and leave me sitting pen in hand with the smoke coming down above the housetops doubtful for quite a while not knowing what to feel or if i understand or whether wise or foolish tardy or too soon ... would she not have the advantage after all this music is successful with a `` dying fall '' now that we talk of dying— and should i have the right to smile
this is her picture as she was it seems a thing to wonder on as though mine image in the glass should tarry when myself am gone i gaze until she seems to stir — until mine eyes almost aver that now even now the sweet lips part to breathe the words of the sweet heart — and yet the earth is over her alas even such the thin-drawn ray that makes the prison-depths more rude — the drip of water night and day giving a tongue to solitude yet only this of love 's whole prize remains save what in mournful guise takes counsel with my soul alone — save what is secret and unknown below the earth above the skies in painting her i shrin 'd her face mid mystic trees where light falls in hardly at all a covert place where you might think to find a din of doubtful talk and a live flame wandering and many a shape whose name not itself knoweth and old dew and your own footsteps meeting you and all things going as they came a deep dim wood and there she stands as in that wood that day for so was the still movement of her hands and such the pure line 's gracious flow and passing fair the type must seem unknown the presence and the dream 't is she though of herself alas less than her shadow on the grass or than her image in the stream that day we met there i and she one with the other all alone and we were blithe yet memory saddens those hours as when the moon looks upon daylight and with her i stoop 'd to drink the spring-water athirst where other waters sprang and where the echo is she sang — my soul another echo there but when that hour my soul won strength for words whose silence wastes and kills dull raindrops smote us and at length thunder 'd the heat within the hills that eve i spoke those words again beside the pelted window-pane and there she hearken 'd what i said with under-glances that survey'd the empty pastures blind with rain next day the memories of these things like leaves through which a bird has flown still vibrated with love 's warm wings till i must make them all my own and paint this picture so 'twixt ease of talk and sweet long silences she stood among the plants in bloom at windows of a summer room to feign the shadow of the trees and as i wrought while all above and all around was fragrant air in the sick burthen of my love it seem 'd each sun-thrill 'd blossom there beat like a heart among the leaves o heart that never beats nor heaves in that one darkness lying still what now to thee my love 's great will or the fine web the sunshine weaves for now doth daylight disavow those days —nought left to see or hear only in solemn whispers now at night-time these things reach mine ear when the leaf-shadows at a breath shrink in the road and all the heath forest and water far and wide in limpid starlight glorified lie like the mystery of death last night at last i could have slept and yet delay 'd my sleep till dawn still wandering then it was i wept for unawares i came upon those glades where once she walk 'd with me and as i stood there suddenly all wan with traversing the night upon the desolate verge of light yearn 'd loud the iron-bosom 'd sea even so where heaven holds breath and hears the beating heart of love 's own breast — where round the secret of all spheres all angels lay their wings to rest — how shall my soul stand rapt and aw 'd when by the new birth borne abroad throughout the music of the suns it enters in her soul at once and knows the silence there for god here with her face doth memory sit meanwhile and wait the day 's decline till other eyes shall look from it eyes of the spirit 's palestine even than the old gaze tenderer while hopes and aims long lost with her stand round her image side by side like tombs of pilgrims that have died about the holy sepulchre
come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang in height and cold the splendour of the hills but cease to move so near the heavens and cease to glide a sunbeam by the blasted pine to sit a star upon the sparkling spire and come for love is of the valley come for love is of the valley come thou down and find him by the happy threshold he or hand in hand with plenty in the maize or red with spirted purple of the vats or foxlike in the vine nor cares to walk with death and morning on the silver horns nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice that huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls to roll the torrent out of dusky doors but follow let the torrent dance thee down to find him in the valley let the wild lean-headed eagles yelp alone and leave the monstrous ledges there to slope and spill their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke that like a broken purpose waste in air so waste not thou but come for all the vales await thee azure pillars of the hearth arise to thee the children call and i thy shepherd pipe and sweet is every sound sweeter thy voice but every sound is sweet myriads of rivulets hurrying thro the lawn the moan of doves in immemorial elms and murmuring of innumerable bees
now sleeps the crimson petal now the white nor waves the cypress in the palace walk nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font the firefly wakens waken thou with me now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost and like a ghost she glimmers on to me now lies the earth all danaë to the stars and all thy heart lies open unto me now slides the silent meteor on and leaves a shining furrow as thy thoughts in me now folds the lily all her sweetness up and slips into the bosom of the lake so fold thyself my dearest thou and slip into my bosom and be lost in me
o swallow swallow flying flying south fly to her and fall upon her gilded eaves and tell her tell her what i tell to thee o tell her swallow thou that knowest each that bright and fierce and fickle is the south and dark and true and tender is the north o swallow swallow if i could follow and light upon her lattice i would pipe and trill and cheep and twitter twenty million loves o were i thou that she might take me in and lay me on her bosom and her heart would rock the snowy cradle till i died why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love delaying as the tender ash delays to clothe herself when all the woods are green o tell her swallow that thy brood is flown say to her i do but wanton in the south but in the north long since my nest is made o tell her brief is life but love is long and brief the sun of summer in the north and brief the moon of beauty in the south o swallow flying from the golden woods fly to her and pipe and woo her and make her mine and tell her tell her that i follow thee
it was twilight all day sometimes the smallest things weigh us down small stones that we ca n't help admiring and palming look at the tiny way this lighter vein got inside look at the heavy gray dome of its sky this is no immutable world we know less than its atoms rushing through light light light as air to them for all we know trust me on this one there is happiness at stake boulder grain planet dust what fills the stones fills us i remember or i have a feeling i could be living somewhere with you weighted down the way we are n't now often the greatest things those you 'd think would be the heaviest are the very ones that float
seven dog-days we let pass naming queens in glenmacnass all the rare and royal names wormy sheepskin yet retains etain helen maeve and fand golden deirdre 's tender hand bert the big-foot sung by villon cassandra ronsard found in lyon queens of sheba meath and connaught coifed with crown or gaudy bonnet queens whose finger once did stir men queens were eaten of fleas and vermin queens men drew like monna lisa or slew with drugs in rome and pisa we named lucrezia crivelli and titian 's lady with amber belly queens acquainted in learned sin jane of jewry 's slender shin queens who cut the bogs of glanna judith of scripture and gloriana queens who wasted the east by proxy or drove the ass-cart a tinker 's doxy yet these are rotten — i ask their pardon — and we 've the sun on rock and garden these are rotten so you 're the queen of all the living or have been
i can feel she has got out of bed that means it is seven a.m. i have been lying with eyes shut thinking or possibly dreaming of how she might look if at breakfast i spoke about the hidden place in her which to me is like a soprano ’ s tremolo and right then over toast and bramble jelly if such things are possible she came i imagine she would show it while trying to conceal it i imagine her hair would fall about her face and she would become apparently downcast as she does at a concert when she is moved the hypnopompic play passes and i open my eyes and there she is next to the bed bending to a low drawer picking over various small smooth black white and pink items of underwear she bends so low her back runs parallel to the earth but there is no sway in it there is little burden the day has hardly begun the two mounds of muscles for walking leaping lovemaking lift toward the east—what can i say simile is useless there is nothing like them on earth her breasts fall full the nipples are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron bars of the gate under the earth where those who could not love press wanting to be born again i reach out and take her wrist and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my pajamas later when i open my eyes there she is again rummaging in the same low drawer the clock shows eight hmmm with huge silent effort of great mounded muscles the earth has been turning she takes a piece of silken cloth from the drawer and stands up under the falls of hair her face has become quiet and downcast as if she will be all day among strangers looking down inside herself at our rapture
coming together it is easier to work after our bodies meet paper and pen neither care nor profit whether we write or not but as your body moves under my hands charged and waiting we cut the leash you create me against your thighs hilly with images moving through our word countries my body writes into your flesh the poem you make of me touching you i catch midnight as moon fires set in my throat i love you flesh into blossom i made you and take you made into me
o my luve is like a red red rose that ’ s newly sprung in june o my luve is like the melody that ’ s sweetly played in tune so fair art thou my bonnie lass so deep in luve am i and i will luve thee still my dear till a ’ the seas gang dry till a ’ the seas gang dry my dear and the rocks melt wi ’ the sun i will love thee still my dear while the sands o ’ life shall run and fare thee weel my only luve and fare thee weel awhile and i will come again my luve though it were ten thousand mile
when my grave is broke up again some second guest to entertain for graves have learn 'd that woman head to be to more than one a bed and he that digs it spies a bracelet of bright hair about the bone will he not let'us alone and think that there a loving couple lies who thought that this device might be some way to make their souls at the last busy day meet at this grave and make a little stay if this fall in a time or land where mis-devotion doth command then he that digs us up will bring us to the bishop and the king to make us relics then thou shalt be a mary magdalen and i a something else thereby all women shall adore us and some men and since at such time miracles are sought i would have that age by this paper taught what miracles we harmless lovers wrought first we lov 'd well and faithfully yet knew not what we lov 'd nor why difference of sex no more we knew than our guardian angels do coming and going we perchance might kiss but not between those meals our hands ne'er touch 'd the seals which nature injur 'd by late law sets free these miracles we did but now alas all measure and all language i should pass should i tell what a miracle she was
remember me when i am gone away gone far away into the silent land when you can no more hold me by the hand nor i half turn to go yet turning stay remember me when no more day by day you tell me of our future that you plann 'd only remember me you understand it will be late to counsel then or pray yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember do not grieve for if the darkness and corruption leave a vestige of the thoughts that once i had better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad
cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee far far removed cold in the dreary grave have i forgot my only love to love thee severed at last by time 's all-severing wave now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover over the mountains on that northern shore resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover thy noble heart forever ever more cold in the earth—and fifteen wild decembers from those brown hills have melted into spring faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers after such years of change and suffering sweet love of youth forgive if i forget thee while the world 's tide is bearing me along other desires and other hopes beset me hopes which obscure but can not do thee wrong no later light has lightened up my heaven no second morn has ever shone for me all my life 's bliss from thy dear life was given all my life 's bliss is in the grave with thee but when the days of golden dreams had perished and even despair was powerless to destroy then did i learn how existence could be cherished strengthened and fed without the aid of joy then did i check the tears of useless passion— weaned my young soul from yearning after thine sternly denied its burning wish to hasten down to that tomb already more than mine and even yet i dare not let it languish dare not indulge in memory 's rapturous pain once drinking deep of that divinest anguish how could i seek the empty world again

the same to me are sombre days and gay though joyous dawns the rosy morn and bright because my dearest love is gone away within my heart is melancholy night my heart beats low in loneliness despite that riotous summer holds the earth in sway in cerements my spirit is bedight the same to me are sombre days and gay though breezes in the rippling grasses play and waves dash high and far in glorious might i thrill no longer to the sparkling day though joyous dawns the rosy morn and bright ungraceful seems to me the swallow 's flight as well might heaven 's blue be sullen gray my soul discerns no beauty in their sight because my dearest love is gone away let roses fling afar their crimson spray and virgin daisies splash the fields with white let bloom the poppy hotly as it may within my heart is melancholy night and this oh love my pitiable plight whenever from my circling arms you stray this little world of mine has lost its light ... i hope to god my dear that you can say the same to me

on nights when the moon seems impenetrable— a locked porthole to space when the householder bars his windows and doors and his dog lies until dawn one jeweled eye open when the maiden sleeps with her rosy knees sealed tightly together on such nights the safecracker sets to work axe chisel nitroglycerin within the vault lie forty thousand tons of gold the heaped up spoils of ali baba 's cave the secrets of the molecule he sands his fingertips to feel the subtle vibrations of wheel lining up just so with wheel his toolmarks are his fingerprints and now a crack appears on the side of the egg a single fault line and within the golden yolk just waiting a kind of wind a door flies open a glitter of forsythia forced out of the branch with smoothest fingertips you touch the locked cage of my ribs just so my knees fall open and cleopatra smiles whose own egyptians first invented the lock
i scissor the stem of the red carnation and set it in a bowl of water it floats the way your head would if i cut it off but what if i tore you apart for those afternoons when i was fifteen and so like a bird of paradise slaughtered for its feathers even my name suggested wings wicker cages flight come sit on my lap you said i felt as if i had flown there i was weightless you were forty and married that she was my mother never mattered she was a door that opened onto me the three of us blended into a kind of somnolence and musk the musk of sundays sweat and sweetness that dried plum and licorice taste always back of my tongue and your tongue against my teeth then touching mine how many times — i counted but could never remember and when i thought we ’ d go on forever that nothing could stop us as we fell endlessly from consciousness orders came war in the north your sword the gold epaulets the uniform so brightly colored so unlike war i thought and your horse how you rode out the gate no how that horse danced beneath you toward the sound of cannon fire i could hear it so many leagues away i could see you fall your face scarlet the horse dancing on without you and at the same moment mother sighed and turned clumsily in the hammock the madeira in the thin-stemmed glass spilled into the grass and i felt myself hardening to a brandy-colored wood my skin a thousand strings drawn so taut that when i walked to the house i could hear music tumbling like a waterfall of china silk behind me i took your letter from my bodice salome i heard your voice little bird fly but i did not i untied the lilac ribbon at my breasts and lay down on your bed after a while i heard mother 's footsteps watched her walk to the window i closed my eyes and when i opened them the shadow of a sword passed through my throat and mother dressed like a grenadier bent and kissed me on the lips

your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle everything i do is stitched with its color
i that was i you heard last night when there rose no moon at all nor to pierce the strained and tight tent of heaven a planet small life was dead and so was light ii not a twinkle from the fly not a glimmer from the worm when the crickets stopped their cry when the owls forbore a term you heard music that was i. iii earth turned in her sleep with pain sultrily suspired for proof in at heaven and out again lightning —- where it broke the roof bloodlike some few drops of rain iv what they could my words expressed o my love my all my one singing helped the verses best and when singing 's best was done to my lute i left the rest v so wore night the east was gray white the broad-faced hemlock-flowers there would be another day ere its first of heavy hours found me i had passed away vi what became of all the hopes words and song and lute as well say this struck you —- `` when life gropes feebly for the path where fell light last on the evening slopes vii '' one friend in that path shall be to secure my step from wrong one to count night day for me patient through the watches long serving most with none to see '' viii never say —- as something bodes —- '' so the worst has yet a worse when life halts 'neath double loads better the taskmaster 's curse than such music on the roads ix '' when no moon succeeds the sun nor can pierce the midnight 's tent any star the smallest one while some drops where lightning rent show the final storm begun —- x '' when the fire-fly hides its spot when the garden-voices fail in the darkness thick and hot —- shall another voice avail that shape be where these are not xi '' has some plague a longer lease proffering its help uncouth ca n't one even die in peace as one shuts one 's eyes on youth is that face the last one sees '' xii oh how dark your villa was windows fast and obdurate how the garden grudged me grass where i stood —- the iron gate ground its teeth to let me pass
she dwelt among the untrodden ways beside the springs of dove a maid whom there were none to praise and very few to love a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye —fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky she lived unknown and few could know when lucy ceased to be but she is in her grave and oh the difference to me
she walks in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies and all that ’ s best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes thus mellowed to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies one shade the more one ray the less had half impaired the nameless grace which waves in every raven tress or softly lightens o ’ er her face where thoughts serenely sweet express how pure how dear their dwelling-place and on that cheek and o ’ er that brow so soft so calm yet eloquent the smiles that win the tints that glow but tell of days in goodness spent a mind at peace with all below a heart whose love is innocent
she was a phantom of delight when first she gleamed upon my sight a lovely apparition sent to be a moment 's ornament her eyes as stars of twilight fair like twilight 's too her dusky hair but all things else about her drawn from may-time and the cheerful dawn a dancing shape an image gay to haunt to startle and way-lay i saw her upon nearer view a spirit yet a woman too her household motions light and free and steps of virgin-liberty a countenance in which did meet sweet records promises as sweet a creature not too bright or good for human nature 's daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles and now i see with eye serene the very pulse of the machine a being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller between life and death the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill a perfect woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command and yet a spirit still and bright with something of angelic light
along the field as we came by a year ago my love and i the aspen over stile and stone was talking to itself alone `` oh who are these that kiss and pass a country lover and his lass two lovers looking to be wed and time shall put them both to bed but she shall lie with earth above and he beside another love '' and sure enough beneath the tree there walks another love with me and overhead the aspen heaves its rainy-sounding silver leaves and i spell nothing in their stir but now perhaps they speak to her and plain for her to understand they talk about a time at hand when i shall sleep with clover clad and she beside another lad
o rose thou art sick the invisible worm that flies in the night in the howling storm has found out thy bed of crimson joy and his dark secret love does thy life destroy
since so ye please to hear me plain and that ye do rejoice my smart me list no lenger to remain to such as be so overthwart but cursed be that cruel heart which hath procur ’ d a careless mind for me and mine unfeigned smart and forceth me such faults to find more than too much i am assured of thine intent whereto to trust a speedless proof i have endured and now i leave it to them that lust
when i first heard you on the phone your voice had to be that '40s wartime voice for it to get under my skin like it did after seven years asleep you ’ re at the beginning of something you said and i ’ m at the end of something but you didn ’ t go away twice-born three times coming around rough cello late days i want to drive to your grave but i don ’ t belong to it
fluid melodic getting more and more drastic the moment she gives in to him she regrets it a throat a chest trying to press themselves a current of air air through the mask all the flourishes in the world the fingers the foot trilling the breath keen responding to recitative closing and opening out from the head with the hands carry it through the aria carry it through the chorus when finally does waltzes a solo but not alone “ let 's waltz a rumba '' never gives in to the waltz never embellished motifs mimetic sign language as clear gesture displacing singers he likes this sound muted and pronounced effort of error she likes this sound weight irrepressible effort of eros they talk about their differences w/out trying to change or be changed regretting herself where do we meet each other w/out trying to hang or be caged
there is a smile of love and there is a smile of deceit and there is a smile of smiles in which these two smiles meet and there is a frown of hate and there is a frown of disdain and there is a frown of frowns which you strive to forget in vain for it sticks in the hearts deep core and it sticks in the deep back bone and no smile that ever was smild but only one smile alone that betwixt the cradle grave it only once smild can be but when it once is smild theres an end to all misery
the snow is deep on the ground always the light falls softly down on the hair of my belovèd this is a good world the war has failed god shall not forget us who made the snow waits where love is only a few go mad the sky moves in its whiteness like the withered hand of an old king god shall not forget us who made the sky knows of our love the snow is beautiful on the ground and always the lights of heaven glow softly down on the hair of my belovèd
so we 'll go no more a roving so late into the night though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright for the sword outwears its sheath and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe and love itself have rest though the night was made for loving and the day returns too soon yet we 'll go no more a roving by the light of the moon

saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west the bride was a red girl her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders on a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand she had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach ’ d to her feet the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him and brought water and fill ’ d a tub for his sweated body and bruis ’ d feet and gave him a room that enter ’ d from my own and gave him some coarse clean clothes and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass ’ d north i had him sit next me at table my fire-lock lean ’ d in the corner 11

glisten ’ d with wet it ran from their long hair little streams pass ’ d all over their bodies an unseen hand also pass ’ d over their bodies it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs the

four horses the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain the negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard steady and tall he stands pois ’ d on one leg on the string-piece his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band his glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead the sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black of his polish ’ d and perfect limbs i behold the picturesque giant and love him and i do not stop there i go with the team also in me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as forward sluing to niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing absorbing all to myself and for this song oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade

they slowly circle around i believe in those wing ’ d purposes and acknowledge red yellow white playing within me and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else and the jay in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me 14 the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night ya-honk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation the pert may suppose it meaningless but i listening close find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky the sharp-hoof ’ d moose of the north the cat on the house-sill the chickadee the prairie-dog the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats the brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings i see in them and myself the same old law the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections they scorn the best i can do to relate them i am enamour ’ d of growing out-doors of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls and the drivers of horses i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out what is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is me me going in for my chances spending for vast returns adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me not

dark where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides where the cheese-cloth hangs in

there with his roll ’ d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel not objecting to special revelations considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction their brawny limbs passing safe over

half enough dung and dirt more admirable than was dream ’ d the supernatural of no account myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes the day getting ready for me when i shall do as much good as the best and be as prodigious by my life-lumps becoming already a creator putting myself here and now to the ambush ’ d womb of the shadows 42 a call in the midst of the crowd my own voice orotund sweeping and final come my children come my boys and girls my women household and intimates now the performer launches his nerve he has pass ’ d his prelude on the reeds within easily written loose-finger ’ d chords—i feel the thrum of your climax and close my head slues round on my neck music rolls but not from the organ folks are around me but they are no household of mine ever the hard unsunk ground ever the eaters and drinkers ever the upward and downward sun ever the air and the ceaseless tides ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real ever the old inexplicable query ever that thorn ’ d thumb that breath of itches and thirsts ever the vexer ’ s hoot hoot till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death here and there with dimes on the eyes walking to feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning tickets buying taking selling but in to the feast never once going many sweating ploughing thrashing and then the chaff for payment receiving a few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming this is the city and i am one of the citizens whatever interests the rest interests me politics wars markets newspapers schools the mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factories stocks stores real estate and personal estate the

is deathless with me what i do and say the same waits for them every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them i know perfectly well my own egotism know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less and would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself not words of routine this song of mine but abruptly to question to leap beyond yet nearer bring this printed and bound book—but the

over my faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern believing i shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks in the circle of obis helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist drinking mead from the skull-cup to shastas and vedas admirant minding the koran walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knife beating the serpent-skin drum accepting the gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing assuredly that he is divine to the mass kneeling or the puritan ’ s prayer rising or sitting patiently in a pew ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey down-hearted doubters dull and excluded frivolous sullen moping angry affected dishearten ’ d atheistical i know every one of you i know the sea of torment doubt despair and unbelief how the flukes splash how they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers i take my place among you as much as among any the past is the push of you me all precisely the same and what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all precisely the same i do not know what is untried and afterward but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient and can not fail each who passes is consider ’ d each who stops is consider ’ d not a single one can it fail it can not fail the young man who died and was buried nor the young woman who died and was put by his side nor the little child that peep ’ d in at the door and then drew back and was never seen again nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with bitterness worse than gall nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder nor the numberless slaughter ’ d and wreck ’ d nor the brutish koboo call ’ d the ordure of humanity nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them nor the present nor the least wisp that is known 44 it is time to explain myself—let us stand up what is known i strip away i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown the clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them births have brought us richness and variety and other births will bring us richness and variety i do not call one greater and one smaller that which fills its period and place is equal to any were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister i am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation what have i to do with lamentation i am an acme of things accomplish ’ d and i an encloser of things to be my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs on every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps all below duly travel ’ d and still i mount and mount rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist and took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon long i was hugg ’ d close—long and long immense have been the preparations for me faithful and friendly the arms that have help ’ d me cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings they sent influences to look after what was to hold me before i was born out of my mother generations guided me my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it for it the nebula cohered to an orb the long slow strata piled to rest it on vast vegetables gave it sustenance monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care all forces have been steadily employ ’ d to complete and delight me now on this spot i stand with my robust soul 45 o span of youth ever-push ’ d elasticity o manhood balanced florid and full my lovers suffocate me crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night crying by day ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging and chirping over my head calling my name from flower-beds vines tangled underbrush lighting on every moment of my life bussing my body with soft balsamic busses noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine old age superbly rising o welcome ineffable grace of dying days every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows after and out of itself and the dark hush promulges as much as any i open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding outward and outward and forever outward my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit and greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage if i you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would not avail in the long run we should surely bring up again where we now stand and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do not hazard the span or make it impatient they are but parts any thing is but a part see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that count ever so much there is limitless time around that my rendezvous is appointed it is certain the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there 46 i know i have the best of time and space and was never measured and never will be measured i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all my signs are a rain-proof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair i have no chair no church no philosophy i lead no man to a dinner-table library exchange but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll my left hand hooking you round the waist my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road not i not any one else can travel that road for you you must travel it for yourself it is not far it is within reach perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land shoulder your duds dear son and i will mine and let us hasten forth wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go if you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip and in due time you shall repay the same service to me for after we start we never lie by again this day before dawn i ascended a hill and look ’ d at the crowded heaven and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we be fill ’ d and satisfied then and my spirit said no we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond you are also asking me questions and i hear you i answer that i can not answer you must find out for yourself sit a while dear son here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes i kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence long enough have you dream ’ d contemptible dreams now i wash the gum from your eyes you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore now i will you to be a bold swimmer to jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout and laughingly dash with your hair 47 i am the teacher of athletes he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own right wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts first-rate to ride to fight to hit the bull ’ s eye to sail a skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers and those well-tann ’ d to those that keep out of the sun i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me i follow you whoever you are from the present hour my words itch at your ears till you understand them i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while i wait for a boat it is you talking just as much as myself i act as the tongue of you tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosen ’ d i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house and i swear i will never translate myself at all only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air if you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore the nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves a key the maul the oar the hand-saw second my words no shutter ’ d room or school can commune with me but roughs and little children better than they the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day the farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice in vessels that sail my words sail i go with fishermen and seamen and love them the soldier camp ’ d or upon the march is mine on the night ere the pending battle many seek me and i do not fail them on that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me my face rubs to the hunter ’ s face when he lies down alone in his blanket the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon the young mother and old mother comprehend me the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are they and all would resume what i have told them 48 i have said that the soul is not more than the body and i have said that the body is not more than the soul and nothing not god is greater to one than one ’ s self is and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel ’ d universe and i say to any man or woman let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes and i say to mankind be not curious about god for i who am curious about each am not curious about god no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and about death i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself why should i wish to see god better than this day i see something of god each hour of the twenty-four and each moment then in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass i find letters from god dropt in the street and every one is sign ’ d by god ’ s name and i leave them where they are for i know that wheresoe ’ er i go others will punctually come for ever and ever 49 and as to you death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to try to alarm me to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes i see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape and as to you corpse i think you are good manure but that does not offend me i smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing i reach to the leafy lips i reach to the polish ’ d breasts of melons and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven o suns—o grass of graves—o perpetual transfers and promotions if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight toss sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small 50 there is that in me—i do not know what it is—but i know it is in me wrench ’ d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes i sleep—i sleep long i do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol something it swings on more than the earth i swing on to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me perhaps i might tell more outlines i plead for my brothers and sisters do you see o my brothers and sisters it is not chaos or death—it is form union plan—it is eternal life—it is happiness 51 the past and present wilt—i have fill ’ d them emptied them and proceed to fill my next fold of the future listener up there what have you to confide to me look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening talk honestly no one else hears you and i stay only a minute longer do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the door-slab who has done his day ’ s work who will soonest be through with his supper who wishes to walk with me will you speak before i am gone will you prove already too late 52 the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gab and my loitering i too am not a bit tamed i too am untranslatable i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world the last scud of day holds back for me it flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow ’ d wilds it coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk i depart as air i shake my white locks at the runaway sun i effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love if you want me again look for me under your boot-soles you will hardly know who i am or what i mean but i shall be good health to you nevertheless and filter and fibre your blood failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged missing me one place search another i stop somewhere waiting for you
let me call a ghost love so it be little in december we took no thought for the weather whom now shall i thank for this wealth of water your heart loves harbors where i am a stranger where was it we lay needing no other twelve days and twelve nights in each other ’ s eyes or was it at babel and the days too small we spoke our own tongue needing no other if a seed grow green set a stone upon it that it learn thereby holy charity if you must smile always on that other cut me from ear to ear and we all smile together
sweetest love i do not go for weariness of thee nor in hope the world can show a fitter love for me but since that i must die at last 't is best to use myself in jest thus by feign 'd deaths to die yesternight the sun went hence and yet is here today he hath no desire nor sense nor half so short a way then fear not me but believe that i shall make speedier journeys since i take more wings and spurs than he o how feeble is man 's power that if good fortune fall can not add another hour nor a lost hour recall but come bad chance and we join to'it our strength and we teach it art and length itself o'er us to'advance when thou sigh'st thou sigh'st not wind but sigh'st my soul away when thou weep'st unkindly kind my life 's blood doth decay it can not be that thou lov'st me as thou say'st if in thine my life thou waste that art the best of me let not thy divining heart forethink me any ill destiny may take thy part and may thy fears fulfil but think that we are but turn 'd aside to sleep they who one another keep alive ne'er parted be
from measure for measure take oh take those lips away that so sweetly were forsworn and those eyes the breake of day lights that do mislead the morn but my kisses bring again bring again seals of love but sealed in vain sealed in vain
ask not the cause why sullen spring so long delays her flow'rs to bear why warbling birds forget to sing and winter storms invert the year chloris is gone and fate provides to make it spring where she resides chloris is gone the cruel fair she cast not back a pitying eye but left her lover in despair to sigh to languish and to die ah how can those fair eyes endure to give the wounds they will not cure great god of love why hast thou made a face that can all hearts command that all religions can invade and change the laws of ev'ry land where thou hadst plac 'd such pow'r before thou shouldst have made her mercy more when chloris to the temple comes adoring crowds before her fall she can restore the dead from tombs and ev'ry life but mine recall i only am by love design'd to be the victim for mankind
drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss but in the cup and i ’ ll not look for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of jove ’ s nectar sup i would not change for thine i sent thee late a rosy wreath not so much honouring thee as giving it a hope that there it could not withered be but thou thereon didst only breathe and sent ’ st it back to me since when it grows and smells i swear not of itself but thee
ask me no more where jove bestows when june is past the fading rose for in your beauty 's orient deep these flowers as in their causes sleep ask me no more whither doth stray the golden atoms of the day for in pure love heaven did prepare those powders to enrich your hair ask me no more whither doth haste the nightingale when may is past for in your sweet dividing throat she winters and keeps warm her note ask me no more where those stars light that downwards fall in dead of night for in your eyes they sit and there fixed become as in their sphere ask me no more if east or west the phoenix builds her spicy nest for unto you at last she flies and in your fragrant bosom dies
wintah summah snow er shine hit 's all de same to me ef only i kin call you mine an keep you by my knee ha'dship frolic grief er caih content by night an day ef only i kin see you whaih you wait beside de way livin dyin smiles er teahs my soul will still be free ef only thoo de comin yeahs you walk de worl wid me bird-song breeze-wail chune er moan what puny t'ings dey 'll be ef w'en i 's seemin all erlone i knows yo hea't 's wid me
from an evening 's love you charm 'd me not with that fair face though it was all divine to be another 's is the grace that makes me wish you mine the gods and fortune take their part who like young monarchs fight and boldly dare invade that heart which is another 's right first mad with hope we undertake to pull up every bar but once possess 'd we faintly make a dull defensive war now every friend is turn 'd a foe in hope to get our store and passion makes us cowards grow which made us brave before
when i consider everything that grows holds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and check 'd even by the selfsame sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new
devouring time blunt thou the lion 's paws and make the earth devour her own sweet brood pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws and burn the long-liv 'd phoenix in her blood make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets and do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed time to the wide world and all her fading sweets but i forbid thee one more heinous crime o carve not with the hours my love 's fair brow nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen him in thy course untainted do allow for beauty 's pattern to succeeding men yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong my love shall in my verse ever live young
let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlook 'd for joy in that i honour most great princes favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the sun 's eye and in themselves their pride lies buried for at a frown they in their glory die the painful warrior famoused for fight after a thousand victories once foil 'd is from the book of honour razed quite and all the rest forgot for which he toil 'd then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed
when in disgrace with fortune and men ’ s eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries and look upon myself and curse my fate wishing me like to one more rich in hope featured like him like him with friends possessed desiring this man ’ s art and that man ’ s scope with what i most enjoy contented least yet in these thoughts myself almost despising haply i think on thee and then my state like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven ’ s gate for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste then can i drown an eye unus 'd to flow for precious friends hid in death 's dateless night and weep afresh love 's long since cancell 'd woe and moan th expense of many a vanish 'd sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restor 'd and sorrows end
if thou survive my well-contented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re-survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bettering of the time and though they be outstripp 'd by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought '' had my friend 's muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style i 'll read his for his love ''
full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with all-triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth
what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helen 's cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessèd shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart
when i have seen by time 's fell hand defac'd the rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see down-ras'd and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the wat'ry main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away this thought is as a death which can not choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose
tir 'd with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimm 'd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplac 'd and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgrac 'd and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue-tied by authority and folly doctor-like controlling skill and simple truth miscall 'd simplicity and captive good attending captain ill. tir 'd with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone
no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o if i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone
that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruin 'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang in me thou see'st the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away death 's second self that seals up all in rest in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the death-bed whereon it must expire consum 'd with that which it was nourish 'd by this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong to love that well which thou must leave ere long
you rose from our embrace and the small light spread like an aureole around you the long parabola of neck and shoulder flank and thigh i saw permute itself through unfolding and unlimited minuteness in the movement of your tall tread the spine-root swaying the picasso-like éclat of scissoring slender legs i knew some law of being was at work at one time i had said that love bestows such values and so it does but the old man in his canto was right and wise ubi amor ibi ocullus est always i wanted to give and in wanting was the poet a man now aging i know the best of love is not to bestow but to recognize
not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control suppos 'd as forfeit to a confin 'd doom the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assur'd and peace proclaims olives of endless age now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes since spite of him i 'll live in this poor rhyme while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes and thou in this shalt find thy monument when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
alas 't is true i have gone here and there and made myself a motley to the view gor 'd mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear made old offences of affections new most true it is that i have look 'd on truth askance and strangely but by all above these blenches gave my heart another youth and worse essays prov 'd thee my best of love now all is done have what shall have no end mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof to try an older friend a god in love to whom i am confin 'd then give me welcome next my heaven the best even to thy pure and most most loving breast
let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wand'ring bark whose worth 's unknown although his height be taken love 's not time 's fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle 's compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me prov 'd i never writ nor no man ever lov 'd
th expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action lust is perjured murd'rous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust enjoyed no sooner but despisèd straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and proved a very woe before a joy proposed behind a dream all this the world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red than her lips red if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damasked red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground and yet by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth ... ... these rebel powers that thee array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge is this thy body 's end then soul live thou upon thy servant 's loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead there 's no more dying then
i thought once how theocritus had sung of the sweet years the dear and wished for years who each one in a gracious hand appears to bear a gift for mortals old or young and as i mused it in his antique tongue i saw in gradual vision through my tears the sweet sad years the melancholy years those of my own life who by turns had flung a shadow across me straightway i was 'ware so weeping how a mystic shape did move behind me and drew me backward by the hair and a voice said in mastery while i strove ... guess now who holds thee '—death i said but there the silver answer rang ... not death but love
if thou must love me let it be for nought except for love 's sake only do not say i love her for her smile ... her look ... her way of speaking gently ... for a trick of thought that falls in well with mine and certes brought a sense of pleasant ease on such a day'— for these things in themselves belovèd may be changed or change for thee —and love so wrought may be unwrought so neither love me for thine own dear pity 's wiping my cheeks dry — a creature might forget to weep who bore thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby but love me for love 's sake that evermore thou may'st love on through love 's eternity
beloved my beloved when i think that thou wast in the world a year ago what time i sate alone here in the snow and saw no footprint heard the silence sink no moment at thy voice ... but link by link went counting all my chains as if that so they never could fall off at any blow struck by thy possible hand ... why thus i drink of life 's great cup of wonder wonderful never to feel thee thrill the day or night with personal act or speech —nor ever cull some prescience of thee with the blossoms white thou sawest growing atheists are as dull who can not guess god 's presence out of sight
when our two souls stand up erect and strong face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher until the lengthening wings break into fire at either curvéd point — what bitter wrong can the earth do to us that we should not long be here contented think in mounting higher the angels would press on us and aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song into our deep dear silence let us stay rather on earth belovèd — where the unfit contrarious moods of men recoil away and isolate pure spirits and permit a place to stand and love in for a day with darkness and the death-hour rounding it
i lived with visions for my company instead of men and women years ago and found them gentle mates nor thought to know a sweeter music than they played to me but soon their trailing purple was not free of this world 's dust — their lutes did silent grow and i myself grew faint and blind below their vanishing eyes then thou didst come ... to be belovèd what they seemed their shining fronts their songs their splendours better yet the same as river-water hallowed into fonts met in thee and from out thee overcame my soul with satisfaction of all wants — because god 's gifts put man 's best dreams to shame
my letters all dead paper ... mute and white — and yet they seem alive and quivering against my tremulous hands which loose the string and let them drop down on my knee to-night this said ... he wished to have me in his sight once as a friend this fixed a day in spring to come and touch my hand ... a simple thing yet i wept for it — this ... the paper 's light ... said dear i love thee and i sank and quailed as if god 's future thundered on my past this said i am thine — and so its ink has paled with lying at my heart that beat too fast and this ... o love thy words have ill availed if what this said i dared repeat at last
if i leave all for thee wilt thou exchange and be all to me shall i never miss home-talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors ... another home than this nay wilt thou fill that place by me which is filled by dead eyes too tender to know change that 's hardest if to conquer love has tried to conquer grief tries more ... as all things prove for grief indeed is love and grief beside alas i have grieved so i am hard to love yet love me—wilt thou open thine heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
how do i love thee let me count the ways i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace i love thee to the level of every day ’ s most quiet need by sun and candle-light i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood ’ s faith i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death poetry out loud note in the print anthology this poem is titled simply `` how do i love thee let me count the ways '' the student may give either title during their recitation
the face of all the world is changed i think since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul move still oh still beside me as they stole betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink of obvious death where i who thought to sink was caught up into love and taught the whole of life in a new rhythm the cup of dole god gave for baptism i am fain to drink and praise its sweetness sweet with thee anear the names of country heaven are changed away for where thou art or shalt be there or here and this ... this lute and song ... loved yesterday the singing angels know are only dear because thy name moves right in what they say
sorrow like a ceaseless rain beats upon my heart people twist and scream in pain — dawn will find them still again this has neither wax nor wane neither stop nor start people dress and go to town i sit in my chair all my thoughts are slow and brown standing up or sitting down little matters or what gown or what shoes i wear
her red dress hat tease the sky ’ s level- headed blue outside a country depot she could be a harlot or saint on sunday morning we know hopper could slant light till it falls on our faces she waits for a tall blues singer whose twelve-string is hours out of hock for a pullman porter with a pigskin wallet bulging with greenbacks who stepped out of porgy at intermission this is paradise made of pigment tissue where apples ripen into rage lust in a quick glance beyond skincolor she ’ s his muse his wife— the same curves to her stance the same breasts beneath summer cloth
now that the winter 's gone the earth hath lost her snow-white robes and now no more the frost candies the grass or casts an icy cream upon the silver lake or crystal stream but the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth and makes it tender gives a sacred birth to the dead swallow wakes in hollow tree the drowsy cuckoo and the humble-bee now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring in triumph to the world the youthful spring the valleys hills and woods in rich array welcome the coming of the long'd-for may now all things smile only my love doth lour nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power to melt that marble ice which still doth hold her heart congeal 'd and makes her pity cold the ox which lately did for shelter fly into the stall doth now securely lie in open fields and love no more is made by the fireside but in the cooler shade amyntas now doth with his chloris sleep under a sycamore and all things keep time with the season only she doth carry june in her eyes in her heart january
there be none of beauty 's daughters with a magic like thee and like music on the waters is thy sweet voice to me when as if its sound were causing the charmed ocean 's pausing the waves lie still and gleaming and the lull 'd winds seem dreaming and the midnight moon is weaving her bright chain o'er the deep whose breast is gently heaving as an infant 's asleep so the spirit bows before thee to listen and adore thee with a full but soft emotion like the swell of summer 's ocean
still to be neat still to be dressed as you were going to a feast still to be powdered still perfumed lady it is to be presumed though art 's hid causes are not found all is not sweet all is not sound give me a look give me a face that makes simplicity a grace robes loosely flowing hair as free such sweet neglect more taketh me than all th'adulteries of art they strike mine eyes but not my heart
what thing unto mine ear wouldst thou convey —what secret thing o wandering water ever whispering surely thy speech shall be of her thou water o thou whispering wanderer what message dost thou bring say hath not love leaned low this hour beside thy far well-head and there through jealous hollowed fingers said the thing that most i long to know— murmuring with curls all dabbled in thy flow and washed lips rosy red he told it to thee there where thy voice hath a louder tone but where it welters to this little moan his will decrees that i should hear now speak for with the silence is no fear and i am all alone shall time not still endow one hour with life and i and she slake in one kiss the thirst of memory say streams lest love should disavow thy service and the bird upon the bough sing first to tell it me what whisperest thou nay why name the dead hours i mind them well their ghosts in many darkened doorways dwell with desolate eyes to know them by that hour must still be born ere it can die of that i 'd have thee tell but hear before thou speak withhold i pray the vain behest that while the maze hath still its bower for quest my burning heart should cease to seek be sure that love ordained for souls more meek his roadside dells of rest stream when this silver thread in flood-time is a torrent brown may any bulwark bind thy foaming crown shall not the waters surge and spread and to the crannied boulders of their bed still shoot the dead drift down let no rebuke find place in speech of thine or it shall prove that thou dost ill expound the words of love even as thine eddy 's rippling race would blur the perfect image of his face i will have none thereof o learn and understand that 'gainst the wrongs himself did wreak love sought her aid until her shadowy cheek and eyes beseeching gave command and compassed in her close compassionate hand my heart must burn and speak for then at last we spoke what eyes so oft had told to eyes through that long-lingering silence whose half-sighs alone the buried secret broke which with snatched hands and lips reverberate stroke then from the heart did rise but she is far away now nor the hours of night grown hoar bring yet to me long gazing from the door the wind-stirred robe of roseate gray and rose-crown of the hour that leads the day when we shall meet once more dark as thy blinded wave when brimming midnight floods the glen — bright as the laughter of thy runnels when the dawn yields all the light they crave even so these hours to wound and that to save are sisters in love 's ken oh sweet her bending grace then when i kneel beside her feet and sweet her eyes o'erhanging heaven and sweet the gathering folds of her embrace and her fall'n hair at last shed round my face when breaths and tears shall meet beneath her sheltering hair in the warm silence near her breast our kisses and our sobs shall sink to rest as in some still trance made aware that day and night have wrought to fulness there and love has built our nest and as in the dim grove when the rains cease that hushed them long 'mid glistening boughs the song-birds wake to song — so from our hearts deep-shrined in love while the leaves throb beneath around above the quivering notes shall throng till tenderest words found vain draw back to wonder mute and deep and closed lips in closed arms a silence keep subdued by memory 's circling strain — the wind-rapt sound that the wind brings again while all the willows weep then by her summoning art shall memory conjure back the sere autumnal springs from many a dying year born dead and bitter to the heart the very ways where now we walk apart who then shall cling so near and with each thought new-grown some sweet caress or some sweet name low-breathed shall let me know her thought the same making me rich with every tone and touch of the dear heaven so long unknown that filled my dreams with flame pity and love shall burn in her pressed cheek and cherishing hands and from the living spirit of love that stands between her lips to soothe and yearn each separate breath shall clasp me round in turn and loose my spirit 's bands oh passing sweet and dear then when the worshipped form and face are felt at length in darkling close embrace round which so oft the sun shone clear with mocking light and pitiless atmosphere in many an hour and place ah me with what proud growth shall that hour 's thirsting race be run while for each several sweetness still begun afresh endures love 's endless drouth sweet hands sweet hair sweet cheeks sweet eyes sweet mouth each singly wooed and won yet most with the sweet soul shall love 's espousals then be knit what time the governing cloud sheds peace from it o'er tremulous wings that touch the goal and on the unmeasured height of love 's control the lustral fires are lit therefore when breast and cheek now part from long embraces free — each on the other gazing shall but see a self that has no need to speak all things unsought yet nothing more to seek — one love in unity o water wandering past — albeit to thee i speak this thing o water thou that wanderest whispering thou keep'st thy counsel to the last what spell upon thy bosom should love cast its secret thence to wring nay must thou hear the tale of the past days —the heavy debt of life that obdurate time withholds —ere yet to win thine ear these prayers prevail and by thy voice love 's self with high all-hail yield up the amulet how should all this be told — all the sad sum of wayworn days — heart 's anguish in the impenetrable maze and on the waste uncoloured wold the visible burthen of the sun grown cold and the moon 's labouring gaze alas shall hope be nurs'd on life 's all-succouring breast in vain and made so perfect only to be slain or shall not rather the sweet thirst even yet rejoice the heart with warmth dispers'd and strength grown fair again stands it not by the door — love 's hour—till she and i shall meet with bodiless form and unapparent feet that cast no shadow yet before though round its head the dawn begins to pour the breath that makes day sweet its eyes invisible watch till the dial 's thin-thrown shade be born —yea till the journeying line be laid upon the point that wakes the spell and there in lovelier light than tongue can tell its presence stands array 'd its soul remembers yet those sunless hours that passed it by and still it hears the night 's disconsolate cry and feels the branches wringing wet cast on its brow that may not once forget dumb tears from the blind sky but oh when now her foot draws near for whose sake night and day were long in weary longing sighed away — the hour of love 'mid airs grown mute shall sing beside the door and love 's own lute thrill to the passionate lay thou know'st for love has told within thine ear o stream how soon that song shall lift its sweet appointed tune o tell me for my lips are cold and in my veins the blood is waxing old even while i beg the boon so in that hour of sighs assuaged shall we beside this stone yield thanks for grace while in thy mirror shown the twofold image softly lies until we kiss and each in other 's eyes is imaged all alone still silent can no art of love 's then move thy pity nay to thee let nothing come that owns his sway let happy lovers have no part with thee nor even so sad and poor a heart as thou hast spurned to-day to-day lo night is here the glen grows heavy with some veil risen from the earth or fall'n to make earth pale and all stands hushed to eye and ear until the night-wind shake the shade like fear and every covert quail ah by another wave on other airs the hour must come which to thy heart my love shall call me home between the lips of the low cave against that night the lapping waters lave and the dark lips are dumb but there love 's self doth stand and with life 's weary wings far flown and with death 's eyes that make the water moan gathers the water in his hand and they that drink know nought of sky or land but only love alone o soul-sequestered face far off —o were that night but now so even beside that stream even i and thou through thirsting lips should draw love 's grace and in the zone of that supreme embrace bind aching breast and brow o water whispering still through the dark into mine ears — as with mine eyes is it not now with hers — mine eyes that add to thy cold spring wan water wandering water weltering this hidden tide of tears
i have been here before but when or how i can not tell i know the grass beyond the door the sweet keen smell the sighing sound the lights around the shore you have been mine before — how long ago i may not know but just when at that swallow 's soar your neck turn 'd so some veil did fall —i knew it all of yore has this been thus before and shall not thus time 's eddying flight still with our lives our love restore in death 's despite and day and night yield one delight once more
come we to the summer to the summer we will come for the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of bloom and the crow is on the oak a-building of her nest and love is burning diamonds in my true lover 's breast she sits beneath the whitethorn a-plaiting of her hair and i will to my true lover with a fond request repair i will look upon her face i will in her beauty rest and lay my aching weariness upon her lovely breast the clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom of may the merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day and the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest in the whitethorn bush where i will lean upon my lover 's breast i 'll lean upon her breast and i 'll whisper in her ear that i can not get a wink o'sleep for thinking of my dear i hunger at my meat and i daily fade away like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day

they flee from me that sometime did me seek with naked foot stalking in my chamber i have seen them gentle tame and meek that now are wild and do not remember that sometime they put themself in danger to take bread at my hand and now they range busily seeking with a continual change thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise twenty times better but once in special in thin array after a pleasant guise when her loose gown from her shoulders did fall and she me caught in her arms long and small therewithall sweetly did me kiss and softly said “ dear heart how like you this ” it was no dream i lay broad waking but all is turned thorough my gentleness into a strange fashion of forsaking and i have leave to go of her goodness and she also to use newfangleness but since that i so kindly am served i would fain know what she hath deserved

yes in the sea of life enisled with echoing straits between us thrown dotting the shoreless watery wild we mortal millions live alone the islands feel the enclasping flow and then their endless bounds they know but when the moon their hollows lights and they are swept by balms of spring and in their glens on starry nights the nightingales divinely sing and lovely notes from shore to shore across the sounds and channels pour— oh then a longing like despair is to their farthest caverns sent for surely once they feel we were parts of a single continent now round us spreads the watery plain— oh might our marges meet again who order 'd that their longing 's fire should be as soon as kindled cool 'd who renders vain their deep desire — a god a god their severance ruled and bade betwixt their shores to be the unplumb 'd salt estranging sea

and does the heart grow old you know in the indiscriminate green of summer or in earliest snow a landscape is another scene inchoate and anonymous and every rock and bush and drift as our affections alter us will alter with the season ’ s shift so love by love we come at last as through the exclusions of a rhyme or the exactions of a past to the simplicity of time the antiquity of grace where yet we live in terror and delight with love as quiet as regret and love like anger in the night
to one who has been long in city pent 't is very sweet to look into the fair and open face of heaven —to breathe a prayer full in the smile of the blue firmament who is more happy when with heart 's content fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair of wavy grass and reads a debonair and gentle tale of love and languishment returning home at evening with an ear catching the notes of philomel —an eye watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career he mourns that day so soon has glided by e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear that falls through the clear ether silently

i wanted to be sure to reach you though my ship was on the way it got caught in some moorings i am always tying up and then deciding to depart in storms and at sunset with the metallic coils of the tide around my fathomless arms i am unable to understand the forms of my vanity or i am hard alee with my polish rudder in my hand and the sun sinking to you i offer my hull and the tattered cordage of my will the terrible channels where the wind drives me against the brown lips of the reeds are not all behind me yet i trust the sanity of my vessel and if it sinks it may well be in answer to the reasoning of the eternal voices the waves which have kept me from reaching you

before our lives divide for ever while time is with us and hands are free time swift to fasten and swift to sever hand from hand as we stand by the sea i will say no word that a man might say whose whole life 's love goes down in a day for this could never have been and never though the gods and the years relent shall be is it worth a tear is it worth an hour to think of things that are well outworn of fruitless husk and fugitive flower the dream foregone and the deed forborne though joy be done with and grief be vain time shall not sever us wholly in twain earth is not spoilt for a single shower but the rain has ruined the ungrown corn it will grow not again this fruit of my heart smitten with sunbeams ruined with rain the singing seasons divide and depart winter and summer depart in twain it will grow not again it is ruined at root the bloodlike blossom the dull red fruit though the heart yet sickens the lips yet smart with sullen savour of poisonous pain i have given no man of my fruit to eat i trod the grapes i have drunken the wine had you eaten and drunken and found it sweet this wild new growth of the corn and vine this wine and bread without lees or leaven we had grown as gods as the gods in heaven souls fair to look upon goodly to greet one splendid spirit your soul and mine in the change of years in the coil of things in the clamour and rumour of life to be we drinking love at the furthest springs covered with love as a covering tree we had grown as gods as the gods above filled from the heart to the lips with love held fast in his hands clothed warm with his wings o love my love had you loved but me we had stood as the sure stars stand and moved as the moon moves loving the world and seen grief collapse as a thing disproved death consume as a thing unclean twain halves of a perfect heart made fast soul to soul while the years fell past had you loved me once as you have not loved had the chance been with us that has not been i have put my days and dreams out of mind days that are over dreams that are done though we seek life through we shall surely find there is none of them clear to us now not one but clear are these things the grass and the sand where sure as the eyes reach ever at hand with lips wide open and face burnt blind the strong sea-daisies feast on the sun the low downs lean to the sea the stream one loose thin pulseless tremulous vein rapid and vivid and dumb as a dream works downward sick of the sun and the rain no wind is rough with the rank rare flowers the sweet sea mother of loves and hours shudders and shines as the grey winds gleam turning her smile to a fugitive pain mother of loves that are swift to fade mother of mutable winds and hours a barren mother a mother-maid cold and clean as her faint salt flowers i would we twain were even as she lost in the night and the light of the sea where faint sounds falter and wan beams wade break and are broken and shed into showers the loves and hours of the life of a man they are swift and sad being born of the sea hours that rejoice and regret for a span born with a man 's breath mortal as he loves that are lost ere they come to birth weeds of the wave without fruit upon earth i lose what i long for save what i can my love my love and no love for me it is not much that a man can save on the sands of life in the straits of time who swims in sight of the great third wave that never a swimmer shall cross or climb some waif washed up with the strays and spars that ebb-tide shows to the shore and the stars weed from the water grass from a grave a broken blossom a ruined rhyme there will no man do for your sake i think what i would have done for the least word said i had wrung life dry for your lips to drink broken it up for your daily bread body for body and blood for blood as the flow of the full sea risen to flood that yearns and trembles before it sink i had given and lain down for you glad and dead yea hope at highest and all her fruit and time at fullest and all his dower i had given you surely and life to boot were we once made one for a single hour but now you are twain you are cloven apart flesh of his flesh but heart of my heart and deep in one is the bitter root and sweet for one is the lifelong flower to have died if you cared i should die for you clung to my life if you bade me played my part as it pleased you — these were the thoughts that stung the dreams that smote with a keener dart than shafts of love or arrows of death these were but as fire is dust or breath or poisonous foam on the tender tongue of the little snakes that eat my heart i wish we were dead together to-day lost sight of hidden away out of sight clasped and clothed in the cloven clay out of the world 's way out of the light out of the ages of worldly weather forgotten of all men altogether as the world 's first dead taken wholly away made one with death filled full of the night how we should slumber how we should sleep far in the dark with the dreams and the dews and dreaming grow to each other and weep laugh low live softly murmur and muse yea and it may be struck through by the dream feel the dust quicken and quiver and seem alive as of old to the lips and leap spirit to spirit as lovers use sick dreams and sad of a dull delight for what shall it profit when men are dead to have dreamed to have loved with the whole soul 's might to have looked for day when the day was fled let come what will there is one thing worth to have had fair love in the life upon earth to have held love safe till the day grew night while skies had colour and lips were red would i lose you now would i take you then if i lose you now that my heart has need and come what may after death to men what thing worth this will the dead years breed lose life lose all but at least i know o sweet life 's love having loved you so had i reached you on earth i should lose not again in death nor life nor in dream or deed yea i know this well were you once sealed mine mine in the blood 's beat mine in the breath mixed into me as honey in wine not time that sayeth and gainsayeth nor all strong things had severed us then not wrath of gods nor wisdom of men nor all things earthly nor all divine nor joy nor sorrow nor life nor death i had grown pure as the dawn and the dew you had grown strong as the sun or the sea but none shall triumph a whole life through for death is one and the fates are three at the door of life by the gate of breath there are worse things waiting for men than death death could not sever my soul and you as these have severed your soul from me you have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer but will it not one day in heaven repent you will they solace you wholly the days that were will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss meet mine and see where the great love is and tremble and turn and be changed content you the gate is strait i shall not be there but you had you chosen had you stretched hand had you seen good such a thing were done i too might have stood with the souls that stand in the sun 's sight clothed with the light of the sun but who now on earth need care how i live have the high gods anything left to give save dust and laurels and gold and sand which gifts are goodly but i will none o all fair lovers about the world there is none of you none that shall comfort me my thoughts are as dead things wrecked and whirled round and round in a gulf of the sea and still through the sound and the straining stream through the coil and chafe they gleam in a dream the bright fine lips so cruelly curled and strange swift eyes where the soul sits free free without pity withheld from woe ignorant fair as the eyes are fair would i have you change now change at a blow startled and stricken awake and aware yea if i could would i have you see my very love of you filling me and know my soul to the quick as i know the likeness and look of your throat and hair i shall not change you nay though i might would i change my sweet one love with a word i had rather your hair should change in a night clear now as the plume of a black bright bird your face fail suddenly cease turn grey die as a leaf that dies in a day i will keep my soul in a place out of sight far off where the pulse of it is not heard far off it walks in a bleak blown space full of the sound of the sorrow of years i have woven a veil for the weeping face whose lips have drunken the wine of tears i have found a way for the failing feet a place for slumber and sorrow to meet there is no rumour about the place nor light nor any that sees or hears i have hidden my soul out of sight and said `` let none take pity upon thee none comfort thy crying for lo thou art dead lie still now safe out of sight of the sun have i not built thee a grave and wrought thy grave-clothes on thee of grievous thought with soft spun verses and tears unshed and sweet light visions of things undone `` i have given thee garments and balm and myrrh and gold and beautiful burial things but thou be at peace now make no stir is not thy grave as a royal king 's fret not thyself though the end were sore sleep be patient vex me no more sleep what hast thou to do with her the eyes that weep with the mouth that sings '' where the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten the cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by the misconceived and the misbegotten i would find a sin to do ere i die sure to dissolve and destroy me all through that would set you higher in heaven serve you and leave you happy when clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind am i. your lithe hands draw me your face burns through me i am swift to follow you keen to see but love lacks might to redeem or undo me as i have been i know i shall surely be '' what should such fellows as i do '' nay my part were worse if i chose to play for the worst is this after all if they knew me not a soul upon earth would pity me and i play not for pity of these but you if you saw with your soul what man am i you would praise me at least that my soul all through clove to you loathing the lives that lie the souls and lips that are bought and sold the smiles of silver and kisses of gold the lapdog loves that whine as they chew the little lovers that curse and cry there are fairer women i hear that may be but i that i love you and find you fair who are more than fair in my eyes if they be do the high gods know or the great gods care though the swords in my heart for one were seven should the iron hollow of doubtful heaven that knows not itself whether night-time or day be reverberate words and a foolish prayer i will go back to the great sweet mother mother and lover of men the sea i will go down to her i and none other close with her kiss her and mix her with me cling to her strive with her hold her fast o fair white mother in days long past born without sister born without brother set free my soul as thy soul is free o fair green-girdled mother of mine sea that art clothed with the sun and the rain thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine thy large embraces are keen like pain save me and hide me with all thy waves find me one grave of thy thousand graves those pure cold populous graves of thine wrought without hand in a world without stain i shall sleep and move with the moving ships change as the winds change veer in the tide my lips will feast on the foam of thy lips i shall rise with thy rising with thee subside sleep and not know if she be if she were filled full with life to the eyes and hair as a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips with splendid summer and perfume and pride this woven raiment of nights and days were it once cast off and unwound from me naked and glad would i walk in thy ways alive and aware of thy ways and thee clear of the whole world hidden at home clothed with the green and crowned with the foam a pulse of the life of thy straits and bays a vein in the heart of the streams of the sea fair mother fed with the lives of men thou art subtle and cruel of heart men say thou hast taken and shalt not render again thou art full of thy dead and cold as they but death is the worst that comes of thee thou art fed with our dead o mother o sea but when hast thou fed on our hearts or when having given us love hast thou taken away o tender-hearted o perfect lover thy lips are bitter and sweet thine heart the hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover shall they not vanish away and apart but thou thou art sure thou art older than earth thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover from the first thou wert in the end thou art and grief shall endure not for ever i know as things that are not shall these things be we shall live through seasons of sun and of snow and none be grievous as this to me we shall hear as one in a trance that hears the sound of time the rhyme of the years wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow as tender things of a spring-tide sea sea-fruit that swings in the waves that hiss drowned gold and purple and royal rings and all time past was it all for this times unforgotten and treasures of things swift years of liking and sweet long laughter that wist not well of the years thereafter till love woke smitten at heart by a kiss with lips that trembled and trailing wings there lived a singer in france of old by the tideless dolorous midland sea in a land of sand and ruin and gold there shone one woman and none but she and finding life for her love 's sake fail being fain to see her he bade set sail touched land and saw her as life grew cold and praised god seeing and so died he died praising god for his gift and grace for she bowed down to him weeping and said '' live '' and her tears were shed on his face or ever the life in his face was shed the sharp tears fell through her hair and stung once and her close lips touched him and clung once and grew one with his lips for a space and so drew back and the man was dead o brother the gods were good to you sleep and be glad while the world endures be well content as the years wear through give thanks for life and the loves and lures give thanks for life o brother and death for the sweet last sound of her feet her breath for gifts she gave you gracious and few tears and kisses that lady of yours rest and be glad of the gods but i how shall i praise them or how take rest there is not room under all the sky for me that know not of worst or best dream or desire of the days before sweet things or bitterness any more love will not come to me now though i die as love came close to you breast to breast i shall never be friends again with roses i shall loathe sweet tunes where a note grown strong relents and recoils and climbs and closes as a wave of the sea turned back by song there are sounds where the soul 's delight takes fire face to face with its own desire a delight that rebels a desire that reposes i shall hate sweet music my whole life long the pulse of war and passion of wonder the heavens that murmur the sounds that shine the stars that sing and the loves that thunder the music burning at heart like wine an armed archangel whose hands raise up all senses mixed in the spirit 's cup till flesh and spirit are molten in sunder — these things are over and no more mine these were a part of the playing i heard once ere my love and my heart were at strife love that sings and hath wings as a bird balm of the wound and heft of the knife fairer than earth is the sea and sleep than overwatching of eyes that weep now time has done with his one sweet word the wine and leaven of lovely life i shall go my ways tread out my measure fill the days of my daily breath with fugitive things not good to treasure do as the world doth say as it saith but if we had loved each other — o sweet had you felt lying under the palms of your feet the heart of my heart beating harder with pleasure to feel you tread it to dust and death — ah had i not taken my life up and given all that life gives and the years let go the wine and honey the balm and leaven the dreams reared high and the hopes brought low come life come death not a word be said should i lose you living and vex you dead i never shall tell you on earth and in heaven if i cry to you then will you hear

can life be a blessing or worth the possessing can life be a blessing if love were away ah no though our love all night keep us waking and though he torment us with cares all the day yet he sweetens he sweetens our pains in the taking there 's an hour at the last there 's an hour to repay in ev'ry possessing the ravishing blessing in ev'ry possessing the fruit of our pain poor lovers forget long ages of anguish whate'er they have suffer 'd and done to obtain 'tis a pleasure a pleasure to sigh and to languish when we hope when we hope to be happy again

falling in love with a mustache is like saying you can fall in love with the way a man polishes his shoes which of course is one of the things that turns on my tuned-up engine those trim buckled boots i feel like an advertisement for men ’ s fashions when i think of your ankles yeats was hung up with a girl ’ s beautiful face and i find myself a bad moralist a failing aesthetician a sad poet wanting to touch your arms and feel the muscles that make a man ’ s body have so much substance that makes a woman lean and yearn in that direction that makes her melt/ she is a rainy day in your presence the pool of wax under a burning candle the foam from a waterfall you are more beautiful than any harley-davidson she is the rain waits in it for you finds blood spotting her legs from the long ride
with the man i love who loves me not i walked in the street-lamps flare we watched the world go home that night in a flood through union square i leaned to catch the words he said that were light as a snowflake falling ah well that he never leaned to hear the words my heart was calling and on we walked and on we walked past the fiery lights of the picture shows — where the girls with thirsty eyes go by on the errand each man knows and on we walked and on we walked at the door at last we said good-bye i knew by his smile he had not heard my heart 's unuttered cry with the man i love who loves me not i walked in the street-lamps flare — but oh the girls who ask for love in the lights of union square
there is no stillness in this wood the quiet of this clearing is the denial of my hearing the sounds i should there is no vision in this glade this tower of sun revealing the timbered scaffoldage is stealing essence from shade only my love is love ’ s ideal the love i could discover in these recesses knows no lover is the unreal the undefined unanalysed unabsolute many it is antithesis of any in none comprised
unstable dream according to the place be steadfast once or else at least be true by tasted sweetness make me not to rue the sudden loss of thy false feignèd grace by good respect in such a dangerous case thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew but madest my sprite live my care to renew my body in tempest her succour to embrace the body dead the sprite had his desire painless was th'one th'other in delight why then alas did it not keep it right returning to leap into the fire and where it was at wish it could not remain such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain
i forgot how lush and electrified it was with you the shaggy fragrant zaps continually passing back and forth my fingertip to your clavicle or your wrist rubbing mine to share gardenia oil we so purred like dragonflies we kept the mosquitoes away and the conversation was heavy mother-lacerated childhoods and the sad way we 'd both been both ignored and touched badly knowing that being fierce and proud and out and loud was just a bright new way to be needy please listen to me oh what a buzz you 're the only one i can tell even with no secret i could come close to your ear with my mouth and that was ecstasy too we barely touched each other we did n't have to speak the love we made leapt to life like a cat in the space between us if there ever was space between us and looked back at us through fog sure this was san francisco it was often hard to see but fog always burned off too so we watched this creature to see if it knew what it was doing it did n't
it 's not about the sex really it 's not the ache of the bruised nipple or the burn left by his two-day-old beard in the crook of my neck where the pulse is taken it's his breathing when asleep that draws me near when i was seventeen i 'd check beside me hope i had n't rolled and squashed flat my one-year-old brother his sigh on my ear the rise and fall of air beneath his ribs was a miracle to me the nightly surprise of what i saw under the bulb's dim glow i saw the small heart beating like wings unfolding in the body here with this man ideas of flight return
whenas in silks my julia goes then then methinks how sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes next when i cast mine eyes and see that brave vibration each way free o how that glittering taketh me
i have lost and lately these many dainty mistresses stately julia prime of all sappho next a principal smooth anthea for a skin white and heaven-like crystalline sweet electra and the choice myrrha for the lute and voice next corinna for her wit and the graceful use of it with perilla all are gone only herrick 's left alone for to number sorrow by their departures hence and die
as virtuous men pass mildly away and whisper to their souls to go whilst some of their sad friends do say the breath goes now and some say no so let us melt and make no noise no tear-floods nor sigh-tempests move 'twere profanation of our joys to tell the laity our love moving of th earth brings harms and fears men reckon what it did and meant but trepidation of the spheres though greater far is innocent dull sublunary lovers love whose soul is sense can not admit absence because it doth remove those things which elemented it but we by a love so much refined that our selves know not what it is inter-assured of the mind care less eyes lips and hands to miss our two souls therefore which are one though i must go endure not yet a breach but an expansion like gold to airy thinness beat if they be two they are two so as stiff twin compasses are two thy soul the fixed foot makes no show to move but doth if the other do and though it in the center sit yet when the other far doth roam it leans and hearkens after it and grows erect as that comes home such wilt thou be to me who must like th other foot obliquely run thy firmness makes my circle just and makes me end where i begun
highlight actions disable annotations let me pour forth my tears before thy face whilst i stay here for thy face coins them and thy stamp they bear and by this mintage they are something worth for thus they be pregnant of thee fruits of much grief they are emblems of more when a tear falls that thou falls which it bore so thou and i are nothing then when on a diverse shore on a round ball a workman that hath copies by can lay an europe afric and an asia and quickly make that which was nothing all so doth each tear which thee doth wear a globe yea world by that impression grow till thy tears mix 'd with mine do overflow this world by waters sent from thee my heaven dissolved so o more than moon draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere weep me not dead in thine arms but forbear to teach the sea what it may do too soon let not the wind example find to do me more harm than it purposeth since thou and i sigh one another 's breath whoe'er sighs most is cruellest and hastes the other 's death
after the steaming bodies swept through the hungry streets of swollen cities after the vast pink spawning of family poisoned the rivers and ravaged the prairies after the gamble of latex and diaphragms and pills i invoked the white robes gleaming blades ready for blood and feeling the scourge of increase and multiply made affirmation yes deliver us from complicity and after the precision of scalpels i woke to a landscape of sunshine where the catbird mates for life and maps trace out no alibis—stepped into a morning of naked truth where acts mean what they really are the purity of loving for the sake of love
tell me was venus more beautiful than you are when she topped the crinkled waves drifting shoreward on her plaited shell was botticelli ’ s vision fairer than mine and were the painted rosebuds he tossed his lady of better worth than the words i blow about you to cover your too great loveliness as with a gauze of misted silver for me you stand poised in the blue and buoyant air cinctured by bright winds treading the sunlight and the waves which precede you ripple and stir the sands at my feet
i above the fresh ruffles of the surf bright striped urchins flay each other with sand they have contrived a conquest for shell shucks and their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed gaily digging and scattering and in answer to their treble interjections the sun beats lightning on the waves the waves fold thunder on the sand and could they hear me i would tell them o brilliant kids frisk with your dog fondle your shells and sticks bleached by time and the elements but there is a line you must not cross nor ever trust beyond it spry cordage of your bodies to caresses too lichen-faithful from too wide a breast the bottom of the sea is cruel ii —and yet this great wink of eternity of rimless floods unfettered leewardings samite sheeted and processioned where her undinal vast belly moonward bends laughing the wrapt inflections of our love take this sea whose diapason knells on scrolls of silver snowy sentences the sceptred terror of whose sessions rends as her demeanors motion well or ill all but the pieties of lovers ’ hands and onward as bells off san salvador salute the crocus lustres of the stars in these poinsettia meadows of her tides — adagios of islands o my prodigal complete the dark confessions her veins spell mark how her turning shoulders wind the hours and hasten while her penniless rich palms pass superscription of bent foam and wave — hasten while they are true —sleep death desire close round one instant in one floating flower bind us in time o seasons clear and awe o minstrel galleons of carib fire bequeath us to no earthly shore until is answered in the vortex of our grave the seal ’ s wide spindrift gaze toward paradise iii infinite consanguinity it bears— this tendered theme of you that light retrieves from sea plains where the sky resigns a breast that every wave enthrones while ribboned water lanes i wind are laved and scattered with no stroke wide from your side whereto this hour the sea lifts also reliquary hands and so admitted through black swollen gates that must arrest all distance otherwise — past whirling pillars and lithe pediments light wrestling there incessantly with light star kissing star through wave on wave unto your body rocking and where death if shed presumes no carnage but this single change — upon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn the silken skilled transmemberment of song permit me voyage love into your hands ... iv whose counted smile of hours and days suppose i know as spectrum of the sea and pledge vastly now parting gulf on gulf of wings whose circles bridge i know from palms to the severe chilled albatross ’ s white immutability no stream of greater love advancing now than singing this mortality alone through clay aflow immortally to you all fragrance irrefragably and claim madly meeting logically in this hour and region that is ours to wreathe again portending eyes and lips and making told the chancel port and portion of our june— shall they not stem and close in our own steps bright staves of flowers and quills today as i must first be lost in fatal tides to tell in signature of the incarnate word the harbor shoulders to resign in mingling mutual blood transpiring as foreknown and widening noon within your breast for gathering all bright insinuations that my years have caught for islands where must lead inviolably blue latitudes and levels of your eyes — in this expectant still exclaim receive the secret oar and petals of all love v meticulous past midnight in clear rime infrangible and lonely smooth as though cast together in one merciless white blade— the bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits —as if too brittle or too clear to touch the cables of our sleep so swiftly filed already hang shred ends from remembered stars one frozen trackless smile ... what words can strangle this deaf moonlight for we are overtaken now no cry no sword can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge slow tyranny of moonlight moonlight loved and changed ... “ there ’ s nothing like this in the world ” you say knowing i can not touch your hand and look too into that godless cleft of sky where nothing turns but dead sands flashing “ —and never to quite understand ” no in all the argosy of your bright hair i dreamed nothing so flagless as this piracy but now draw in your head alone and too tall here your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam your breath sealed by the ghosts i do not know draw in your head and sleep the long way home vi where icy and bright dungeons lift of swimmers their lost morning eyes and ocean rivers churning shift green borders under stranger skies steadily as a shell secretes its beating leagues of monotone or as many waters trough the sun ’ s red kelson past the cape ’ s wet stone o rivers mingling toward the sky and harbor of the phoenix ’ breast— my eyes pressed black against the prow —thy derelict and blinded guest waiting afire what name unspoke i can not claim let thy waves rear more savage than the death of kings some splintered garland for the seer beyond siroccos harvesting the solstice thunders crept away like a cliff swinging or a sail flung into april ’ s inmost day— creation ’ s blithe and petalled word to the lounged goddess when she rose conceding dialogue with eyes that smile unsearchable repose— still fervid covenant belle isle —unfolded floating dais before which rainbows twine continual hair— belle isle white echo of the oar the imaged word it is that holds hushed willows anchored in its glow it is the unbetrayable reply whose accent no farewell can know
i want a red dress i want it flimsy and cheap i want it too tight i want to wear it until someone tears it off me i want it sleeveless and backless this dress so no one has to guess what ’ s underneath i want to walk down the street past thrifty ’ s and the hardware store with all those keys glittering in the window past mr. and mrs. wong selling day-old donuts in their café past the guerra brothers slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders i want to walk like i ’ m the only woman on earth and i can have my pick i want that red dress bad i want it to confirm your worst fears about me to show you how little i care about you or anything except what i want when i find it i ’ ll pull that garment from its hanger like i ’ m choosing a body to carry me into this world through the birth-cries and the love-cries too and i ’ ll wear it like bones like skin it ’ ll be the goddamned dress they bury me in
be the mistress of my choice clean in manners clear in voice be she witty more than wise pure enough though not precise be she showing in her dress like a civil wilderness that the curious may detect order in a sweet neglect be she rolling in her eye tempting all the passers by and each ringlet of her hair an enchantment or a snare for to catch the lookers on but herself held fast by none let her lucrece all day be thais in the night to me be she such as neither will famish me nor overfill
what needeth these threnning words and wasted wind all this can not make me restore my prey to rob your good iwis is not my mind nor causeless your fair hand did i display let love be judge or else whom next we meet that may both hear what you and i can say she took from me an heart and i a glove from her let us see now if th'one be worth th'other
what should i say since faith is dead and truth away from you is fled should i be led with doubleness nay nay mistress i promised you and you promised me to be as true as i would be but since i see your double heart farewell my part though for to take it is not my mind but to forsake one so unkind and as i find so will i trust farewell unjust can ye say nay but you said that i alway should be obeyed and thus betrayed or that i wiste— farewell unkissed
tonight i will remember the model with the wide sad mouth who used to pose for father because i love the dangers of memory the boarded window and door rooms where one bare bulb makes shadows swell up the wall and yet i recall only vaguely the way her hem rustled on the floor like sand against tin laisse-moi tranquille epicier it said because i want it to say something memorable i want her back that brilliant farfetched woman who drank coffee in our garden and the days father fed me absinthe through a sugar cube so i would be asleep by noon and wake to find ramona posing naked with a tambourine tonight the whole world is a garden in which the immortal whispers something about art and its opportunities memory like a bolt of silk in a tailor ’ s arms can be made into anything especially misfortune especially the year ramona spent in a wrath almost biblical and so far from the world not even the moon could find her study in paris where the doors opened to the river
when i have fears that i may cease to be before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain before high-pilèd books in charactery hold like rich garners the full ripened grain when i behold upon the night ’ s starred face huge cloudy symbols of a high romance and think that i may never live to trace their shadows with the magic hand of chance and when i feel fair creature of an hour that i shall never look upon thee more never have relish in the faery power of unreflecting love—then on the shore of the wide world i stand alone and think till love and fame to nothingness do sink
when thou must home to shades of underground and there arriv 'd a new admired guest the beauteous spirits do engirt thee round white iope blithe helen and the rest to hear the stories of thy finish 'd love from that smooth tongue whose music hell can move then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights of masques and revels which sweet youth did make of tourneys and great challenges of knights and all these triumphs for thy beauty 's sake when thou hast told these honours done to thee then tell o tell how thou didst murder me
when you are old and grey and full of sleep and nodding by the fire take down this book and slowly read and dream of the soft look your eyes had once and of their shadows deep how many loved your moments of glad grace and loved your beauty with love false or true but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you and loved the sorrows of your changing face and bending down beside the glowing bars murmur a little sadly how love fled and paced upon the mountains overhead and hid his face amid a crowd of stars
whoso list to hunt i know where is an hind but as for me hélas i may no more the vain travail hath wearied me so sore i am of them that farthest cometh behind yet may i by no means my wearied mind draw from the deer but as she fleeth afore fainting i follow i leave off therefore sithens in a net i seek to hold the wind who list her hunt i put him out of doubt as well as i may spend his time in vain and graven with diamonds in letters plain there is written her fair neck round about noli me tangere for caesar 's i am and wild for to hold though i seem tame
wild nights wild nights were i with thee wild nights should be our luxury futile the winds to a heart in port done with the compass done with the chart rowing in eden ah the sea might i but moor tonight in thee
i would like to decorate this silence but my house grows only cleaner and more plain the glass chimes i hung over the register ring a little when the heat goes on i waited too long to drink my tea it was not hot it was only warm
lightning hits the roof shoves the knife darkness deep in the walls they bleed light all over us and your face the fan folds up so i won ’ t see how afraid to be with me you are we don ’ t mix even in bed where we keep ending up there ’ s no need to hide it you ’ re snow i ’ m coal i ’ ve got the scars to prove it but open your mouth i ’ ll give you a taste of black you won ’ t forget for a while i ’ ll let it make you strong make your heart lion then i ’ ll take it back

in a cerulean ruckus of quilts we played house off the big room where they laughed slowdragged weekends the eagle flies on friday the jukebox pulsed a rainbow through the papery walls we were paid a dollar to guard each other i was eight s. c. mae fourteen as we experimented with the devil mill workers changed money in the briny glow of bootleg overpowered by the smell of collards catfish candied yams granddaddy gabriel worked the cash register beside his second wife rosie belle i heard my mother father laugh like swimmers underwater a raw odor of lilies sweat filled the room my cousin ’ s hands moved over me smooth tough as a blues guitar somebody swore they saw a silhouette with a gasoline can the night s. c. mae ran away with a woman ’ s husband for weeks they sifted ashes but the gutted studs braces only leaned against the wind weak as a boy girl entwined on the floor that june granddaddy drove a busload up north the growers paid him a dollar a day for each pair of hands he wanted to rebuild those nights their circle of blurred cards the bus grunted between orchards by late august i had enough fire-blackened nickels dimes to fill a sock but only a few pickers came back after a season of wine-stained greenbacks sewn inside coats taped to the soles of their feet
naked before the glass she said “ i see my body as no man has nor any shall unless i wed and naked in a stranger ’ s house stand timid beside his bed there is no pity in the flesh. ” “ or else i shall grow old ” she said “ alone and change my likeliness for a vile slack shape a head shriveled with thinking wickedness against the day i must be dead and eaten by my crabbed wish. ” “ one or the other way ” she said “ how shall i know the difference when wrinkles come to spinster or bride whether to marry or burn is bless- ed best o stranger to my bed there is no pity in the flesh ”

give me hunger o you gods that sit and give the world its orders give me hunger pain and want shut me out with shame and failure from your doors of gold and fame give me your shabbiest weariest hunger but leave me a little love a voice to speak to me in the day end a hand to touch me in the dark room breaking the long loneliness in the dusk of day-shapes blurring the sunset one little wandering western star thrust out from the changing shores of shadow let me go to the window watch there the day-shapes of dusk and wait and know the coming of a little love
each time we moved to a new apartment and we did three times i knew i should n't that i should leave while i had the chance but each time we moved to a new apartment we were desperate had been kicked out or priced out and we only had one bed no savings just friends some of whom knew that you fractured your hand punching through a wall inches from my head and some of whom were aware that you threw things at me when i said things you did n't like as if my words were things i threw at you first it made sense to you i ca n't remember the bad things i said—my self-serving memory enraged you and why not i always remembered the bad things you did and yes i do remember everything you threw a chair over our heads at a bar liz was there a mirror like a frisbee aimed at my knees a carton of fried rice that splat on the shade of our only nice lamp oil stains patterned it with tiny bugs also you threw me against a wall but you always said it was because i made you so mad because you loved me so much and did n't want to lose me that you 'd lose control instead and later beg me to stay that if i left you it meant you would never be loved and i couldn't bear to have you think that about either one of us i was n't someone who 'd let herself be hit i 'd never take that from a man a man would be a criminal if he did what you did but you had been hurt and all that pain and anger needed more time and i made you so crazy i was so stubborn and good at mean words what else were you supposed to do you liked to raise your fist pretending to hit me and then half-smile when i winced or cringed it was important that you had never actually hit me never punched me with a closed fist you 'd only grabbed me and choked me and flung me and made dents in the wall next to me and narrowly missed me but we knew you meant to miss never truly meant to clobber me on the head with something heavy something light maybe like a book i loved when a woman you love hits you on the head with a book you love is that love i was so ashamed and afraid someone would find out about us then i was afraid and ashamed people already knew but did n't know what to do did i really think this was a secret not from the cops we called during two bad fights or from peggy who let you stay with her rent-free that month i kicked you out you two had a blast but i could n't pay the rent on my own so you moved back in triumphant peggy still in love with you and you gloated about how much money you 'd saved surrounded by friends whom could i tell why would i tell anyone who didn't already know us well enough to already know if everyone knew none of us said so we talked all of us almost constantly intimately so how did we keep ourselves so quiet you and i together in this were alone with this alone among women who loved us the two of us never more alone than when together
—seoul korea 1971 father gave her a little extra how could she not fall for him he was handsome but still a boy in the depot where soldiers took such women his skinny body clung too close to hers and his narrow ass still belonged to his mother the other men knew the routine and how much to pay she loathed their accent and american swagger the sweat would barely cool and dry before another shook the cot and bucked his hips out of rhythm—in some other time zone however he began to offer other things besides money he brought sweets from the base and the minute he touched his pocket the face she reserved for his english crumbled like sweet toffee because he did n't know how to say what he wanted to say no time was spent on uneasiness chocolate caramel and peanuts spoke best secured his place he hooked his arms through hers as if they could stroll the lane like an ordinary couple the unassuming black and the korean whore in the middle of the vietnam war

he startled to see a statue of blind justice really did loom over the courtroom but remained determined to scorn symbolism she needed a quarter to call her lover— the docket was full she ’ d be late for lunch— and he gave her one it was not a taunt acquiescence wager or plea it was a quarter the fact that they had done this— even this —together and cordially late nights at the dining room table with a bottle of cabernet sharp pencils a love supreme and an “ e-z workbook ” from the well-reviewed—the fact that they ’ d read reviews —don ’ t pay an attorney series as if they were learning portuguese or origami was not “ as if ” or “ like ” anything but just that a fact and not to be pressed for further significance this was part of the agreement they filled out the forms asked lawyer friends for language made stacks of books and towels cooked dinner together said “ excuse me ” passing in the hallway and even remembered each other ’ s mother ’ s birthdays as if not as if waiting for their case to be called they got hungry the bailiff pointed toward the snack bar in the basement which was packed with a class trip from the school for the blind in illo tempore such a gift would have caused them to turn to each other in love and wonder now no they didn ’ t even look to see she asked for fish sticks and he wondered if fish sticks were fish or like fish the children chewed their chicken fingers with calm deliberation staring out at what they saw then conveyed their limp paper plates with startling grace to the hinged swinging mouths of the trash cans which swallowed everything offered saying thank you thank you
sleep she will not linger she turns her moon-cold shoulder with no ring on her finger you can not hope to hold her she turns her moon-cold shoulder and tosses off the cover you can not hope to hold her she has another lover she tosses off the cover and lays the darkness bare she has another lover her heart is otherwhere she lays the darkness bare you slowly realize her heart is otherwhere there 's distance in her eyes you slowly realize that she will never linger with distance in her eyes and no ring on her finger
open the window and you want to fly out though you never actually do— i think i see you still there on the ledge where i 've left you how pulled-awake and flung can one life be again i thought it will end again i promised and clung i learned there that to cling was in my nature i think i see you though you flash quickly through the shutter i think i hear you though i sleep remember this as a bolero a finite flaring— both the tulip tree burning in full bloom and the weeping silver birch
i can ’ t keep my eyes off the poet ’ s wife ’ s legs—they ’ re so much more beautiful than anything he might be saying though i ’ m no longer in a position really to judge having stopped listening some time ago he ’ s from the iowa writers workshop and can therefore get along fine without my attention he started in reading poems about his childhood— barns cornsnakes gradeschool flowers that sort of stuff—the loss of innocence he keeps talking about between poems which i can relate to especially under these circumstances now he ’ s on to science a poem about hydrogen i think he ’ s trying to imagine himself turning into hydrogen maybe he ’ ll succeed i ’ m imagining myself sliding up his wife ’ s fluid rhythmic lusciously curved black- stockinged legs imagining them arched around my shoulders wrapped around my back my god why doesn ’ t he write poems about her he will no doubt once she leaves him leaves him for another poet perhaps the observant uninnocent one who knows a poem when it sits down in a room with him
just then encountering my ruddy face in the grand piano 's cold black craquelure it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon dipping up over the roofs of the tenderloin only when i have done with the myths— the inner spill that triggers us to flame breasts so sensitive a moment 's touch will call down fever the dark sea-lane between limbic squall and the heart 's harbour— will i picture you just beyond innocence lying stripped by a thrown-wide window letting the cool breeze covet your ardour
according to lin yutang both po chuyi and su tungpo '' desperately admired '' tao yuanming a poet of nature who wrote a single love poem a poem thought by chinese dilettantes to be the one `` blemish in a white jade '' can a poet be faulted for calling a woman carelessly perfect in beauty he chose to long for her by envying the candle that glowed upon her beautiful face the shadow that followed in her every move yet the nature poet tao yuanming at home with the sudden turning of seasons now feared the shadow in darkness a discarded fan that once stirred her hair feared the candle at dawn at last believed that for beauty he had lived in vain
as we sat at the feet of the string quartet in their living room on a winter night through the hardwood floor spurts and gulps and tips and shudders came up and the candle-scent air was thick-alive with pearwood ebony spruce poplar and horse howled and cat skreeled and then when the grösse fugue was around us under us over us in us i felt i was hearing the genes of my birth-family pulled keening and grieving and scathing along each other scraping and craving i felt myself held in that woods of hating longing and i knew and knew myself and my parents and their parents there—and then at a distance i sensed as if it were thirty years ago a being far off yet oblique-approaching straying toward and then not toward and then toward this place like a wandering dreaming herdsman my husband and i almost wanted to warn him away to call out to him to go back whence he came into some calmer life but his beauty was too moving to me and i wanted too much to not be alone in the covert any more and so i prayed him come to me i bid him hasten and good welcome
i try to think of the cup of a hand of legs in a tangle and not the thistle though even it purpled spiking away wants to be admired wants to say whistle a little for me o every little thing wants to be loved wants to be marked by the cry that brings desire to it even blue-eyed fly to the bloated hiss of death to love is to be remiss the horse alone in the wide flat field nods its head as if the bridle and bit were missed or mocked the cow slung with the unmilked weight of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder at o lonesome me i want to say to her need as if crooning could be enough sweet sweet mama truth be told the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds honey terrifies me when the stink of slurry season is over and the greened fields are slathered fecund overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit then i dream a little dream of you and me curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf wind-driven and scudding along the lake 's surface all night we glide to its blue harbor and back again the fattened slack of us singing o darlin darlin darlin
for fred i could pick anything and think of you— this lamp the wind-still rain the glossy blue my pen exudes drying matte upon the page i could choose any hero any cause or age and sure as shooting arrows to the heart astride a dappled mare legs braced as far apart as standing in silver stirrups will allow— there you 'll be with furrowed brow and chain mail glinting to set me free one eye smiling the other firm upon the enemy this post-postmodern age is all business compact disks and faxes a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks event today a hurricane is nudging up the coast oddly male big bad floyd who brings a host of daydreams awkward reminiscences of teenage crushes on worthless boys whose only talent was to kiss you senseless they all had sissy names—marcel percy dewey were thin as licorice and as chewy sweet with a dark and hollow center floyd's cussing up a storm you 're bunkered in your aerie i 'm perched in mine twin desks computers hardwood floors we 're content but fall short of the divine still it 's embarrassing this happiness— who 's satisfied simply with what 's good for us when has the ordinary ever been news and yet because nothing else will do to keep me from melancholy call it blues i fill this stolen time with you
identification is a highly important factor in the mechanism of hysterical symptoms by this means patients are enabled in their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences but the experiences of a great number of other persons and can suffer as it were for a whole mass of people and fill all the parts of a drama by means of their own personalities alone — sigmund freud anne identified with cate until it became a bona fide illness for boris had left cate resulting not only in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream of hostility directed not at boris but at his new woman anne whom cate viewed as her rival cate remained excessively tender with boris though cate for him had been a “ totem animal ” from which he gained power by “ eating. ” whereas boris was the patriarch anne was the ego alien and whereas cate was anne ’ s fixation anne was no one ’ s obsession so she was admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden associations she could not be induced to abandon on the rare occasions she slept the manifest and latent content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment between boris and cate which anne in her waking hours projected onto the walls as though screening a silent film she could not be induced to abandon this footage she could not be induced to abandon her object love of boris whose own object choice was his ego-libido or her identification with cate who felt no friendship towards anne soon anne drew a mental triangle on every surface she saw be it phallic or concave and sometimes this triangle was isosceles sometimes it was equilateral and often it was right
while the doormat asks neurotic questions about his ex the dream girl looks at her watch if her man brings up the ex and if the man ever says “ everyone was in love with my ex ” a dream girl won ’ t ask for a photo but if a photo of the ex is provided the dream girl won ’ t demean the appearance of the ex because her man will likely rush to his ex ’ s defense the lesson is that when a man considers his ex a prize looks have little to do with it for when a woman acts like a prize a man can forget he ’ s with a battle axe what should you say when he asks questions about your ex remember you ’ re a prize so you needn ’ t report that your ex stole appliances or defaulted on child support or that your ex has a mafioso brother doing time for racketeering or that your ex is “ still stalking you ” — because your man will not find these ex stories charming if he ’ s classy so what you say about your ex is simply “ we wanted different things ” or alternatively “ my ex and i went separate ways. ” it ’ s none of his business your ex and all the vicissitudes of your past like the jewelry your ex gave you which you pawned or your violent fantasies about your ex because inquiring minds don ’ t need to know did you know that exes are a common conversation topic among men “ you remember my ex the one who snapped ... ” they might say referring to the “ terrible ” ex who was “ possessed by demons ” thus causing the inevitable ex- tramarital affair of course he never had anything to do with his ex ’ s transformation he was a perfect angel but lo and behold the ex- orcist was suddenly required women believe these narratives and ex- coriate themselves if they ’ re doormats but love is beset by variables and dream girls must take control in this world of unknowns
after the trumpets after the incense there were nights insomnia fathered gods i then rejected as too angry or distracted or whose appetite for submission revealed their own lack of faith say our names all synonyms for trust others spoke in sugared paradox to know is to know all to not know all is not to know to know all requires that you know very little but to know that little you have to know all and for a while it 's true i burned in the dark fires of ambivalence my attention consumed like oxygen i 'd wake up tired as i had with the married man whose strictures and caprice begat and begat and begat and begat my love for him harvesting the same silence from my bed who listens to my penitential tune who accepts my petitions for convenient parking for spring for the self illuminated across a kitchen table for for fortitude i 've heard a voice i 'm sure advising me to drop this sentimental farce only to hold the smoke of their names again in my mouth i 'd resurrect the dead or adopt the gods orphaned by atheists except the gods they 've made from disbelief no one 's faith could tolerate refusing to make the same mistake just once i 've cried out to the dark many names most given up as routinely as the secrets of friends if you 're a cup will my lips profane your own if a comb will i feel your teeth against my neck if a wall i will be darker than your shadow and if a door i will unlatch you letting in all the little foxes from the vineyard
sleepless in the cold dark i look through the closed dim door be- fore me which be- comes an abyss into which my memories have fallen past laughter or horror passion or hard work—my memories of our past laughter horror passion hard work an ache of be- ing an ache of being over love an ache of being over love like projections on the screen of the heavy window curtains flashing lights of a slow-scraping after- midnight snowplow for a moment pulse in this room
the chain uncouples and his jacket hangs on the peg over hers and he 's inside she stalls in the kitchen putting the kettle on buys herself a minute looking for two matching cups for the lime-flower tea not really lime but linden heart-shaped leaves and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze she talks a wall around her twists the string tighter around the tea bag in her spoon but every conversation has to break somewhere and at the far end of the sofa he sits warming his hands around the cup he has n't tasted yet and listens on with such an exasperating show of patience it 's almost a relief to hear him ask it if you 're not using your body right now maybe you 'd let me borrow it for a while it is n't what you 're thinking no it 's worse why on earth did she find him so attractive the first time she met him propping the wall at an awkward party clearly trying to drink himself into some sort of conversation was it the dark uncomfortable reserve she took upon herself to tease him out of asking are you a vampire that depends he stammered are you a virgin no not funny but why did she laugh at him what made her think that he needed her that she could teach him something why did she let him believe she was drunk and needed a ride home why did she let him take her shirt off fumble around a bit on the spare futon passing back and forth the warm breath of a half-hearted kiss they kept falling asleep in the middle of and when he asked her why did she not object i 'd like to try something i need you to trust me younger and given to daydreams she imagined trading bodies with someone a best friend the boy she had a crush on but the fact was more fantastic a fairy-tale adventure where the wolf wins and hides in the girl 's red hood how it happens she does n't really remember drifting off with a vague sense of being drawn out through a single point of her skin like a bedsheet threaded through a needle 's eye and bundled into a body that must be his sometimes she startles as on the verge of sleep you can feel yourself fall backward over a brink and snaps her eyelids open to catch herself slipping out of the bed her legs swinging over the edge and feels the sudden sick split-screen impression of being for a second both she and her what he does with her while she 's asleep she never really knows flickers only conducted back in dreams walking in neighborhoods she does n't know and would n't go to overpasses ragweed cars dry-docked on cinderblocks wolf-whistles wanting to run away and yet her steps planted sure and defiant performing tasks too odd to recognize and too mundane to have made up like fixing a green salad with the sunflower seeds and peppers that she hates pouring on twice the oil and vinegar that she would like and being unable to stop her hands feel but are somehow not her own running over the racks of stacked fabric in a clothing store stroking the slick silk teased cotton and polar fleece as if her fingers each were a tongue tasting the knits and weaves harmless enough it 's what she does n't dream that scares her panic she ca n't account for faces familiar but not known déjà vu making a mess of memory coming to with a fresh love-bite on her left breast and the aftershock of granting another 's flesh of having gripped slipped in and fluttered tender mmm unbraided and spent the whole slow day clutching her thighs to keep the chafe from fading and furious at being joyful less at the violation less the danger than the sense he 'd taken her enjoyment for his own that was the time before the time she swore would be the last—returning to her senses she 'd grabbed his throat and hit him around the face and threw him out and sat there on the floor shaking she had n't known how hard it was to throw a punch without pulling it back now as they sit together on her couch with the liquid cooling in the stained chipped cups that would never match no matter how hard she stared at them he seems the same as ever a quiet clumsy self-effacing ghost with the gray-circled eyes that she once wanted so badly to defy that seemed to see her seeing him—and she has to admit she 's missed him why she scrolls back through their conversations searching for any reason not to hate him she 'd ask him what 's it like being a girl when you 're not a girl his answers when he gave them were n't helpful so evasively poetic it 's like a sponge somebody else is squeezing a radio tuned to all stations at once like having skin that 's softer but more thick then she remembers the morning she awoke with the smear of tears still raw across her cheeks and the spent feeling of having cried herself down to the bottom of something why was i crying she asked and he looked back blankly with that little curve of a lip that served him for a smile because i ca n't and that would be their secret the power to feel another appetite pass through her like a shudder like a cold lungful of oxygen or hot sweet smoke fill her and then be stilled the freedom to fall asleep behind the blinds of his dark body and wake cleanly and when she swings her legs over the edge of the bed to trust her feet to hit the carpet and know as not before how she never quite trusted the floor to be there no not since she was a girl first learning to swim hugging her skinny breastless body close to the pool-gutter skirting along the dark and darker blue of the bottom dropping out— now she can stand and take the cup out of his giving hand and feel what they have learned inside each other fair and enough and not without a kind of satisfaction that she can put her foot down clear to the bottom of desire and find that it can stop and go no deeper
whatever it may be we may suppose it is not love for love must leave its trace like contraband seized and displayed in rows is not sufficient reason to erase the careful lives we have so far lived through— there is no call for us to undermine the walls we 've built no need to think anew of all the chains and choices that define us still and yet for all our fine intent a single touch ignites the night and tries resolve past all resisting what we meant before we mean again fidelities have yet been known to shift and come undone and all good reasons fail us one by one
`` they wo n't attack us here in the indian graveyard '' i love that moment and i love the moment when i climb into your warm you-smelling bed-dent after you 've risen and sunflowers once a whole field and i almost crashed the next year all pumpkins crop rotation i love you dividing words between syl- lables dachshunds what am i but the inter- section of these loves i spend 35 dollars on a cd of some guy with 15 different guitars in his shack with lots of tape delays and loops a good buy mexican animal crackers but only to be identified by what you love is a malformation just as embryonic chickens grow very strange in zero gravity i hate those experiments on animals varnished bats blinded rabbits cows with windows in their flanks but obviously i 'm fascinated perhaps it was my early exposure to frankenstein i love frankenstein arrgh he replies to everything fire particularly sets him off something the villagers quickly pick up fucking villagers all their shouting's making conversation impossible and now there 's grit in my lettuce which i hate but kinda like in clams as one bespeaks poor hygiene and the other the sea i hate what we 're doing to the sea dragging huge chains across the bottom bleaching reefs either you 're a rubber/ gasoline salesman or like me you 'd like to duct tape the vice president 's mouth to the exhaust pipe of an suv and i hate feeling like that i would rather concentrate on the rapidity of your ideograms how only a biochemical or two keeps me from becoming the world 's biggest lightning bug

too sound of mind the paper table cloth was tastefully bleak the misty morning light shone on his cheek and made him look alone and masculine he talked of seneca and bad translations of modern critics lightweight observations a bread crumb rested sweetly on his chin behind him through the glass the ocean 's heave uncurled against the sand beside his sleeve as eros aimed his toxic javelin i ducked out of the way to no avail it glanced my flesh injecting quite a cocktail that blurred my sight and caused my head to spin— never mind the coffee we were drinking whatever i said was not what i was thinking i wanted to become his mandolin and lie across his lap a dainty lute and sing to him and feed him ripened fruit while light upon the sea turned opaline instead this conversation about art and formal education—god he 's smart such rationality should be a sin the hour was up he had to run of course a handshake and a peck of shy remorse— outside the sea was gray and dull as tin it ruled the shore with tedious discipline
on the metro i have to ask a young woman to move the packages beside her to make room for me she ’ s reading her foot propped on the seat in front of her and barely looks up as she pulls them to her i sit take out my own book—cioran the temptation to exist—and notice her glancing up from hers to take in the title of mine and then as gombrowicz puts it she “ affirms herself physically ” that is becomes present in a way she hadn ’ t been before though she hasn ’ t moved she ’ s allowed herself to come more sharply into focus be more accessible to my sensual perception so i can ’ t help but remark her strong figure and very tan skin— how literally golden young women can look at the end of summer she leans back now and as the train rocks and her arm brushes mine she doesn ’ t pull it away she seems to be allowing our surfaces to unite the fine hairs on both our forearms sensitive alive achingly alive bring news of someone touched someone sensed and thus acknowledged known i understand that in no way is she offering more than this and in truth i have no desire for more but it ’ s still enough for me to be taken by a surge first of warmth then of something like its opposite a memory—a girl i ’ d mooned for from afar across the table from me in the library in school now our feet i thought touching touching even again and then with all i craved that touch to mean my having to realize it wasn ’ t her flesh my flesh for that gleaming time had pressed but a table leg the young woman today removes her arm now stands swaying against the lurch of the slowing train and crossing before me brushes my knee and does that thing again asserts her bodily being again gombrowicz again then quickly moves to the door of the car and descends not once looking back to my relief not looking back and i allow myself the thought that though i must be to her again as senseless as that table of my youth as wooden as unfeeling perhaps there was a moment i was not
we dine at adorno and return to my beauvoir she compliments me on my bachelard pad i pop in a santayana cd and saussure back to the couch on my way i pull out two fine kristeva wine glasses i pour some merleau-ponty and return the aristotle to descartes after pausing an unamuno i wrap my arm around her hegel her hair smells of wild lukacs and labriola our small talk expands to include dewey moore and kant i confess to her what 's in my eckhart we locke by this point we 're totally blavatsky we stretch out on the schopenhauer she slips out of her lyotard and i fumble with my levi-strauss she unhooks her buber and i pull off my spinoza i run my finger along her heraclitus as she fondles my bacon she stops to ask me if i brought any kierkegaard i nod we foucault she lights a cigarette and compares foucault to lacan i roll over and derrida
this morning as i gulp five gleaming white capsules of shark cartilage to make me strong again i want another look at the terrible eye with its nictitating membrane those extravagant fins the ampullae of lorenzini freckling its snout all of that huge body on the rippled sand in turtle grass with an entourage of neon-blue barjacks and a remora wriggling in and out of its gill-slits i even want to touch it again and this time not just with my fingertips but my palm loveline and lifeline my wrist the underside of my forearm i want to press my cheek against its chaste astonishing skin smooth as a headstone want the touch that feels like a blow the summoning touch the touch of reckoning the consummating touch as well as the stinging sandblown touch of regret the stranger 's touch on the train the reproachful touch even the last touch of a human who has lain down with a shark the touch i have spent my life so ignorant of your touch as you unbutton my shirt the searing unbearable touch

pótuia pótuia white grave goddess pity my sadness o silence of paros i am not of these about thy feet these garments and decorum i am thy brother thy lover of aforetime crying to thee and thou hearest me not i have whispered thee in thy solitudes of our loves in phrygia the far ecstasy of burning noons when the fragile pipes ceased in the cypress shade and the brown fingers of the shepherd moved over slim shoulders and only the cicada sang i have told thee of the hills and the lisp of reeds and the sun upon thy breasts and thou hearest me not pótuia pótuia thou hearest me not
i have seen the proudest stars that wander on through space even the sun and moon but not your face i have heard the violin the winds and waves rejoice in endless minstrelsy yet not your voice i have touched the trillium pale flower of the land coral anemone and not your hand i have kissed the shining feet of twilight lover-wise opened the gates of dawn— oh not your eyes i have dreamed unwonted things visions that witches brew spoken with images never with you
i. aubade the dawn is here—and the long night through i have never seen thy face though my feet have worn the patient grass at the gate of thy dwelling-place while the white moon sailed till red in the west it found the far world edge no leaflet stirred of the leaves that climb to garland thy window ledge yet the vine had quivered from root to tip and opened its flowers again if only the low moon 's light had glanced on a moving casement pane warm was the wind that entered in where the barrier stood ajar and the curtain shook with its gentle breath white as young lilies are but there came no hand all the slow night through to draw the folds aside i longed as the moon and the vine-leaves longed or to set the casement wide three times in a low-hung nest there dreamed his five sweet notes a bird and thrice my heart leaped up at the sound i thought thou hadst surely heard but now that thy praise is caroled aloud by a thousand throats awake shall i watch from afar and silently as under the moon for thy sake nay—bold in the sun i speak thy name i too and i wait no more thy hand thy face in the window niche but thy kiss at the open door ii nocturne my darling come —the wings of the dark have wafted the sunset away and there 's room for much in a summer night but no room for delay a still moon looketh down from the sky and a wavering moon looks up from every hollow in the green hills that holds a pool in its cup the woodland borders are wreathed with bloom—elder viburnum rose the young trees yearn on the breast of the wind that sighs of love as it goes the small stars drown in the moon-washed blue but the greater ones abide with vega high in the midmost place altair not far aside the glades are dusk and soft the grass where the flower of the elder gleams mist-white moth-like a spirit awake in the dark of forest dreams arcturus beckons into the east antares toward the south that sendeth a zephyr sweet with thyme to seek for thy sweeter mouth shall the blossom wake the star look down all night and have naught to see shall the reeds that sing by the wind-brushed pool say nothing of thee and me —my darling comes my arms are content my feet are guiding her way there is room for much in a summer night but no room for delay
when the sun and moon were in quadrature when the garden had become a wilderness and the clock refused to strike when the old year died and the sand walked into the sea with the neap tide when you had been too long away and your old snowblue footprints clotted and hesitated in the clay when the worry of this undone song unsung so long so loud my head i went inside and under to let the flood run free
what became of the dear strands of hair pressed against the perspiration of your lover 's brow after lovemaking as you gazed into the world of those eyes now only yours what became of any afternoon that was so vivid you forgot the present was up to its old trick of pretending it would be there always what became of the one who believed so deeply in this moment he memorized everything in it and left it for you

an hour inland from bangor maine over rolling hills in an oval pasture surrounded by giant conifers the forest floor bejeweled with ruby-studded mushrooms i watch the sheep sing if bleating could be called a song maybe someone in a grove long ago saw a man attached to a beast of burden and so the concept of the satyr was born memory is the past reversed i once went out with a sailor a spaniard from andalucía we met at sea where i worked the roulette wheel in the ship ’ s casino his legs were slightly bowed his voice gruff and torn and when he came the sound seemed to climb up not from his throat but from his feet smelling of earth and sea and grief— a deep song lorca called duende it wasn ’ t pretty his blue and red and purple briefs soaking in a bucket by the cabin door he told me once when he was a boy his grandmother had caught him trying to fuck a chicken the poor chicken he laughed his saddle-worn andalucían laugh feathers flying everywhere his grandmother screaming and what to call those half-human half-chicken kinds of days scratching and clawing at the earth bathed in dust trying not to think about the simmering anise peppercorn and broth when i visited him he met me at the airport then the long train ride south through field after field of sunflowers por la tarde families paraded por la noche only men and boys and extranjeras—foreign women— out past sunset in an empty disco six or seven guys danced throwing themselves around madly slamming into each other to blondie ’ s “ heart of glass. ” franco had died a few years back from my window that night a full moon shadows of the town square the boarded-up cathedral a cat in heat the smell of blood oranges in the morning his grandmother all in black asleep stooped in a chair outside my door nearby the ruins of an ancient roman temple goats on hind legs eating the pale green leaves from olive trees
for david cobb craig at first we had ways of talking that filled up the evening until some things could be said it was a made-up situation in which lives could be lost whatever that was now grows inside our bodies—a spongy pulpy cell— causing pieces of paper we hold in our hands to appear and disappear all i ask is to take me away from this place to another place very much like this place where we can meet and six months later be married you laughed and went with me
the inside out mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins muscles the bits of fat at her belly her small gray spleen at first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside she 's the ultimate open book he can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she 's lying poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm no need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood he just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder but before long she starts to sense that her lover like all the others before him is getting restless this is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness as a last resort she ’ ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him but eventually he ’ ll become convinced she ’ s hiding things from him and she is her perfect skin her long black hair her red mouth never chapped from exposure to sun or wind how she secretly loves that he can ’ t touch her here or here
for the geechee gullah ring shouters one of the women greeted me i love you she said she didn't know me but i believed her and a terrible new ache rolled over in my chest like in a room where the drapes have been swept back i love you i love you as she continued down the hall past other strangers each feeling pierced suddenly by pillars of heavy light i love you throughout the performance in every handclap every stomp i love you in the rusted iron chains someone was made to drag until love let them be unclasped and left empty in the center of the ring i love you in the water where they pretended to wade singing that old blood-deep song that dragged us to those banks and cast us in i love you the angles of it scraping at each throat shouldering past the swirling dust motes in those beams of light that whatever we now knew we could let ourselves feel knew to climb o woods—o dogs o tree—o gun—o girl run o miraculous many gone— o lord—o lord—o lord— is this love the trouble you promised

it ’ s not hard to imagine my ancestor—a dry season dust like chalk on her tongue—mixes spit with clay traces a river on rock next day rain why shouldn ’ t she believe in the power of rock and her own hand i carry this need for pattern and rule to see connections where there aren ’ t necessarily any after my first miscarriage i cut out soda cold cuts after the second vacuuming and air travel after the third—it ’ s chalk and spit again i circle rocks swim the icy river and when my son is born he balances the chemical equation that is this world and logic logic is my son ’ s kite good so long as you have wind string something heavier than hope to tether you
he came in his seedy brown jacket smelling of paint all thumbs a man stumbling over his own muscles unable to hold some part of himself and rock it gently she gave up seeing him come in the door wanting to show him her flat belly just an hour before looking at her own corpse in the mirror she lay there reduced neither virgin nor mother it had been decided the winter was too cold in the garage they would live with her mother the old bedroom was already prepared cleaned the door opened the solitary twin bed remained he would sleep on the porch she looked at him and tried to feel her way into the body of a woman a thing which has to be taken care of held safely in his arms she lay there trying to hold on to what she had knowing she had to let it go
herodotus says the king made a bowl to leave behind the memory of a number we don ’ t know the number we don ’ t know if it was divisible by two or three i want at the moment the number to indicate a ratio part of a proportion because the measurement of the earth depends on this the balance among things the snow at the bottom of the hill the gold garage light caged in a tree my love for my friend and the distance between us which i can ’ t bear i made a pinhole camera to demonstrate proportion and everything bright hovers on its milky eye and here is the catalogue of what hovers there smaller than itself the blue horizon and the dash at the stoplight a shell night-light the gazing ball of the sun going down against the white back fence which made it look like night in the woods lit from underneath on the wax i held these things yesterday along with two pearls that are spheres hanging from my living room ceiling my friend is smaller now and if i held my camera up to her she would give off enough light to hover pocket-sized in my hand and grand in the world

holy father i can ’ t pretend i ’ m not afraid to see you again but i ’ ll say that when the time comes i believe my courage will expand like a sponge cowboy in water my earth- father was far braver than me — coming to america he knew no english save rolling stones lyrics and how to say thanks god will his goodness roll over to my tab and if yes how soon i ’ m sorry for neglecting your myriad signs which seem obvious now as a hawk ’ s head on an empty plate i keep waking up at the bottom of swimming pools the water reflecting whatever i miss most whiskey- glass pill bottles my mother ’ s oleander which was sweet and evergreen but toxic in all its parts i know it was silly to keep what i kept from you you ’ ve always been so charmed by my weaknesses i just figured you were becoming fed up with all your making like a virtuoso trying not to smash apart her flute onstage plus my sins were practically devotional two peaches stolen from a bodega which were so sweet i savored even the bits i flossed out my teeth i know it ’ s no excuse but even thinking about them now i ’ m drooling consider the night i spent reading another man ’ s lover the dream songs in bed — we made it to “ a green living drops limply ” before we were tangled into each other cat still sleeping at our feet allow me these treasures lord time will break what doesn ’ t bend — even time even you
it ’ s common to live properly to pretend you don ’ t feel heat or grief wave nightly at miss fugue and mister goggles before diving into your nightcap before reading yourself a bedtime story or watching your beloved sink to the bottom of a lake and noting his absence in your log the next day you drop his clothes off at goodwill like a sack of mail from a warplane then hobble back to your hovel like a knight moving only in ls it is comfortable to be alive this way especially now but it makes you so vulnerable to shock — you ignore the mortgage and find a falconer ’ s glove in your yard whole hand still inside or you arrive home after a long day to discover your children have grown suddenly hideous and unlovable what i ’ m trying to say is i think it ’ s okay to accelerate around corners to grunt back at the mailman and swallow all your laundry quarters so much of everything is dumb baffle water puts out fire my diseases can become your diseases and two hounds will fight over a feather because feathers are strange all i want is to finally take off my cowboy hat and show you my jeweled horns if we slow dance i will ask you not to tug on them but secretly i will want that very much

24. zachary talks about wanting to be with someone because he feels like he can be a better person for someone else he says he does n't know what he 's doing wishes he had someone to do things for i tell him i think we are very different people theory as pure verbalism a generated knowledge with negative impact if i begin to miss someone i think `` life is bad anyway ''
i just do n't think that this is what it 's supposed to feel like shaking my big one to break the stream and make a pool for moving my tools for they only weigh half as much when moved under water i emerged in the morning covered in blood and fine acid sand and decided to remain partially submerged a little while longer itching for more exercise and cooled not by water but by air i spent the afternoon collecting sea shells and found each one heavily carved with the numbers of pretty village girls offering to take tourists to the ultimate level a spring and summer service they offer i meant to call one with a headline ready on my lips but a gull would dive down wheeling and screaming each time i tried to dial one can fool the animals but must forgive this wild beautiful country
tired of walking and checking the lines of the tourist train that trundles through this town famous for its pottery and brackish dune pools once visited by st. george and his dragon and the lady with her unicorn i stopped by at a convenient place to sit and shuck my sweet corn and let the local men hang their gates from my eyes all they could offer were other versions of myself soft and sweaty sick of the big car diet dished up by detroit and the cocktail-party and locker-room chatter i 've had to tackle while touring this country 's musky beaches choosing to drive to my next stop i found perched upon a tall chalk cliff the statue of a broad-bodied chaser so large i could never easily handle him as a top he 'd been added on to so many times over the centuries that it was only really possible to identify him by touch a little more shy perhaps than other guys his age an abstract clock-face jutting from the pack i could feel buckled around his waist and such wee-wee nuts he could only be named i whispered patience i camped there in his shadow 'til noon the next day and drove away leaving a few of my burnt bones there behind
you 'd think the sky would run out of water but it wo n't it just keeps coming down i need someone to marvel at the breath escaping from me do you have a natural resource you prefer to exploit does someone think of you and turn the channel how would you ever know have you ever zoned out during downton abbey i 'm certain of something i 'd prefer not to tell you about `` slow down '' you say but i can already see my breath and its only october walking with you is making everything watery and spazzed out like a movie about sex where i have sex and people are all like '' he 's amazing we really like his sex style '' but i digress will you please stand up when called upon to tell the audience how wonderful i was in my best moments like someone in senior management delegating things and being sure of everything but how to stop i promise i 'll make this up to you i 'll write your name on the menu board and people will come into the store all expectant of you
broadway past lincoln center and the wind is up so seems to speak saw you through the glass standing in line i swear a quiver played on your lips you were leafing through his book… —years it ’ s been years since corona heights backing into him dribble hook swish… …that beige comfy couch sipping a stem of wine his cat in my lap the townhouse saturday night—shoulder to shoulder pushing toward the piano he stops to squeeze by his eyes mine clench unclench… …what was it we found in common over drink smoke talk a college campus —his son his daughter earlier that night i rose to the city ’ s surface steam through the grate crossed crossed again down 7th past carnegie hall the greek joint as imagined chic —unlike the shirt d wore the fur of his arms at castro and market waiting for the light words were struck like steel and flint that distant august day…then his visit to spain mine to new canaan—walking through the morgan with him and what our mouths unfurled across a table of olives years later—last night… dropping me off at 58th he reaches for the door i ’ m fumbling to open leans close and plants what i ’ ve missed all these years
lash everything irredeemable to the ficus with muscle use the flexor digitorum brevis from the arch of my right foot this is how what ’ s grounded gets hitched to the rooted everything cramped into place and contemplative tight striations might as well be bindings to bodhi as body why not dump this tired mind at the foot of a tree aerial roots less caustic than an unanswered calling — or perhaps this is it to sit to ponder to ask what violated cunt what unhappy gasp what sad spat and toppling building left us blooming untoward who puts flowers on the inside of a fig except the injured or the bereft the ones who hankered hard and failed to do anything but live lush and fallible what regret is bark or bitch the world succumbs to beauty even now in the throes the sky is dark and hidden behind branches cephalic veins clotted with grief hush now finally all the face can do is flush sympathetic nervous system visible horror of wounded and wounding all inflorescence remains safe inside that place the mind opens up pear-­shaped and vast the body of every lover is unattached to hurt or hope falls in its own field of daffodils to curl fetal with singular prowess or glut

a peacock on an olive branch looks beyond the grove to the road beyond the road to the sea blank-lit where a sailboat anchors to a cove as it is morning below deck a man is pouring water into a cup listening to the radio-talk of the ships barges dead in the calms awaiting port call pleasure boats whose lights hours ago went out fishermen setting their nets for mullet as summer tavernas hang octopus to dry on their lines whisper smoke into wood ovens sweep the terraces clear of night putting the music out with morning light and for the breath of an hour it is possible to consider the waters of this sea wine-dark to remember that there was no word for blue among the ancients but there was the whirring sound before the oars of the great triremes sang out of the seam of world through pine-sieved winds silvered by salt flats until they were light enough to pass for breath from the heavens troubled enough to fell ships and darken thought — then as now the clouds pass roosters sleep in their huts the sea flattens under glass air but there is nothing to hold us there not the quiet of marble nor the luff of sail fields of thyme a vineyard at harvest and the sea filled with the bones of those in flight from wars east and south our wars their remains scavenged on the seafloor and in its caves belongings now a flotsam washed to the rocks stand here and look into the distant haze there where the holy mountain with its thousand monks wraps itself in shawls of rain then look to the west where the rubber boats tipped into the tough waves rest your eyes there remembering the words of anacreon himself a refugee of war who appears in the writings of herodotus i love and do not love i am mad and i am not mad like you he thought himself not better nor worse than anyone else
in fort wayne i drank the seniors old milwaukee old crow in indianapolis i stopped now i regret every drink i never took all around coffee grounds and eggshells this sweating a mouthful of lime as a boy i stole a mint green bra from a laundromat i took it home to try on while my parents slept filled its cups with the smallest turnips in our pantry the underwire grew into me like a strangler fig my blood roiled then as now back on earth frogspit is dripping down wild aloe spikes salmon are bullying their way upstream there is a pond i leapt into once with a lonely blonde boy when we scampered out one of us was in love i could not be held responsible for desire he could not be held at all i wonder where he is now if he looked up he might see me a sparkling i always hoped that when i died i would know why my brother will be so sad he will tell his daughter i was better than i was he will leave out my crueldrunk nights the wet mattresses my driving alone into cornfields unsure whether i ’ d drive out i wish he were here now he could be here this cave is big enough for everyone look at all the diamonds
all night i hear the noise of water sobbing all night i make night in me i make the day that begins on my account that sobs because day falls like water through night all night i hear the voice of someone seeking me out all night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling all night i write luminous messages messages of rain all night someone checks for me and i check for someone the noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia steps of someone who no longer writhes who no longer writes all night someone holds back then crosses the circle of bitter light all night i drown in your eyes become my eyes all night i prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence all night i see something lurch toward my looking something humid contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing absence blows grayly and night goes dense night the shade of the eyelids of the dead viscous night exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth without cold all night i flee from someone i lead the chase i lead the fugue i sing a song of mourning black birds over black shrouds my brain cries demented wind i leave the tense and strained hand i don ’ t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing this clatter in the night this delay this infamy this pursuit this inexistence all night i see that abandonment is me that the sole sobbing voice is me we can search with lanterns cross the shadow ’ s lie we can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart all night i ask you why all night you tell me no
what we built to hold us the year 's memory menus and daytrips after a while came loose those nights we balanced on each other 's mistakes cradling our wine twigs those branches now who knew what lived there she she she called one bird what lived there knew its place another bird splits its nest wide hinges the gap with spider silk learning to give to give to give until breaking only then— either one gives until breaking or one does not
does my little son miss the smell of his first mother i wonder as the mewl of his mouth opens toward a plastic bottle that is not her breast sudden new mother i bury my nose deep into his skullcap of ringlets his starry cheesiness in her good-bye letter to him sealed in his album with a birth certificate which now list my name as mother his first mother writes she nursed him briefly after he emerged into the second room of his world i think of milk volcanic and insistent answering the newborn ’ s gigantic thirst a primal agreement between generosity and greed sometimes i press my nose to the glass of that place where a mother and my child belong to each other i can not imagine coming between them but then i want to lick him all over with a cow ’ s thick tongue to taste him and mark him as mine so if the other mother returns she will refuse her handled calf smeared with my smell
